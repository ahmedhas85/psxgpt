# Welcome to AsfiModels

I've taught financial modeling for over a decade, still serve on public company boards, and have chased startups, including a crazy plan to make Internet access affordable for all by using a robot to wrap fiber optic cables around medium voltage power lines.

Two years ago I decided to drop everything and learn to code. AsfiModels is a name given to an effort I chase to someday perform financial analysis at the speed of thought. Unlike other efforts,  I do this solo and plan to keep it that way for a while.

As a kid I absolutely loved video games. I find programming to be the greatest video game I've ever played. Through projects like psxGPT, I want to sharpen my own foundational understanding and also share with you the joy of programming.

At a more practical level, programming opens your world to the web and gives you a chance to diversify your income streams by earning in currencies more stable than what you're used to.

You can find me on LinkedIn (Isfandiyar Shaheen) or Twitter (@AsfiShaheen).
