# Directors' Review

The Board of Directors is pleased to present the condensed interim unaudited unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements of Meezan Bank Limited for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

# Economy

Pakistan’s economy has continued its steady path toward recovery, following the substantial macroeconomic headwinds faced during 2022–2024. This recovery has been underpinned by the Federal Government’s prudent fiscal and monetary policies, structural reforms and targeted initiatives aimed at restoring investor and market confidence. Key measures included reforms in the energy sector to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency. In FY2024, Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) posted a growth of 2.4%, marking a significant rebound from a contraction of 0.2% witnessed during FY2023. This turnaround was driven by a notable recovery in industrial output, robust agricultural performance, easing inflationary pressures and a markedly improved Current Account position. Looking ahead, the economic outlook remains positive, with the State Bank of Pakistan projecting a real GDP growth of 2.5% - 3.5% for FY 2025.

Inflationary pressures, which reached historic highs in FY2023, have eased substantially. As of March 2025, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation stood at just 0.7%, its lowest level since December 1965. This remarkable decline in inflation has provided the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) the space to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, resulting in a cumulative reduction of 1,000 basis points in the Policy Rate — from 22% in June 2024 to 12% by January 2025. This sharp monetary easing is expected to become a catalyst for private sector credit growth and stimulate domestic investment and consumption.

Capital markets have responded positively to the improving macroeconomic indicators. The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) ended CY2024 at an all-time high of 115,127 points and has continued to gain in the current year, reaching 117,807 points by March 2025 — reflecting a year-to-date increase of 2.3%. The rally has been fuelled by enhanced investor sentiment, declining interest rates, improving corporate earnings and continued progress on structural economic reforms.

Financial Year (FY2025) has seen a substantial increase in workers’ remittances, which reached $28 billion during the first nine months — representing a robust year-on-year growth of 33%. This influx has been instrumental in maintaining a current account surplus and supporting the country’s external balances. Moreover, the successful negotiation of a new 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), valued at approximately $7 billion, has further bolstered market confidence and foreign exchange reserves. Reserves stood at $15.6 billion as of March 2025, broadly unchanged as compared to $15.9 billion at the end of December 2024. Exchange rate stability has also improved considerably. The Pakistani Rupee (PKR) remained relatively stable, trading at Rs. 280.2 per US Dollar in March 2025, compared to Rs. 278.6 at year-end 2024 — reflecting a controlled and orderly adjustment, supported by sound policy measures and improved external financing flows.

Overall, the macroeconomic outlook for Pakistan appears increasingly optimistic. Declining inflation, lower interest rates, strengthening foreign exchange reserves and the elimination of the current account deficit all point toward a favourable growth environment. The renewed IMF programme is expected to anchor investor confidence, enhance external buffers and support continued policy reforms; however, risks remain. The economy is still susceptible to global developments, including commodity price volatility, geopolitical tensions and shifting trade dynamics. In particular, the recent imposition of tariffs by the United States on certain trading partners — including Pakistan — could dampen export prospects and weigh on external sector performance. Moreover, the successful implementation of ongoing structural reforms would be critical to sustaining long-term growth and macroeconomic stability.

# Financial Highlights

With the blessings of Allah, Meezan Bank achieved strong results for the first quarter of 2025. Profit after Tax was Rs 22.0 billion as compared to Rs 24.9 billion in the corresponding quarter last year.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

which is a decrease of 12% mainly on account of significantly lower policy rate and higher tax regime. The Basic Earnings per Share clocked in at Rs 12.28 per share in March 2025 compared to Rs 13.92 per share - a year ago. The Bank’s Return on Equity (ROE) is reported at 36.2% while Return on Assets (ROA) is 2.3% for Q1’25. Alhamdullillah, we have consistently maintained ROE above the banking industry average in line with our focus on value creation for our shareholders. Our steady growth in profitability coupled with prudent approach of striking a balance between dividend pay-outs and profit retention has led to strong internal capital generation, boasting a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 20% plus.

We are pleased to announce that the Board has approved an interim cash dividend of Rs 7.00 (70%) for the first quarter ended on March 31, 2025. We take pride in our longstanding tradition of consistently paying dividends every year since our listing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Meezan maintained its position as the second most valuable bank in Pakistan with a market capitalisation of $ 1.58 billion, closing the quarter at Rs 444 billion, which underscores the investors’ confidence in the Bank’s management team, performance and growth prospects. Below are the financial highlights of Meezan Bank:

Returns from financing, investments and placements experienced a decrease, reaching Rs 108 billion compared to Rs 119 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year on account of the lower policy rates prevailing in the country. Throughout the quarter, the Policy Rate averaged at 12.3% compared to 22% in March 2024, representing a significant decrease of 966 basis points. Returns on deposits and other dues expensed, likewise, decreased to Rs 45.8 billion from Rs 51.9





# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

billion in March 2024, a decrease of 12%. The average OMO and window borrowings increased from Rs 138 billion in March 2024 to Rs 471 billion in the current quarter. The return on deposits during the similar period decreased from Rs 36.5 billion to Rs 26.3 billion reflecting a decline of 28%, primarily attributable to a sharp decline in average policy rate. However, this decline has been partially offset due to Minimum Deposit Rates (MDR) being applicable on Islamic Banks from 1st January 2025 onwards. On an overall basis, our net spread decreased to Rs 62 billion from Rs 67 billion in corresponding period last year, reflecting a decline of 8%.

Fee, commission and other income demonstrated strong growth, increasing by 29% to reach Rs 8.2 billion from Rs 6.4 billion in March 2024. Core fee and commission income posted a rise of 10% clocking in at Rs 5.5 billion with key contributors being debit card, branch banking and trade related income. In March 2025, our debit card portfolio reached 3.9 million, marking a 16% growth from 3.4 million in March 2024. This increase was further bolstered by a substantial rise in new card issuances, which climbed from 246,533 in Q1’24 to 319,505 in Q1’25, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 30%. In addition to portfolio expansion, card spending showed impressive growth, rising from Rs 70 billion in Q1’24 to Rs 95 billion in Q1’25, a 35% increase. A notable achievement was recorded in March 2025, when we reached the highest-ever monthly card spend of Rs 35 billion, highlighting the strong confidence and continued engagement of our customers. Foreign exchange income depicted a substantial growth over the corresponding period last year to reach Rs 1.6 billion compared to Rs 478 million in Q1’24, mainly due to better trade flows.

Operating and other expenses decreased from Rs 21.2 billion to Rs 19.6 billion with the cost to income ratio measuring at 28% in Q1’25 versus 29% in Q1’24. We remain steadfast in our commitment to cost rationalization and process automation strategies to attain a more efficient and streamlined operating cycle.

Total assets have reached a milestone of Rs 4 trillion as of March 2025 which is an increase of 3% over December 2024. Investments portfolio expanded by 10% compared to the previous year, reaching Rs 2.05 trillion. This expansion can be directly attributed to the regular Sukuk auctions by the Government of Pakistan which has eased liquidity management challenges historically faced by Islamic Banking Industry (IBI). Gross financing portfolio decreased by 7% from Rs 1.56 trillion as at December 2024 to Rs 1.44 trillion at the end of the current quarter, translating into an Advances to Deposits Ratio (ADR) of over 50%.

Meezan Bank continues to uphold exemplary asset quality, surpassing industry standards with a non-performing financing ratio at 2.1%. Meezan maintains a comfortable level of provisions against our non-performing financings translating into a coverage ratio of more than 140%.

Deposits portfolio increased by 11% over December 2024 to reach Rs 2.88 trillion as at the quarter-end. Current Account (CA) deposits constitute nearly half of the deposit book, amounting to Rs 1.41 trillion while Current and Savings Account (CASA) deposits represent 93% of the total deposit book amounting to Rs 2.68 trillion. Meezan Bank’s Roshan Digital Account (RDA) continues to experience strong growth, further reinforcing its leadership position in the industry.

As of March 2025, total inflows have exceeded USD 2.75 billion, representing 27% of the total industry inflows. With more than 127,000 active Meezan RDA accounts, the bank is providing seamless banking services to members of the Pakistani diaspora across over 145 countries worldwide. This growth is driven by the convenience and accessibility of digital banking services for Pakistanis living abroad, enabling them to efficiently manage their finances, make investments, and contribute to the economy back home.

Meezan Bank has been steadfast in its digital transformation strategy, aiming to enhance customer experiences and streamline back-office operations. Embracing a hybrid growth model, we have expanded our physical presence in underserved regions of the country while simultaneously onboarding customers digitally. Strategically dispersed across the nation, our branch network comprises of 1,052 branches across 351 cities, whereas our ATM network has grown to over 1,200 touchpoints nationwide.

# Directors' Review

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed Meezan with highest possible credit rating - 'AAA' (Triple A) rating for the Long Term and an 'A1+' (A-One Plus) rating for the Short Term, maintaining a stable outlook.

# Outlook

Meezan Bank remains dedicated to supporting the economic growth and stability of our nation by advancing the Islamic Banking Industry. We are fully aligned with the Government's strategic focus on Islamic Finance, in line with the Honourable Federal Shariat Court's (FSC) directive to transition the economy to a Shariah-compliant financial system. Our strategy emphasizes balanced growth, sector diversification and surpassing regulatory stability benchmarks. We are expanding our presence through both physical and digital channels, with a strong emphasis on delivering exceptional digital services to maintain our leadership in the industry.

This year has presented new challenges that the Bank is actively working to overcome, including the effects of a lower policy rate, the imposition of a Minimum Deposit Rate (MDR) on Savings Deposits, and a high tax regime. The Bank is focusing on growing its core CASA deposits to mitigate the effects of these headwinds.

We express our sincere gratitude to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their steadfast commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant achievements would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply grateful. We also extend our heartfelt thanks to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders, and holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Subordinated Sukuk (Tier II) for their unwavering patronage, which has been instrumental in establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to every member of our dedicated team for their hard work and unwavering commitment to advancing the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and express our gratitude to Allah Almighty for His constant blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have made notable achievements possible in such a short time. We seek His continued support, praying that He grants us the strength and wisdom to further our vision of establishing “Islamic banking as the banking of first choice."

# 23.3 Other contingent liabilities

The Income Tax Department amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2024. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against Islamic financing and related assets, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase, non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches and the levy of super tax were also raised. The matter has been decided in Bank's favour by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. Both the Bank and the tax department filed a reference with the High Court of Sindh in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost, is based on quoted
market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost are carried at cost. The fair value of
unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the
basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term financings, other
assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with
sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and
reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer financings and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfactions of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values. The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of GoP Ijarah sukuks listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah sukuks are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers. These are measured at fair value using the rates published by the valuation expert (Bloomberg). The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024. The valuation has been determined based on net asset values (NAV) declared by respective funds. The value of unquoted equity securities are determined by using different methods for different securities.

Fair value of investment in Sapphire Electric Company Limited has been determined by Dividend Discount Model (DDM) by using constant dividends streams of the entity by using various key assumptions considering economic and market conditions. Key assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate (if applicable).

The valuation has been determined through closing rates announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the quarter.

Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.
