DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

It is our pleasure to present the un-audited financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited along with the un-audited consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited and the Bank’s Subsidiaries AL Habib Capital Markets (Private) Limited and AL Habib Asset Management Limited for the period ended September 30, 2022.

Alhamdolillah, during the period under review, the performance of the Bank continued to be satisfactory. The deposits increased to Rs. 1,580.6 billion as compared to Rs. 1,309.8 billion on December 31, 2021. In the same period, advances increased to Rs. 815.0 billion from Rs. 733.8 billion, while investments increased to Rs. 1,057.5 billion from Rs. 826.6 billion. The pre-tax profit of the Bank for the nine months period ended September 30, 2022 was Rs. 28.86 billion as compared to Rs. 22.31 billion during the corresponding period last year. The profit after tax for the period ended September 30, 2022 was Rs. 14.97 billion compared with Rs. 13.93 billion during 2021.

By the Grace of Allah, the Bank now has a network of 1,052 offices, comprising 1,019 branches, 29 sub-branches, and 4 Representative Offices. Our branch network includes 165 Islamic Banking Branches and 2 Overseas Branches. Continuing with our branch expansion policy, the Bank intends to open more branches during the year 2022.

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) are AAA (Triple A) for TFC-2018 and TFC 2021, and AA+ (Double A plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual) and TFC-2022 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

We wish to thank our customers, for their continued trust and support, local & foreign correspondents for their confidence and cooperation, and the State Bank of Pakistan for their guidance. We also thank all our staff members for their sincerity, dedication and hard work.

# 34. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government securities: PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Non Government Debt securities: Market prices
- Foreign securities: Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed securities: Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Units of Mutual Fund: Net asset values declared by respective funds

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities. The provision for impairment of debt securities and loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policies, as disclosed in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.



# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Special Pool(s) PKR (Mudaraba)

# Special Pool(s) FCY (Mudaraba)

# Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS) Pool PKR (Musharaka)

IERS pool is required by SBP to facilitate the exporters under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme.

# Equity Pool

Investments with relatively higher risks such as investment in shares and mutual funds are tagged to the equity pool in order to safeguard the interest of depositors. The Bank as Mudarib in the general pool is responsible for administrative costs and cost of operating fixed assets, which are financed from equity. Furthermore, subsidized financing to employees are also financed from equity as per SBP guidelines.

# Special Mudaraba Financing Facility (MFF) Pool-Open Market Operations (OMO) Injections

Special MFF Pool for OMO Injection is created to invest the funds exclusively raised from SBP through Islamic OMO in High Quality Assets including securities that are eligible as approved securities for maintaining Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR).

# Parameters associated with risk and rewards:

Following are the key considerations attached with risk and reward of the pool:

- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organisations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules and Shariah clearance.

# 39.8.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed:

The Mudaraba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / business:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuks, shares and mutual funds
- Production and transmission of energy
- Food and allied except sugar
- Cement
- Financial
- Wheat
- Individuals
- Others (domestic whole sale, engineering goods, plastic product, etc.)

# 39.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components:

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of murabaha, cost of takaful, depreciation on ijarah assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that income.

The net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the period was 50% (31 December 2021: 50%) of net income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (31 December 2021: 50%) of net income.

After the allocation of income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government securities: PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Non Government Debt securities: Market prices
- Foreign securities: Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed securities: Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Units of Mutual Fund: Net asset values declared by respective funds



Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities. The provision for impairment of debt securities and loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 40.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components:

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of murabaha, cost of takaful, depreciation on ijarah assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that income.

The net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the period was 50% (31 December 2021: 50%) of net income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (31 December 2021: 50%) of net income.

After the allocation of income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.
