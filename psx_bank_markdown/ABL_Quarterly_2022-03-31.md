# Economic Review

Year 2022 started with less vulnerability to pandemic related uncertainty. Steady roll out of vaccines marked a significant step towards containing the virus spread. As a result, COVID-19 related restrictions have been lifted by many countries in the world. However, Global challenges of rising commodity prices and supply chain disruptions emerging from Russia-Ukraine conflict have fueled global inflation and downgraded the growth outlook. Consequently, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised global economic growth to 4.4% in 2022 from an earlier projection of 4.9%.

Owing to demand-easing monetary measures, Pakistan’s economy continued to grow at a moderate pace despite inflationary pressure and higher commodity prices. Accordingly, IMF has maintained Pakistan’s growth projection for 2022 at 4.0%.

Large Scale Manufacturing registered a growth of 7.6% during Jul-Jan FY 2021-22 as against a nominal growth of 1.8% during the comparable period last year. Most of the manufacturing sectors exhibited growth during Jul-Jan FY 2021-22.

In agriculture, Credit disbursement for Jul-Feb FY 2021-22 increased by 3.6% to stand at Rs. 836 billion compared to Rs. 806 billion last year. Wheat production is anticipated to be near the allocated target of 28.9 million tonnes.

On the external front, monthly current account deficit (CAD) reduced to US$ 545 million in February 2022; which is the lowest monthly deficit during the current fiscal year (Jul-Feb FY 2021-22). Decrease is attributable to appropriate demand-moderating measures together with increase in exports and continued higher remittances.

Exports increased by 26% during Jul-Feb FY 2021-22 to stand at US$ 25,109 million as against a contraction of 2% during the corresponding period last year. Major export contributors included Textile, Food and Others which increased by 31%, 16% and 14% respectively against contraction of 9%, 1%, and 4% in same period last year.

Imports for the period Jul-Feb FY 2021-22 stood at US$ 54,986 million as against US$ 37,212 million during Jul-Feb FY 2020-21. This 48% growth in import of goods and services has overshadowed the aforementioned impact of growth in exports. Resultantly, trade deficit increased to US$ 29,877 million during Jul-Feb FY2021-22 as compared to US$ 17,318 million in corresponding period last year.

Workers’ remittances continued to exceed US$ 2 billion mark for the 21st consecutive month in February 2022. Accumulated workers’ remittances stood at US$ 20,142 million during Jul-Feb FY 2021-22 as against US$ 18,710 million during last year; registering a growth of 8%.

Pakistan’s foreign reserves and net reserves with SBP were recorded at US$ 18,555 million and US$ 12,047 million respectively as on March 25, 2022.

During Jul-Feb 2021-22 net foreign direct investment (FDI) increased by 6% to stand at US$ 1,257 million. Net portfolio investment recorded at US$ 590 million against outflow of US$ 386 million. Total foreign investment stood at US$ 1,848 million against US$ 799 million exhibiting a strong growth of 131% compared to same period last year. Major increase is witnessed in Power, Financial Business, Communications and Oil & Gas explorations, which contributed 34%, 22%, 15% and 14% respectively to the total net FDI mix. Increase in portfolio investment is attributable to the proceeds of the Pakistan International Sukuk bond amounting to US$1 billion, offered in January 2022.

In view of prevailing political uncertainty, investor sentiments remained bearish, KSE-100 index closed at 43,551 points on March 31, 2022 compared to 47,356 points at end June 2021; decreasing by 8%. Pakistan rupee depreciated by 16% against US Dollar since June 30, 2021 to stand at Rs. 183.48 as on March 31, 2022.

Money supply (M2) and currency in circulation (CIC) witnessed a growth of 10% and 12% respectively since March 2021 to March 2022 and stood



Allied Bank Limited

at Rs. 24,851 billion and Rs. 7,298 billion respectively as on March 2022.

National consumer price index (CPI) remained in double digits for the 5th consecutive month to record at 12.7% for the month of March 2022.

Growing inflation, as a consequence of rising global commodity prices, together with risks to external stability necessitated a strong and proactive policy response. Accordingly, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) decided to raise the policy rate by 250 bps to bring it up to 12.25% on April 7, 2022.

# Financial Review

Pakistan’s banking industry navigated through various challenges emanating from domestic macroeconomic bottlenecks, rising inflationary pressures and uncertain interest rate scenario. Moreover, emerging disruptions from non-conventional payment channels concurrently pose an additional long-term challenge for the Banks. These challenges necessitate strategic shift in business models from traditional banking service provider towards technology driven dynamic banks.

Banking industry’s asset base (domestic operations) was Rs. 28,925 billion as on March 25, 2022 as compared to Rs. 28,882 billion as on December 31, 2021. Investments showed a growth of 6% to stand at Rs. 14,954 billion as on March 25, 2022. Industry deposit and gross advances recorded at Rs. 19,802 billion and Rs. 10,089 billion respectively as on March 25, 2022; decreasing by 6% and 1% from December 31, 2021.

Amidst challenging and evolving environment, Your Bank is guided by its vision ‘to become a dynamic and efficient bank providing integrated solutions in order to be first choice Bank for the customers” accelerated its efforts for value creation for all stakeholders.

The positive volumetric growth in average earning assets along with positive rate variance assisted in 64% increase in mark-up income to reach at Rs. 39,062 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Interest expense registered a growth of 104% to record at Rs. 26,521 million during the captioned period. Increase is attributable to high cost of deposit amid rising interest rate scenario.

Despite timing difference between repricing of earning assets and remunerable liabilities under rising interest rate scenario, Your Bank’s net interest income (NII) increased by 16%. NII stood at Rs. 12,542 million during quarter ended March 31, 2022 as against Rs. 10,794 million during corresponding period last year.

Fee income has increased to Rs. 2,097 million and registered a growth of 29% for the period under review. Active management of foreign currency exposure coupled with favorable SWAP curve has resulted in a sizeable increase in income from dealing in foreign currencies by 206% during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which amounted to Rs. 752 million.

Dividend income increased by 86% to Rs. 935 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 as against Rs. 504 million during corresponding period last year. Consequently, non-markup income recorded at Rs. 4,080 million during quarter ended March 31, 2022 as against Rs. 3,830 million during the corresponding period last year; registering a growth of 7%.

Despite increased inflation and continued investment towards technological transformation to cater the evolving needs of “Digital Age”, operating expense increase curtailed to 9% during quarter ended March 31, 2022 as against an increase of 11% during last year. Total non-markup expenses aggregated to Rs. 8,863 million during quarter ended March 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 8,064 million during corresponding period last year.

Going forward, Inflation is projected to remain elevated averaging 3.9% in developed economies and 5.9% in emerging markets and developing economies in 2022, before moderating in 2023.

On the domestic front, SBP expects GDP growth between the previous projected range of 4%-5% in FY 2021-22. Moreover, IMF forecasts real GDP growth of 5.0% for 2026.

Average inflation has been revised upwards to slightly over 11% in FY 2021-22 before subsiding in FY23.

The above mentioned amendments are not likely to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

Effective date of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was extended by SBP to annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022 vide SBP BPRD Circular Letter no. 24 dated July 05, 2021. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss (ECL) model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. SBP shared, “IFRS 9 application instructions”, for parallel reporting purposes only whereas the final application instructions based on parallel run results are still awaited.

In the absence of these guidelines from SBP and revision in prudential regulations, application of IFRS 9 across the banking industry is not possible, therefore these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regulation regime.

As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Bank and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Bank on aggregate sum of Rs.32,741 million (2021: 32,741 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                   |

The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                   |
| 23.3.3 While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court (FEAC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has arbitrarily adjudicated penalties against various banks including Rs.2,173 million in aggregate against Allied Bank Limited (the Bank). | Against the said judgments, the Bank had filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions (CP) in the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. The Honorable High Court granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Meanwhile, along with other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the FE Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated 15.01.2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty. |                   |

# 35 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in preparing the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2020.

# 3.1 NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE BANK

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Group for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2021. These are considered either to not be relevant or to not have any significant impact on these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

| - IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment (Amendments)                             | January 01, 2022 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |

| - Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current | January 01, 2023 |
| - Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020                               | January 01, 2022 |

# 3.2 STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS OF AND AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE

The following new standards and amendments to existing accounting standards will be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standard or amendment:

| - Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current | January 01, 2023 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Amendments to IAS 8 - Definition of Accounting Estimates                      | January 01, 2023 |
| - IAS 12 - Amendments on Deferred Tax                                           | January 01, 2023 |
| - Amendments on disclosure of Accounting Policies                               | January 01, 2023 |

The above mentioned amendments are not likely to have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements.

- Effective date of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' was extended by SBP to annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022 vide SBP BPRD Circular Letter no. 24 dated July 05, 2021. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss (ECL) model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. SBP shared, "IFRS 9 application instructions", for parallel reporting purposes only whereas the final application instructions based on parallel run results are still awaited.

In the absence of these guidelines from SBP and revision in prudential regulations, application of IFRS 9 across the banking industry is not possible, therefore these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regulation regime.

| 23.3.2 | The income tax assessments of the Group have been finalized up to and including tax year 2021 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2021, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Group before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Group and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Group on aggregate sum of Rs. 32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Group. |           |           |
|        | Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Group; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |           |           |
|        | Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005 / Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that the aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |           |

# 35 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as "held to maturity". Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 5.4 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.

1st Quarterly Report – March 2022
# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the three months period ended March 31, 2022

# Level 2:

Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.

# Level 3:

Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
