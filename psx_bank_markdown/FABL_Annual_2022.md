# Key Message <br> from the Chairman 

In a year of difficult economic environment, Faysal Bank Limited has delivered a record Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 11.2 billion - 38\% higher than the last year.

In 2022, FBL also completed its full conversion to Islamic and with effect from 01 January 2023 started to work as a full-fledged Islamic Bank under Islamic Banking License issued by the State Bank of Pakistan. Completion of conversion has provided a platform for growth and Inshallah, FBL will be firing on all cylinders in 2023.

## Dear Stakeholders,

## ![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Faysal Bank, it gives me immense pleasure to present our Annual Report and audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. While we look back on the past three decades with pride, we also look forward with optimism to the next three decades and beyond. On behalf of the Board and myself, I would like to voice our sincere thanks and utmost gratitude for your unwavering support to the Bank.

I trust our report will provide you with an in-depth understanding of the Bank as well as the strategies that enabled us to successfully navigate through these challenging times and emerge stronger and more resilient.

75 years of Pakistan and 35 years of FBL presence in Pakistan
The year 2022 marked the Platinum Jubilee of Pakistan's independence. Our journey started 75 years ago with the motto of "Kalma-e-Tayyaba" in which we promised that we will build this country as a prodigious Islamic democratic country of the Muslim world. In the last 75 years, though the country has faced serious economic and socioeconomic problems, it has come a long way being the only Islamic nuclear power state.

FBL takes pride in playing a significant role to establish a viable Islamic financial system in the country. The team of FBL, by converting the bank into a full-fledged Islamic Bank, has made history, which will be considered as a benchmark for Pakistan's
banking industry. FBL conversion has provided a perfect road map to convert Pakistan's financial structure on Islamic system as per the vision put forward by the Government of Pakistan.

Largest conversion of a Conventional Bank into an Islamic Bank It is indeed an incredibly special occasion for us, as FBL celebrates its commendable conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank. Alhamdulilah, with the grace of the All-Mighty, the unwavering vision of the Board, the dedication of the management and the determination of the employees, the Bank has successfully pulled a one-of-a-kind feat: the largest global conversion of a Conventional Bank into an Islamic Bank.

## Looking back at our Financial Performance in 2022

FBL delivered solid financial results for 2022, reporting 38\% increase in net profit to Rs. 11.2 billion. FBL has achieved several milestones including the landmark of Rs. 1.1 trillion in balance sheet footings with deposit market share increasing to $3.5 \%$.

## People are our asset

It goes without saying that our staff is our most valuable asset. They are not only the face of our organization, but also determine our performance. During the year, the Bank continued to invest in their training and development as we firmly believe in developing capabilities from within the organization. The trainings were more emphasized on Islamic Banking courses to upscale the knowledge and reinforce our commitment towards the conversion while also providing career growth to staff.

## Embracing Technology

Adoption of modern technology is critical in today's world, and the increasing rate of digitization is visible in Pakistan across all sectors; and banks are no exceptions. FBL is investing in innovation to ensure that the customers have a seamless banking experience. The Bank's focus on enhancing its digital offerings has led to, not only growth in onboarding of new customers on digital channels, but also increase in transaction volumes. Customers can now fulfill their basic banking needs through WhatsApp Banking without having to login to the mobile banking Application. All these initiatives are part of our commitment to provide best service to customers. We are committed to incorporate modern processes and technologies into our operations and services to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.

## Contribution in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

Corporate Social Responsibility programs have a significant impact on society while leveraging an organization's strengths. FBL has always been committed to support initiatives in the areas of education, professional development of youth, health, and poverty alleviation. We are committed to carrying out our CSR activities for the benefit of society and in 2022 our overall philanthropic contributions were Rs. 88 million.

# Awards for our excellent performance 

FBL has received awards during 2022 from distinguished national and international organizations namely, 'Best Bank of the Year 2021' amongst mid-size banks of the country by Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Society Pakistan; 'Best Islamic Retail Bank in Pakistan 2022' at Islamic Retail Bank Awards (IRBA) organized by Cambridge IFA. All these recognitions and awards are testament to the strategic brilliance of our Board of Directors, Senior Management and the hard work and perseverance of our employees. This shows FBL is on track to achieve the vision of being a premier Islamic Bank in Pakistan and contributing significantly to the economy.

## Positioned for a better future

Considering the current situation, it seems that 2023 is going to be another challenging year. While uncertainties persist, we see opportunity in change, and value in innovating for the future. We are committed to strengthen our market position by focusing on asset quality, innovation in product development, offering personalized services and mobilizing core deposits. During the year we opened 94 branches taking the branch network to 700 and we will continue to open more branches in coming years.

## Heartfelt thanks

With each passing year, we increasingly recognize just how important our stakeholders are to our sustainable growth journey. I would like to thank all our stakeholders for their continued trust and confidence on the Bank.

I would like to express my gratitude to the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities \& Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their continued support and guidance.

I would also like to express my gratitude to our shareholders, members of our Shariah Board and my fellow Board members as well as all members of the Faysal Bank team who worked untiringly to achieve the desired goals of the Bank.

Yours sincerely,

Farooq Rahmatullah Khan Chairman of the Board

## Bank Guarantee

A bank guarantee issued at the request of a customer may be defined as an obligation of the issuing bank to pay a sum of money in the event of non-performance or non-fulfillment of stated obligation by its customer. The guarantee is a separate obligation independent of the principal or the contractual relationship between the creditor and the principal debtor. Bank Guarantees are generally payable on first demand from the beneficiary made within the validity of the guarantee.

FBL offers the facility of issuance of guarantees to its customers generally in the following forms:

## 1. Bid Bonds (GBB)

A Bid Bond substantiates the financial standing of a person submitting a bid. It is issued in connection with submission of a tender for supply of goods or services and its normal characteristic is an undertaking to pay to the beneficiary a fixed amount, generally a small percentage of the total value of the Order, within a stated period on his simple written demand if the applicant withdraws his obligations after acceptance of his bid.

## 2. Performance Guarantee (PBG)

In a performance guarantee the Bank undertakes on behalf of a customer to pay a fixed amount, generally a higher percentage than the Bid Bond, in case the customer fails to discharge his obligations under a particular Order or contract. Upon issuance of Performance Guarantee the Bid Bond issued earlier for the same contract is returned and cancelled.

## 3. Advance Payment Guarantee (GAP)

Contracts, particularly those awarded by government departments, agencies and autonomous bodies such as Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) etc., sometimes provide for an advance payment to be made to contractors for purposes such as mobilizing manpower, material, and equipment and infra-structure facilities on site. In order to obtain this payment, the contractor is required to produce an advance payment bank guarantee. This advance payment is generally deducted proportionately from proceeds paid to the applicant for work done during the contract period.

## 4. Shipping Guarantees (SGS \& SGU)

A shipping guarantee is required by a customer (importer) when the ship carrying the consignment reaches the port of destination and discharges the goods before the Bills of Lading \& other shipping documents are received at importer's bank.

## 5. Financial Guarantee - Others (BGO)

Bank guarantees whose main characteristic is that it is an undertaking by the issuing bank to meet any claim from the beneficiary up to a fixed sum on simple demand stating that the named customer, on whose behalf the Guarantee is issued, has defaulted in timely payment or discharge of his specified liabilities. Other financial guarantees may be issued for the release of Retention money to the contractor before completion of a contract.
6. Financial Guarantee - Financial Institutions Outside Pakistan (FGT)
A Guarantee to Financial Institutions outside Pakistan in the shape of a Bid Bond or Performance Bond issued by the Bank on behalf of customers dealing in exports, an Engineering or consultancy firm etc. to make good a loss incurred by the beneficiary abroad as a result of non-fulfillment of the contract obligations by the applicant within the specified period.
7. Financial Guarantee - Financial Institutions within Pakistan (FGT) A guarantee issued in favor of a financial institution within Pakistan to make good on first simple demand a default of the customer due to non- repayment of the finance extended by the financial institution within the specified period as incorporated in their mutual agreement up to a fixed sum.

## Imports

A Letter of Credit is an obligation taken by a bank (as the issuing bank) on behalf of a buyer of goods \& services (the applicant) to pay a certain sum of money to the seller of such goods \& services (beneficiary) if the documents called for in the letter of credit are presented strictly in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit.

## 3) Import Advance Payment

Advance payment is a payment method in which the price of goods is collected in advance prior to the shipment of the goods which are subject to import and the exporter ships the goods, the payment of which is already made, to the importer later on.

# Competitive Landscape 

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

The large amounts of capital required to setup a bank along with the length of time consumed to establish a significant brand loyalty and the need to adhere to strict regulatory stipulations serve as strong entry barrier for new entrants.

However, the domestic landscape has been evolving to include Fintech participants that are focusing on transactional services and innovative digital solutions for revolutionizing the customer banking experience.

Despite the imminent threat of new entrants and emerging Fintech disruptions, FBL is countering these threats by engaging in the following activities: improving customer-brand relationship that goes beyond the minimum transactional services to retain customer loyalty; investing substantially in digital platforms for improving customer convenience; launching new products and services that cater to a diversified customer base; and adhering with all regulatory guidelines with a view to ensure the highest levels of compliance.

FBL's suppliers primarily comprise of its deposit-holders who are the Bank's key resource for capital and its employees, i.e., human capital.

In an industry scenario with low differentiation, it is easy for the primary deposit-holder group to switch to other banks, tempted by higher rates and better service standards. Further, share of deposits is highly concentrated, which gives them excess bargaining power.

With a view to fund gaps in the Bank's borrowings, The Bank mobilizes debt from other financial institutions, with rates being largely market-driven. Hence, their bargaining power is often considered to be medium
to high. When it comes to the bargaining power of suppliers of labor, individual employees baring major executives have little bargaining power.

FBL has embraced following strategies in order to derive an edge over its supplier relationships:
providing a high degree safety to its capital providers including investors, deposit-holders and other banking partners; a point further re-enforced by Bank's high credit ratings of AA/A1+ for long term and short term respectively;
creating mutually-beneficial solutions across the entire engagement spectrum; and sustaining employee retention focus by offering a challenging, learning, and conductive work environment which is duly complemented by career progression opportunities and market competitive salary and benefit packages.



<!-- Page 29 -->

Some of the largest threats of substitution are not from rival banks but from non-financial competitors.

The industry does not suffer any real threat of substitutes as far as deposits or withdrawals; however, insurances, mutual funds, and fixed income securities are some of the many banking services that are also offered by non-banking companies.

FBL strives to strengthen its suite of products and services. With a renewed focus on bancassurance, investment management and mutual funds.

Faysal Asset Management Limited, a subsidiary of FBL, has acquired Private Fund Management and REIT Management licenses during the year, broadening its realm of business.

It is reasonably easy for retail customers to switch to other banks fully, or even avail part of their service requirements alternatively due to the low switching costs involved, hence shrinking the size of banking engagement. However, their bargaining power stays limited due to the minimal impact on the Bank's bottom line.

The bargaining power of larger groups, corporate clients and high net worth individuals is comparatively greater since the rising competition has increased customers price sensitivity and the loss of sizable accounts and sources of revenue from them can substantially impact bank's profitability.

FBL addresses the issue of customer bargaining power primarily by focusing on clearly directed customer retention and acquisition strategies; customer service standards are being continuously augmented, services are being tailored to suit individual needs, innovative solutions are being devised to make customer experiences more enjoyable, convenient, and hassle-free and market competitive rates are being offered to effectively increase switching costs for customers.

Intensity of competition within the domestic banking sector has grown over the years. Banks have focused on developing a wide range of asset and liability product offerings at competitive rates to reinforce their customer acquisition strategies and attract existing market share.

The relatively low switching cost from one bank to another has further intensified the importance of competition within the industry, especially in the retail and commercial banking spheres.

FBL has initiated following measures with a view to consolidating and further improving its market share:
by distinguishing itself in the marketplace primarily based on its history, experience, and brand image; and staying on the cutting edge of offering customer convenience and low-cost banking solutions.

# Annual Evaluation of the Board of Directors 

In line with the best practices of the corporate governance FBL's Board since 2012 has conducted self-evaluation exercise on an annual basis by engaging Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) as an external facilitator which is the lead on Corporate Governance and has a team of consultants to conduct Board evaluations for companies and banks.

SBP Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors were implemented in August 2016 and subsequently, FBL's Board in compliance thereof has conducted its self-evaluation for the year 2022 by engaging PICG.

The evaluation covered various aspects of the performance of the Board including but not limited to: Board's role, Committees' performance, Training, Strategy, Risk Management, and Board Meetings. The evaluation covered:

- The Board as a whole

The evaluation was carried out using quantitative method based on subjective assessment, and was conducted via questionnaires developed by the consultants in conformance with the State Bank of Pakistan's Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors. The quantitative technique has the advantage of being specific and measurable.

# Remuneration Policy Disclosures 

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The Bank has developed a fair, objective, transparent and sound Remuneration Policy that is aligned with risks and responsibilities of Financial Intermediation.

The scope of Remuneration Policy covers all employees across the Bank who are materially responsible for risk taking or risk controlling activities.

## OBJECTIVES

Following are the main objectives of Remuneration Policy:

- To promote and be consistent with sound and effective risk management and not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk thresholds of the Bank.
- To ensure that the remuneration practice is in line with the Bank's objectives, taking into consideration all major risks that the Bank may face, and promotes and supports long-term sustainable performance.
- To align remuneration with risk appetite and with the conduct expectations of the Bank, regulators and stakeholders; and
- To attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, but also reward those who promote corporate values with incentives correlated to the long-term value generation.


## GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

The Bank's Governance Framework with respect to the aforementioned Guidelines, aims at guaranteeing an appropriate control on remuneration practices, ensuring that decisions are taken with sufficient independence and in an informed way, by such authorities and functions, to which different responsibilities are delegated.

The Board of Directors (BOD) reviews, approves and monitors implementation of the Bank-wide remuneration policy, based on the recommendations of Recruitment, Nomination and Remuneration Committee (RNRC). In addition, the BOD through RNRC, shall review remuneration structure including composition of fixed and variable remuneration of President \& CEO, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Senior Management (excluding Head Internal Audit). Whereas BOD through Board Audit \& Corporate Governance Committee (BACGC) reviews Head Internal Audit's remuneration structure including composition of fixed and variable remuneration.

The RNRC oversees the Bank's remuneration program along with its other approved Terms of Reference. One of its key responsibilities is to approve the list of employees identified as MRTs and MRCs, in accordance with the specified criteria.

The President \& CEO provides support to HR in the development and implementation of Remuneration policy amid review and recommend compensation structures of the Senior Management Team and approve structures for other MRTs/MRCs. The President \& CEO also reviews and recommends to RNRC, malus application for withholding deferred compensation of MRTs/MRCs (including Senior Management), in case of any event resulting in loss to the Bank that is directly attributable to the respective MRT/MRC.

The Business groups and support functions provide adequate support to HR in implementation of this policy.
HR bears primary responsibility for the development, dissemination, coordination and consistent application of the Remuneration policy. Some of its key responsibilities include; Determination of compensation structures, deferrals percentages and periods for all MRTs and MRCs; and Finalization of the deferral pool mechanism through an established Fund and ensuring close coordination with the Trustees of Fund, for deferral compensation management.

## MRT/MRC INCLUSION CRITERIA

The inclusion criteria have been developed in accordance with the Guidelines and applicable best practices, and comprise of two sections, namely, the Qualitative and Quantitative MRT/MRC criteria.

## Qualitative Inclusion Criteria

The following qualitative criteria has been applied for identification of MRTs and MRCs:

- President \& CEO and COO;
- Members of the Senior Management;
- Members of critical Management Committees;
- Heads of critical functions responsible for managing business amid risks and controls; and
- CEO of Faysal Asset Management Limited (a subsidiary of FBL).



<!-- Page 75 -->

# Quantitative Inclusion Criteria 

The Bank has carried out detailed assessment of individuals subjecting the Bank to significant risks. The materiality of significant risks has been determined through the quantitative criteria for each major risk type i.e., i) Credit Risk; ii) Market Risk; iii) Operational Risk; iv) Liquidity Risk; and v) Financial Expenditure Approval Authority.

## ANNUAL MRT/ MRC ASSESSMENTS

HR conducts risk assessments for identification of MRTs and MRCs as per the quantitative and qualitative criteria and present to the President \& CEO for review and recommending to the BACGC/RNRC for onward submission to BOD for approval.

## COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

The Bank offers a compensation structure with a balanced mix of fixed and variable elements, in order to encourage behaviors focused on the achievement of long-term sustainable results, as detailed below: -

## Fixed Remuneration

Fixed remuneration comprises of base salary (including annual increment therein) and role-based fixed allowances, if applicable. Fixed remuneration shall not vary with performance and is payable, in accordance with HR Policies.

## Variable Performance Based Remuneration

Variable remuneration takes into account Bank's performance, Group's performance, business unit/ product's performance and individual's performance. Underachievement of financial performance, taking excessive or undue risks, customer experience, audit/internal controls/compliance issues etc. are generally considered for determining risk-adjusted variable remuneration.

## Other Benefits

Other benefits are awarded on the basis of individual employment contracts and local market practices. These may include staff financing, expense allowances/ reimbursements, life takaful, medical care and relocation allowances etc. These benefits shall not be subject to deferment requirements for MRTs and MRCs.

## PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT OF MRTs AND MRCs

Performance management is a core people management process at FBL which aligns individual performance objectives with the Bank's strategy and priorities, to achieve sustainable and successful performance. Significant points of Performance Management are given below: -

## Risk-adjusted Balanced Scorecards for Performance Evaluation of MRTs/ MRCs

FBL has developed risk-adjusted balanced scorecards for all MRTs and MRCs for their performance measurement, which ensures establishing a correlation between and alignment of risks and rewards. These risk-adjusted balanced scorecards are prepared at individual levels, incorporating various financial, non-financial/ qualitative and risk-adjusting factors.

The performance measurement through risk-adjusted balanced scorecards is also subject to application of an overriding/adjusting factor by the relevant scoring authorities/assessors to account for any circumstances not in control of the individual MRT/MRC whose performance is being assessed.

Further, the assessor may also consider reducing, or zero rising the variable compensation of the individual MRT/MRC, in case the individual does not achieve reasonable minimum/hurdle score in any of the critical factor, category or on an overall basis. In addition to reducing or zero rising variable compensation, disciplinary action may also be initiated in case of significant adverse performance against any risk adjusting factor.

## DEFERRAL MECHANISM

A certain portion of variable compensation of the MRTs and MRCs is subject to mandatory deferrals for a defined period, thus creating alignment between the employees' and stakeholders' interests and reinforcing that compensation is appropriately linked to longer-term sustainable performance.



<!-- Page 76 -->

# Deferral Period \& Percentages 

The deferred amount is withheld for a defined period whereas remaining portion of the variable compensation is paid upfront to the MRT/MRC. The deferred remuneration vests proportionately over the deferral period following the year of variable remuneration award. The deferred portion of the variable remuneration along with the interest accrued shall be paid to the MRT/ MRC on vesting, proportionally through yearly installments, during the deferred period in case no malus triggers are applicable. In case of malus and where accountability has been determined, the entire or certain portion of the deferred remuneration is withheld and not paid to the MRT/MRC on it becoming due.

## Settlement of Deferred Remuneration

As mentioned above, the amount withheld shall be paid proportionately during the deferral period, even if that individual is no more an employee of the Bank. The Bank continues to make payment of the deferred amount proportionately for the remaining deferral period, regardless of whether the employee has resigned, or has been retired or terminated, except in case of malus. However, the entire deferred remuneration shall be paid immediately in the event of death.

IT governance and cybersecurity programs, policies and procedures and industry specific requirements for cybersecurity and strategy in place

The Bank is focused on protecting its most critical assets \& remains vigilant to evolving cyber threats. The Bank has established a comprehensive information security program, comprising of information security policy, detailed standards \& procedures, and an all-inclusive cybersecurity framework. These policies, standards, and frameworks are kept up to date with evolving technology and digital advancements.

## Role of cybersecurity in the board's risk oversight function

The Board has the oversight on cybersecurity matters, whereby key risk items and issues are presented to the Board on periodic basis. Concerns and measures relating to evolving threats is also responded to the Board.

Disclosure that at least one board-level committee is charged with oversight of IT governance and cybersecurity matters and how the board administers its IT risk oversight function related to these risks.

The Board has mandated the cybersecurity oversight responsibilities to the following Board Sub Committees:

# Bank's controls and procedures about an "early warning system" that enables the Bank to identify, assess, address, make timely disclosures and timely communications to the board about cybersecurity risks and incidents. 

The Bank has acquired renowned third-party services that provide insights on the activities happening on Surface, Dark, and Deep Web concerning the Bank. Multiple Threat Intelligence (TI) feeds have also been subscribed by the Bank, which assist the cybersecurity function in developing and recommending appropriate controls against risks on the horizon. Using the information from these early warning systems, the Board is apprised of any imminent threat as well as the countermeasures adopted by the Bank.

Policy related to independent comprehensive security assessment of technology environment, including third party risks and when last such review was carried out.

In compliance with regulatory instructions and leading practices, the Bank has a program for comprehensive security assessments of technology environment and third parties, to ensure the maintenance of cyber resilience and desired risk posture. The assessments are undertaken frequently all around the year to ensure that any changes to the technology environment does not pose a challenge to cybersecurity risk of the Bank.

Resilient contingency and disaster recovery plan in terms of dealing with a possible IT failure or cyber breach and details about Bank's cyber insurance.

The Bank has drawn and implemented a comprehensive resilience mechanism that addresses the continuity of service provision to our customers. At the same time, the Bank undertakes frequent drills of a cyber-attack scenario that keep the pertinent staff alert for a real situation.

Advancement in digital transformation on how the organization has leveraged 4.0 Industrial revolution (RPA, Block Chain, AI, Cloud Computing etc.) to improve transparency, reporting and governance.

Digital transformation is critical in today's business landscape to not only improve operational efficiency but also more so to create processes which aid in better serving the customers. In line with this spirit, amongst other initiatives, Faysal Islami Bank has catered to this through the introduction of AI-based Chatbots. The aim is to create an inclusive solution which is based on machine-learning with the ability to respond back in the natural flow of language, providing quick and accurate answers. By implementing AI-based chatbots, Faysal Bank's customer service will be further improved while reducing the workload on their support teams.

Faysal Islami Bank's Local Digital Account (LDA) is tailored to address the needs of the new age digital customers, who prefer to operate from the comfort of their own environment. FBL's LDA ensures that all security standards are met, through the integrated digital verification methods. Currently this is achieved through, real-time biometric verification and the liveliness check as well. Both these digital verification methods allow the process to be safe, secure and customer friendly. This empowers the idea of self-serve and contactless banking.

Another solution that Faysal Islami Bank is implementing is digital solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Once fully-implemented this will assist in digitizing the manual-intensive process of catering to the requests of SME customers, especially in the case of lending application evaluations. The concept is to go beyond the traditional territories and create seamless experiences across all touch-points. Traffic migration is another important aspect of the digital transformation agenda for Faysal Islami Bank. This refers to the process of routing customer traffic from the traditional and slow channels, onto the digital platform. Initiatives like Digital Kiosk, where cash can be deposited in the Bank, 24/7, without any human-interaction cuts down customers' time and effort of standing in long queues.

In addition to the above FBL is working on expanding the Contactless Payments foot-print, by making it easier for its customers to make retail everyday payments. Currently this high priority project is in motion, whereby the payments will be able to be made just by tapping the phone on the POS terminal, hence eliminating even the need to carry your wallet. The concept behind all digital initiatives for FBL, is to makes life easier for the customers by making payments for seamless and frictionless.

## Education and training efforts of the Bank to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

We continue to develop our internal talent pool and recruit external talent where required to support these critical capabilities. All cybersecurity and IT staff are required to attain training on new technology as well as participate in conferences \& seminars to be aware of new trends.

# Enterprise Resource Planning 

## How it is designed to manage and integrate the functions of core business processes/modules like finance, HR, supply chain and inventory management in a single system

An ERP system consists of software components, or modules, each of which focuses on a distinct business process. ERP is distinguished from standalone applications by its central database that records information from the business transactions and other actions carried out in the modules, and by integration that allows the modules to communicate with each other and with the common database. In Faysal Bank we are using ERP for procure to pay cycle, fixed assets recording and corporate financial reporting.

## Management support in the effective implementation and continuous updation

Faysal Bank management continuously reviews process flows for effective implementation and updates are incorporated as and when required.

## Details about user training of ERP software

Training employees to use a ERP system effectively, is critical to the success of any implementation or upgrade project. During upgrade phase FBL has conducted user training session to ensures the efficient and effective use of the ERP system by the employees. Training gives users the opportunity to understand their work's relation to other functional areas.

## How the company manages risks or control risk factors on ERP projects

The impact of risks on project outcome are determined with the involvement of the representatives of both project team as well as the ERP implementation partner. They devised mitigating strategies for each risk through brainstorming, which are conducted by the project manager. The project manager has overall responsibility for managing all risks and discussing closing actions, due dates, priorities and risk impacts to ensure that risks are being actively managed. High probability and high impact risks are escalated to be analyzed and resolved.

## How the company assesses system security, access to sensitive data and segregation of duties

Segregation of Duties are achieved by restricting user access to conflicting activities within the application. It is essential to rely on a reliable information system and to ensure security of the data. In FBL user management and roles assignment are managed by an independent team. Any activity with respect to user management is duly approved by concerned authority. In FBL Oracle E Business Suite is operated on private network to prevent access of financial data from outside.

## External Search Consultancy for Directors selection

Non-Executive Directors are appointed through election of Directors at the AGM. The last election took place in 2020. No external search consultancy was required for appointment of the Chairman or Non-Executive Directors, at the time of election.

# Corporate Social Responsibility 

The end of year 2022 marked an unprecedented achievement for Faysal Bank, that is completing its conversion to an Islamic bank. Since its inception, Faysal Bank has acknowledged the need of giving back to the society hence the corporate social responsibility footprint has been increasing each year.

This year Bank's CSR Policy was updated considering SDGs and ISO 26000 guidelines. This reinforced Faysal Bank's resolve to stay current with the advancement of the banking landscape across the country. As per the guidance of the Board, Faysal Bank has supported initiatives and institutions within the education sector, health sector and specific programs that would have greater social impact and enhance financial inclusion. To ensure effective governance of CSR spending and monitoring an accreditation from Pakistan Center for Philanthropy was also received this year.

To meet its CSR objectives Faysal Bank partnered with leading charitable organizations by strengthening their efforts across Pakistan. The key highlights of CSR initiatives of 2022 include:

- Supporting Diversity, Equity \& Inclusion (DEI)
- Making education and healthcare accessible
- Women empowerment
- Flood relief efforts

Faysal Bank donated a total of PKR 74,627,292 in 2022 through Waqf Faisal and distributed it among areas requiring utmost support.

## Education Assistance:

Faysal Bank supported educational institutions from primary to the higher education levels. The core purpose has been to impart quality education to students irrespective of their ability to afford the school or university fee. Beside this FBL has resolved to support early learning programs especially for children that require special attention. These are high impact initiatives yet have not received desired level of attention such as centers for children with down syndrome.

To nurture the growing Islamic banking sector within Pakistan, Faysal Bank has partnered with universities and institutes that offer Islamic courses. By providing need-based scholarships for students, research funding and training scholars Faysal Bank played an important role in cultivating work force that has fair understanding of Islamic Finance. Faysal Bank worked with several educational institutes to support deserving students by sponsoring their educational expenses for primary education, higher education, professional education and vocational training.

Following are the leading institutions that Faysal Bank partnered with for this initiative:

- Centre of Islamic Economics
- Karachi Down Syndrome Program
- Centre of Excellence in Islamic Finance (IM Sciences)
- University of Peshawar


## Social Upliftment:

The grass root level training of the increasing workforce is an integral part of poverty alleviation; it leads to the reduction in unemployment rate and creates sustainable social development. Therefore around 34\% of the CSR budget has been spent on initiatives pertaining to the social upliftment. In line with this FBL works with multiple entities covering diverse geographies along with a long-term partnership with Special Olympics Pakistan (SOP) and has supported activities arranged for differently abled persons. Faysal Bank has played its part in paving way for athletes across from Pakistan to take part in the National Games through SOP. Faysal Bank went a step further in motivating athletes of SOP by inviting them to the corporate event on Pakistan's Independence Day. Several young children participated in this event with passion to mark 75th Independence Day. They took part in the flag hoisting ceremony and mingled with the senior leadership of the Bank.

Following are the leading institutions that Faysal Bank partnered with for this initiative:

- Special Olympics Pakistan
- Saylani Welfare Int. Trust
- Bestway Foundation
- Family Welfare Society


## Healthcare:

Access to the healthcare facilities for financially disadvantaged members of Pakistani society remains a paramount challenge. Faysal Bank realizes this challenge hence several initiatives have been supported by the Bank to help needy patients in meeting their medical expenses. With support received from FBL many poor patients have been able to receive access to quality healthcare for their complex and critical illnesses. In 2022 Faysal Bank allocated 26\% of its CSR spend towards social welfare initiatives to play its part in setting up a society as per the Islamic principles. Following are the leading institutions that Faysal Bank partnered with for this initiative:

- Indus Hospital
- Memon Medical Institute Hospital
- Patients' Aid Foundation
- Child Health and Growth Welfare
- Lahore Businessmen Association for Rehabilitation of the Disabled
- Shalamar institute of Health Sciences

## Other Initiatives:

## Social \& Environmental Responsibility Policy

The Bank has created a comprehensive "Green Banking Policy". The goal of this policy is to instill environmental awareness among the Bank's personnel and client base.

- Extending financing facilities to customers based on an Environmental Risk Management framework is part of the policy.
- Guidelines for the Bank's adoption of environmentally friendly policies and procedures.
- Raising customer knowledge of the necessity of environmentally responsible behaviors.


## Environmental Risk Management

Faysal Bank has developed an Environmental Risk Management framework that includes the implementation of the Environmental Risk Rating (ERR) model to assess the impact of borrowing relationships on the environment in order to conduct risk categorization of our borrowing customers and gauge environmental impact of lending operations.

## Environmental Consciousness

To promote environmental awareness, a training module has been included in the new employee orientation package that outlines the concept of green banking, the fundamental pillars of Faysal Bank's green banking policy, and raises knowledge of environmental challenges. Employees who join Faysal Bank are subjected to regular training. Additionally, screensavers are used on a regular basis to emphasize the message of energy efficiency and conservation.

## Building Design \& Operations

While shortlisting vendors/equipment and maintenance tasks, energy efficiency is kept at the forefront of decision-making. The new equipment being purchased for the branches is all energy star certified. To reduce energy consumption and efficiency, the Bank is aiming to replace traditional lights with LED technology, as well as traditional air conditioners with inverters. Furthermore, a comprehensive plan is being implemented to certify all bank cars and generators for pollution control, which will help to reduce carbon emissions.

## Paperless Operations

Faysal Bank is aggressively raising awareness about Green Banking activities such as digital banking and e-statement subscriptions. Customers are continually encouraged to switch to paperless transactions through regular trainings for branch personnel, contact centre representatives, and other teams.

# Sensitivity Analysis due to Foreign Currency Fluctuations 

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Bank undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP. Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank's approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

For details about the Bank's foreign exchange risk refer note 44.2.2 to the accompanying unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

## Methods and assumptions used in compiling the indicators

The Bank uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure success of initiatives as well as routine operational activities.

FBL identifies KPIs which effectively reflect the Bank's performance. The Bank analyses all traditional financial and profitability ratios together with an analysis of its market positioning, competitors and general market conditions. Financial ratios include growth in deposits and advances, non-performing loans ratio and provision coverage, while profitability ratios include net margin ratio, non-markup income to total income, cost to income ratio, return on assets, return on equity and earnings per share.

## Share Price Sensitivity Analysis

## Share Price Sensitivity Analysis

Below is a list of some key factors that can influence the share price of Faysal Bank Limited. The list is not exhaustive and intends to cover the major areas:

## - Regulatory / Policy Changes

Any regulatory or policy changes that directly impact the overall banking landscape along with cost and / or revenue drivers are likely to exert a significant influence on the Bank's stock price. For example, any change in monetary policy rate has a direct impact on yields of government securities, spreads made on advances and funding costs; and in turn materially impact profitability and the share price as well. Similarly, any hike in the minimum rate of return on deposits will result in compression in net interest margins earned and can negatively impact the earning and correspondingly the share price of the scrip.

## - Investor and Market Sentiment

Market sentiment is often subjective which makes it difficult to quantify but a change in sentiments due to the investment climate in general or the stock market in particular can have an impact on the Bank's share price as well. Such a sentiment driven impact on the share price can occur even in the absence of any fundamental development or change in the Bank's business case.

## - Change in Macro Environment

Political stability and controlled law \& order situation is a pre-requisite for any economic development. Any changes in the macro environment, including inflation and / or currency devaluation could see the stock price of the Bank move alongside as market preempts such developments and extrapolates their impact on policy / regulatory changes in the Bank's share price.

| Share Price as of December 31, 2022 | Rs. 25.83 |
| :-- | :-- |
| High Price | Rs. 31.94 |
| Low Price | Rs. 19.95 |
| Average Volume | $1,009,586$ |
| No. of Trading Days | 238 |

# Business Rationale for Major Capital Expenditure/Projects 

Faysal Bank realizes the importance of capital expenditure and in view of this has adopted in-depth evaluation procedures to assess all types of capital expenditure requirements before obtaining final endorsements from the Board.

During the year, the bank's capital expenditure amounted to over Rs. 2.6 billion and was primarily directed towards acquisition of Land \& Building, business expansion, renovation, improvement of digital framework and strengthening of IT infrastructure. A detailed disclosure of fixed asset is given in the financial statements.

## Capital expenditures planned for next year

The Bank has budgeted capital expenditure of Rs. 10.6 billion for the next year. This would primarily be invested in expanding our branch network acquisition of properties, continuous improvement in our IT platforms, safeguarding our existing infrastructure / relationships from growing threats on cyber security front along with routine upgrades and replacements to ensure smooth operations.

# Forward Looking Statement 

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as "anticipate," "target," "expect," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "goal," "believe," or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide Faysal Bank's current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Bank's control. FBL's actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, among many others below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

- Local, regional and global business, economic and political conditions and geopolitical events;
- Changes in laws and regulatory requirements, including capital and liquidity requirements affecting the Bank's business, and the ability of the Bank to address those requirements;
- Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending or savings behavior; and
- Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, including health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, pandemics or outbreaks of hostilities, or the effects of climate change, and the Bank's ability to deal effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Bank speak only as of the date they are made, and Faysal Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Bank may make in any subsequent Quarterly Reports, or other Briefings.

## 2023 - A fresh start as a 100\% Islamic Bank

## FBL's Corporate Strategic Plan focuses on:

## Being the Leading Islamic Bank in Pakistan

The Bank aims the provision of exceptional services to its customers across all touchpoints through empowered trained staff and innovative digital channels, while ensuring full compliance with applicable regulatory and Shariah standards and guidelines. It will also continue to invest in its workforce and foster a culture that encourages its core values.

## Growth

The Bank expects to continue the momentum gained in 2021 \& 2022 and to register double digit growth in terms of profitability in 2023. The Bank aspires to increase its outreach through physical branch network ( 55 new branches) and digital solutions (ATMs, CDMs). To ensure sustainable achievement of strategic objectives FBL aims to focus on deposit growth and grow market share.

## Digital Banking

With a vision to promote and establish Faysal Bank as the bank of first choice the Digital Banking Team anticipates graduating digital business into a full-fledged distribution channel. The goal is to continuously enhance the digital eco-system of the Bank to support transaction banking business in development of new customer-centric capabilities.

## Sources of Information and Assumptions Used in the Forward-looking Statement

Major factors underlying these Forward Looking Statements include:

- Discount rate / Monetary Policy: Based on different assessment parameters, the State Bank of Pakistan can change the monetary policy rate. Any decrease in the discount rate will result in lower net interest income and reduce the profitability of the Bank. Impact of 1\% change in interest rate is around Rs. 1.3 billion on profit and loss account of the Bank.
- Inflation: Inflation is considered as a key determinant of policy rate change. Any uptick in the inflation statistics will have a material impact on the monetary policy rate along with other drivers. With higher discount rates, the Banks will be able to invest in high yielding assets, thus resulting in increased profitability.



<!-- Page 111 -->

- Political Stability \& Law and order situation: Political stability and controlled law \& order situation is a pre-requisite for any economic development. This, in turn, reposes investor confidence Pakistan, making our corporates a potential investment opportunity. However, any act of terrorism or political instability can negatively impact the economy /equity market, thus resulting in decreased profitability.
- Corporate Tax rate: Any increase in corporate tax rate will adversely impact the profitability of the Bank.

Risk and Opportunity

<!-- Page 126 -->

# Risk and Opportunity Report 

Risk and opportunity management is one of the key activities managed by the Bank through a Board approved Integrated Risk Management framework. All major risks are monitored regularly by various management committees such as Country Credit Committee (CCC), Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Investment Committee (IC), IT Steering Committee (ITSC) and Compliance \& Fraud Risk Committee (C\&FRC) within their respective areas.

## Key Risks

Banks are generally exposed to multiple risks emanating from various internal \& external factors - including but not limited to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, capital adequacy risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, legal \& regulatory risk, compliance risk, country risk, reputational risk, strategic risk and environmental risk. With Faysal Bank's conversion into a full-fledged Islamic Bank. Shariah non-compliance risk is also a significant risk, emanating from routine operations of the Bank.

The year 2022 remained challenging on a global as well as domestic front. International political divide exacerbated global energy and commodity crises which negatively impacted Pakistan's balance of payment position. Local landscape was further marred by political uncertainty, delays in IMF program, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, inflationary commodity cycle and an unprecedented natural calamity which inundated large parts of Pakistan causing estimated damages in the vicinity of USD 40 bln. These factors have negatively impacted all major economic indicators for the year 2022.

Despite these challenges, Faysal Bank continued to grow by increasing its deposit and financing base along with the growth of its branch network nationwide. This growth is also significant given the fact that in 2022, the Bank was able to complete its transformation from a conventional bank to a full-fledged Islamic bank - acknowledged by the Islamic International Rating Agency (IIRA) as the largest conversion globally.

While pursuing growth during the last year, focus remained on pro-active monitoring of assets through regular rapid portfolio reviews, effective implementation of capital \& liquidity management tools, taking measures to address Shariah non-compliance risks, capacity building for Islamic conversion, product development and improving service quality.

Going forward, management of the Balance of Payment, fiscal discipline, rising inflation and general elections will remain key determinants for Pakistan's economy and banking sector. Challenging economic situation is expected to result in lower GDP and limited growth in Large Scale Manufacturing. This may lead to higher default risk and weaker demand for fresh private sector financing.

# Report of Shariah Board 

## For the year ending December 31, 2022

![img-71.jpeg](img-71.jpeg)

Faysal Bank Limited ("the Bank") has completed its journey of conversion into a full-fledged Islamic bank while completing another year of successful operations of Islamic Banking. The Shariah Board ("SB") congratulates all stakeholders of the Bank and appreciates the commitment and efforts of Board of Directors ("BoD"), Executive management and entire Bank staff towards the complete transformation of the Bank into a full-fledged Islamic Bank.

During the year, the Shariah Board held four meetings to consider, deliberate, decide and supervise various Shariah related affairs of the Bank including review of various existing and new products, transactions, processes, policies, standard operating procedures and agreements. In compliance with Shariah Governance Framework, the Shariah Board ("SB") also met with Board of Directors ("BoD") twice this year to have a detailed briefing on Shariah compliance environment.

Following are the key developments for the year 2022:

## Conversion of Bank's portfolio

During the year, the Bank converted all remaining branches, across the country, from Conventional to Islamic banking, besides opening 94 new Islamic branches elevating the total number of Islamic branch network to 700 branches.

Although the Bank has been converted into a full-fledged Islamic bank, it has some residual conventional portfolio which has been ring-fenced and Shariah guidelines have been issued for the treatment of such portfolio.

## Product Development and Management

Under the guidance of SB, Product Development \& Management has worked for the enrichment of its product menu. During the period under review, various structures were approved to facilitate the conversion process. Moreover, Istisna \& Tijarah products were optimized to enhance Shariah compliance of these products.

On liability side, the Bank introduced Faysal Islami Amal Women Account on Mudarabah basis. The Bank also executed Open Market Operation (OMO) and Mudarabah Financing Facility (MFF) transactions, to manage its liquidity requirements effectively, which were earlier introduced by SBP.

## Shariah Structuring of Investment Banking Transactions

Shariah Board reviewed and approved 04 Islamic IBG transactions whereby the Bank's Shariah Board served as the Shariah Advisor of the transaction. These transactions were primarily structured on Shirkat-ul-Milk (Diminishing Musharakah) basis to achieve various financing purposes like Capital expenditure, project finance, etc.

## Shariah Compliance Department

To ensure the compliance of regulatory and SB's guidelines, under the guidance of RSBM / SB, SCD reviewed Financial Institutions Group, Treasury, Corporate and Investment Banking, SME/Commercial, Human Resources (staff financing side), Consumer financing (secured and unsecured) along with more than 125 Islamic branches across different regions of the bank. Moreover, SCD also reviewed the Pool management \& Profit distribution mechanism on monthly basis.

During this period, all Bank-wide policies and procedures (new and renew) presented, were reviewed by SCD and approved by Shariah Board.

During the year, SCD obtained SB approvals on more than 800 customized process flows of various Islamic financing structures including Murabaha, Istisna, Tijarah, Running Musharakah, Diminishing Musharakah Salam, Bai Muajjal, etc. including that of SBP schemes like Islamic Export Re-Finance (IERF), Islamic long Term Financing Facility (ILTFF) and Islamic Finance for Renewable Energy (IFRE) etc.

# Shariah Audits 

Internal \& external Shariah Audits were undertaken as per the requirement of Shariah Governance Framework. Internal Shariah Audit Unit carried out Shariah audits during the period for following functions i.e. SME and Commercial Banking, Islamic Branch Banking, Consumer financing - Noor Card, Trade Business and Services, Liability products, and on quarterly basis Profit distribution and Pool Management calculations. Further, external Shariah audit was also carried out covering all relevant functions of Islamic Banking.

## Charity

In compliance with SBP guidelines, the Bank has formalized its Shariah Non-Compliance Risk Management Framework accordingly. The opening balance of the charity funds was PKR 42.956 Mn and during the year an amount of PKR 188.806 Mn was recovered from the customers in lieu of delayed payments, as the charity funds are kept under Mudarabah based accounts before the Bank resulting in the Mudarabah profit of PKR 5.256 Mn which was also credited into the charity fund's account.

Additionally, during internal Shariah reviews and internal Shariah audits conducted by SCD and ISAU, an amount of PKR 8.713 Mn was credited into Charity Fund due to Shariah non-compliance issues as declared by the SB.

During this period, an amount of PKR 46.053 Mn was distributed to various charitable organizations. Details are available on note 4 of Annexure 2.

## Capacity building and Awareness Sessions

Capacity building and awareness sessions play a pivotal role for the growth of the Islamic banking industry. SB acknowledge the efforts of Management and Learning and Development ("L\&D") to arrange various Islamic banking training programs and awareness sessions.

Members of Shariah Board and renowned Shariah Scholars conducted various Islamic finance training and awareness sessions for Bank's staff across the country. During the year, L\&D organized more than 140 training sessions across the country to educate the staff on Islamic banking wherein more than 7500 employees were trained under various online and classroom training programs. Members of Shariah Board, SCD and product teams were actively engaged with L\&D to facilitate the same. Further, specialized training program for Trade finance and Risk Management was also developed and organized. Besides, in-house training programs, L\&D also nominated staff for external trainings offered by LUMS for Leadership Development Program and sponsored Certified Shariah Adviser and Auditor (CSAA) certifications from Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions ("AAOIFI") Bahrain.

Members of Shariah Board, IBD and SCD also played a pivotal role in the capacity building of the staff wherein they facilitated through improvement of training material as well as conducted various training sessions on Shariah concepts, Islamic products and services.

## Promotion and Marketing of Islamic banking products \& services

Bank has converted into a full-fledged Islamic bank and has reinforced its renewed corporate identity brand. Accordingly, during this period, various marketing promotional materials including printed and electronic brochures, TVCs were reviewed and approved by the SB.

## Opinion of Shariah Board

While the Board of Directors and Executive Management are solely responsible to ensure that the operations of Faysal Bank Limited are conducted in a manner that comply with Shariah principles at all times, we are required to submit a report on the overall Shariah compliance environment of Faysal Bank Limited.



<!-- Page 138 -->

To form our opinion as expressed in this report, the Shariah Compliance Department of the Bank carried out reviews, on sampling basis, of each class of transactions, the relevant documentation and process flows. Further, we have also reviewed the reports of the internal Shariah audit and external Shariah audit.

Based on above, we are of the view that:

1. The Islamic Banking Division of the Bank by and large complied with the Shariah rules and principles in the light of resolutions / Fatawa, rulings and guidelines issued by the SB.
2. During review, matters requiring corrective measure have been noted and were resolved by the Management or ensured to be rectified in future. Subject to the foregoing, in our opinion, the affairs of the Islamic Banking Division have been carried out in accordance with the directives, regulations, instructions and guidelines related to Shariah compliance issued by the SBP.
3. The Bank has a comprehensive mechanism in place to ensure Shariah compliance in their overall operations.
4. Bank has a well-defined system in place in the form of Shariah Compliance Review and Internal Shariah Audit to ensure that the earnings realized from sources or means prohibited by Shariah are credited to charity account and properly utilized for charitable purposes.
5. The allocation of funds, profit and loss distribution and pool management is generally in accordance with Shariah Rules \& Principles and Pool Management guidelines of SBP.
6. Learning and development unit of the Bank is actively pursuing the training and development of human capital on Islamic Banking \& Finance through various training programs to enhance the awareness of staff, Management and BOD for the products and processes of the Bank and importance of Shariah compliance.
7. Shariah Board was provided unhindered access of all required information along with adequate resources, enabling it to discharge its duties effectively.

# Recommendations from Shariah Board 

Based on the above, the efforts of Management and other support functions toward conversion of the Bank are appreciated. However, we recommend that the conventional residual ring-fenced portfolio should be cleansed on best-effort basis.

Allah Subhanahu-wa-Taa'la knows the Best

# شریف بورڈ ریورٹ

## برائے انتظام پذیر سال 31 دسمبر 2022

### بسم اللہ الرحمن الرحیم

الحمدلله رب العالمین والصلوة والسلام على خاتم الأنبياء والمرسلین محمد المصطفی الصادق اللعین وعلى آله وصحابه اجمعین

الحمدلله اللعین ویک لملک (ویک) نے اسلامی بیکاری کے کامیاب آپریشن کا ایک اور سال عمل کرتے ہوئے ایک نکل اسلامی ویک کی طرف منتقل ہونے کا سفر نکل کر لیا ہے۔ شریف بورڈ (SB) ویک کے تمام اسٹیک ہولڈرز کو مبارک یاد پیش کرتا ہے اور نکل اسلامی ویک میں منتقل کے لیے بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹر (BoD) کے عزم اور کوششوں کو سرایتا ہے۔

سال کے دوران شریف بورڈ نے ویک کے مختلف شرعی امور پر غورہ فکر اور ان کی تحرائی کے لیے چار اجلاس منعقد کیے جن میں متعدد موجودہ اور نئی مصنوعات، معاملات، اعمال، پالیسیوں، آپریشن کے معیاری طریقہ کار اور معاہدوں کا جائزہ لیا گیا۔ اس سال شریف بورڈ (SB"") نے شریف گورنمن فراہم ورک کے تحت بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹر (BoD") سے دوبارہ ملاقات کی جس میں شریف کمپلائنس کے ماحول کے بارے میں تفصیل سے آگاہ کیا گیا۔

سال 2022 کی اہم پیش رفت درج ذیل ہیں:

### ویک کے پورٹ فولیو کی تبدیلی

سال کے دوران، ویک نے ملک بھر میں باقی ماندہ تمام برائچوں کو کنوننکل سے اسلاک بیٹینگ میں تبدیلی کر دیا، اس کے علاوہ 94 نئی اسلامی برائچیں کھولیں جس سے اسلامی برائچ نیٹ ورک کی مجموعی تعداد کو 700 برائچز کی سیکھٹک بلند کر دیا۔

اگرچہ ویک کو ایک نکل اسلامی ویک میں تبدیلی کر دیا گیا ہے، لیکن اس کے پاس کچھ ایسا کنوننکل پورٹ فولیو باقی ہے جس کی حد بند ی کر کے اس پورٹ فولیو کے بارے میں شرعی حوالے سے ہدایات جاری کی گئی ہیں۔

### پروڈکٹ ڈیوپلیپمنٹ و شیمیمینٹ

شریف بورڈ کی رہنمائی میں پروڈکٹ ڈوپلیپمنٹ و شیمینٹ (سیارٹمنٹ) نے اپنی پروڈکٹس کی فہرست میں اضافہ کے لیے پیش رفت کی ہے۔ مذکورہ بالا مدت کے دوران اسلامی بیکاری کی طرف منتقل کے عمل کو آسان بنانے کے لیے متعدد اسٹرکیٹرز کی منظوری دی گئی۔ مزید برآں، استعناک اور تنیارہ پروڈکٹس کے طریقہ کار میں مزید بہتری لائی گئی ہے۔

لائیں بندی سائڈ پر ویک نے مضارب پر مبنی "الیمل اسلاک مل خواتین اکاؤنٹ" کو جھارف کر دیا ہے۔ ویک نے اپنی ٹیکویڈیٹی کے نٹلاضوں کو مؤثر طریقے سے منظم کرنے کے لیے اوپن مارکیٹ آپریشن (OMO) اور مضارب فٹائسٹک فیسٹیلی (MFF) ٹرانز بیشتر کو بھی انجام دیا ہے جو کہ کچھ عرصے سے SBP کی طرف سے جھارف کروائی گئی ہیں۔

انویسٹ بیکننگ کے عقود کی شریرہ اسٹر کیمرنگ

شریرہ بورڈ نے 04 اسلای IBG عقود کا جائزہ لیا اور ان کی منظوری دی جس میں ویک کے شریرہ بورڈ نے ان ٹرائز کیشنز عقود کے شریرہ ایڈوائز ر کی خدمات انجام دیں۔ ان عقود کو
بنیادی طور پر مختلف تحولی مقاصد جیسے کہ کمپیوٹر ایکسپینڈر چر، پر انہیٹ فٹنس وغیرہ کے حصول کے لیے شرکتہ الفک (شرکت متاقھے) کی بنیاد پر تشکیل دیا گیا تھا۔

شعبہ شریرہ کمپلائنس

ریگولینری اور شریرہ بورڈ کی ہدایات پر عمل دے مد کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے، SB/RSBM کی رہنمائی میں، شریرہ کمپلائنس ڈیپارٹمنٹ نے فائنٹل انسٹیبوئن گروپ، ٹریٹری،
کادپوریٹ اور انویسٹمنٹ بیکننگ، ایس ایم/ای /کمرشل، بیومن رنسور سسوز (اسٹاف فٹنسنگ سائیڈ) کنزیومر فٹنسنگ (سیک بورڈ اور ان سیکیورڈ) کا جائزہ لیا، ساتھ ہی ساتھ مختلف
علاقوں میں ویک کی 125 سے زائد اسلامی برا لچڑ کا بھی جائزہ لیا۔ مزید یہ کہ SCD نے مابند بنیادوں پر پول چیمنٹ اور منافع کی تقسیم کے طریقہ کار کا بھی جائزہ لیا۔

اس دوران، SCD نے ویک کی تمام پالیسیوں اور طریقہ کار (تنی اور تجدید شدہ) کا بھی جائزہ لیا اور شریرہ بورڈ نے ان کی منظوری دی۔

دوران سال SCD نے 800 سے زائد حصار فین کے لحاظ سے مخصوص پر اسس فلوئہ کی منظوری حاصل کی جو کہ متعدد اسلائک طریقہ بائے تحویل جیسے مضاربہ، استعمال
، تجارہ، رائک مشار کہ، شرکت متاقھے، سلم، بیچ مٹوعل وغیرہ پر مشتمل ہونے کے ساتھ SBP کی اسکیمرز جیسے کہ اسلائک ایگسپورٹ ری سفئنس (IERF) اسلائک لاٹک ٹرم
فٹنسنگ (ILTFF) اور ریٹو اینٹل انرٹی کے لیے اسلامی فٹنس (IFRE) وغیرہ پر مشتمل ہیں۔

شریرہ آئنس

شریرہ گورنمن فریم بورک کے تقاضوں کے مطابق انٹر فل اور ایکسر کل شریرہ آئٹ کو انجام دیا گیا۔ انٹر فل شریرہ آئٹ یونٹ نے اس مدت کے دوران درج ذیل شعبوں کے لیے

رقم 42.956 فین روپے تھی اور دوران سال ادا کیلی میں تاثیر کی وجہ سے کسٹر ز سے 188.806 فین روپے، وصول کیے گئے۔ کیونکہ چیریٹی فنڈ ز کو ویک کے پاس مضاربہ
پر مبنی اکاؤنٹس میں رکھا جاتا ہے اس لیے مضاربہ سے حاصل شدہ 5.256 فین روپے کا کلم بھی چیریٹی فنڈز کے اکاؤنٹ میں منتقل کیا گیا۔

علاوہ ازیں SCD اور ISAU کے جائزوں اور انٹر فل شریرہ آئٹ کے دوران 8.713 فین روپے چیریٹی فنڈ میں منتقل کیے گئے جو کہ شریعت کے اصولوں سے عدم مطابقت
کی وجہ سے تھا جس کی SB کی طرف سے وضاحت کی گئی۔ اس دوران 46.053 فین کی رقم مختلف ٹیرائی اداروں میں تقسیم کی گئی۔ جنگی تنسیلات تغییر 2 کے ٹوٹ 4 پر
دستیاب ہیں۔

استعداد کار میں اضافہ اور آگاہی کے اجلاس

اسلامی بینکاری کی صنعت کی ترقی میں صلاحیتوں کا ارغہ اور آگاہی اجلاس ایک اہم کردار ادا کرتے ہیں۔ SB اسلامی بینکننگ ٹریننگ کے مختلف پروگرامز اور آگاہی سیشنز کا اہتمام
کرنے پر انتظامیہ اور لرٹنگ اینڈ ڈیوبلپمنٹ ("L&D") کی خدمات کا اصتراف کر تا ہے۔

شریحہ بورڈ کے اراکین اور معروف شریحہ اسکالرز نے ملک گیر سطح پر ویک کے عملے کے لیے اسلامی فنٹس کی متعدد ٹریننگ اور آگاہی سیشنز کا انعقاد کیا۔ دوران سال L&D نے عملے

مارکیٹنگ پر ومو شمل مواد بشمول پرت شدہ اور انکبٹر اٹک بروشرز، TVCs کا جائزہ لیا گیا اور SB کی طرف سے منظوری دی گئی۔

شریحہ بورڈ کی رائے

چونکہ بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹر ز اور ایگزینیم میٹمنٹ مکمل طور سے اس امر کو یقینی بنانے کے ذمہ دار ہیں کہ فیصل ویک لمبیٹڈ کے امور کی انجام دہی اس طرح کی جائے جو جمہ وقت شریعت کے
اصولوں سے ہم آہنگ ہو، اس لئے ہم سے فیصل ویک لمبیٹڈ کے مجموعی مامول کے شریعت سے ہم آہنگ ہونے پر ایک رپورٹ پیش کرنے کا تقاضہ کیا جاتا ہے۔ جیسا کہ اس رپورٹ
سے واضح ہے، ہماری رائے یہ ہے کہ ویک کے شعبہ شریحہ کہلا جنس نے نمونہ جاتی بنیاد پر ہر طرح کے معاملات، متعلقہ دستاویزات اور عملہ ڈھ کے طریقہ کار کا جائزہ لیا ہے۔ مزید یہ
کہ ہم انٹر فل شریحہ آڈٹ اور ایکشرغل شریحہ آڈٹ کی رپورٹس کا تجربہ کر چکے ہیں۔

مندرجہ بالابتیار پر ہمار انقلہ نظر یہ ہے کہ:

1. ویک کے اسلائک بینکننگ ڈویژن کے جملہ امور کو شریحہ بورڈ کی طرف سے جاری کردہ قرار دادوں، قباوی جات، ہدایات و احکامات کی روشنی میں شریعت کے اصول
و ضوابط کے مطابق انجام دیا گیا ہے۔

2. جائزہ کے دوران کسی بھی قابلِ ضجج مسئلہ کو ٹوٹ کیا گیا اور بذریعہ میٹمنٹ اس کو حل کیا گیا یا مستقبل میں اس کی ضجج کو یقینی بنایا گیا ہے۔ مالکل سے مربوط ہماری رائے میں
اسلائک بینکننگ ڈویژن کے امور کو شریحہ کہلا جنس سے متعلق اسٹیٹ ویک پاکستان کی طرف سے جاری کردہ قرار دادوں، اصولوں، احکامات و ہدایات کے مطابق انجام دیا
گیا ہے۔

5. فنڈز کی تعیین، لیلع و نقصان کی تقسیم اور پول مینیمنٹ، شریعت کے اصول و ضوابط اور SBP کی پول مینیمنٹ سے متعلق ہدایات کے مطابق ہوئی ہے۔

6. ویگ کا ارتکالینڈ ڈیوینیمنٹ یونٹ متعدد ترتیبی پروگرامز کے ذریعہ اسلامی ہیکاری دمائیاٹ پر انسانی سرمایہ کی تربیت اور ترقی کے لئے سرگرم عمل ہے تاکہ ویگ کی
پروڈ کنس و طریقہ کار اور شریرہ کہہا ئنس کی اہمیت پر عملے، مینیمنٹ اور BoD کی آگاہی میں اضافہ کیا جائے۔

7. شریرہ بورڈ کو اپنی ذمہ داریوں سے بخوبی عہد و بر آں ہونے کے قابل بنانے کے لئے تمام مطلوبہ معلومات تک ہزار کاوٹ رسائی اور مناسب وسائل مہیا کئے گئے ہیں۔

شریرہ بورڈ کی سفارش

مندرجہ بالاتصیلات کی بنیاد پر ، ویگ کی اسلامی ہیکاری کی طرف منتقل کے لیے انتظامیہ اور دیگر شعبہ جات کی خدمات قابل ستائش ہیں۔ تاہم ہمارا مشورہ ہے کہ باقی ماندہ کنونفل حد
بندی والے پورٹ فولیو کی تکمیل میں پوری کو کشش صرف کی جائے۔

# Statement On Internal Controls 

This statement is presented to comply with the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued vide BSD Circular No. 07 dated May 27, 2004 "Guidelines on Internal Controls" and OSED Circular No. 01 dated February 07, 2014 "Instructions on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)".

The Management of Faysal Bank Limited is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate and effective internal control system in the Bank. In this context, the Management has designed the Bank's Internal Control Program to provide reasonable assurance on the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness of the operations and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Although, the Internal Control Program is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure, circumvention and overriding of controls. Even an effective internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system's objective will be achieved.

Policies and procedures encompassing various business and operational areas are in place, updated and communicated across all pertinent levels of the organization. The policies are approved by the Bank's Board of Directors (BoD) and the procedures are approved by the Senior Management. The Bank's internal audit function carries out monitoring of compliance with these policies and procedures and regularly apprises the Management as well as the BoD through Board's Audit and Corporate Governance Committee, accordingly.

The Management of the Bank has instituted an Internal Control and Monitoring Unit (ICMU) - Compliance Function for the conduct of on-site and off-site reviews of the processes related to Support Functions as well as the branches. Accordingly, ICMU monitors and identifies gaps in the day-to-day operations and ensures prompt corrective actions. Further, ICMU ensures compliance and implementation of policies and procedures duly approved by the BoD and Senior Management, respectively, to maintain a suitable control environment. Moreover, the Management takes remedial measures to address the gaps identified by the Regulator, ICMU, internal and external auditors. These remedial measures include improvements in internal controls to ensure non recurrence of highlighted exceptions and are monitored by the Compliance Committee.

The Bank has completed all stages of the ICFR roadmap, issued vide SBP's BSD Circular No. 05 dated February 24, 2009. The Bank has adopted the "COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework" in relation to its Internal Control program in order to ensure consistency in the process of compliance with SBP's Internal Control Guidelines involving documentation, risk assessment, gap analysis, controls testing and controls implementation. Further, in the year 2017, SBP granted exemption for submission of Long Form Report (LFR) through external auditors. Moreover, as per SBP's BSD Circular No. 01 dated July 06, 2021, the banks were allowed to discontinue annual submission of LFR or Annual Assessment Report (AAR) on efficacy of ICFR, to SBP. However, banks shall continue the preparation of AAR on efficacy of the ICFR under ICFR instructions/ framework and Internal Audit Function will review and submit it to Audit Committee for BoD approval, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Management is confident that through adoption of these measures, the Bank's internal control environment is maintained at a satisfactory level.

The BoD endorses the above stated management evaluation of internal controls and ICFR program.

# Directors' Report Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Directors' Report of Faysal Bank Limited ("FBL" or "the Bank") along with Audited Financial Statements and the Auditors' Report thereon for the year ended December 31, 2022.

## Company Profile

FBL was incorporated in Pakistan on October 3, 1994, as a public limited company and its shares are listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. FBL offers a wide range of banking services to all customer segments, i.e. Retail, Small \& Medium Sized Enterprises, Commercial, Agri-based and Corporate.

The Bank's footprint now spreads over 270 cities across the country with 700 branches. In line with FBL's strategy of transforming into a full-fledged Islamic Bank, as of December 31, 2022, all branches are offering only sharia-compliant banking services.

## Holding Company

Ithmaar Bank B.S.C (closed), a banking entity regulated by the Central Bank of Bahrain, is the parent company holding directly and indirectly 66.78\% (2021: 66.78\%) of the Bank's shares. Ithmaar Bank B.S.C. (closed) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ithmaar Holdings B.S.C. Dar Al-Maal Al-Islami Trust (DMIT) is the holding company of Ithmaar Holding B.S.C. and the ultimate parent of the Bank. DMIT was formed by an indenture under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas for the purpose of conducting business affairs in conformity with Islamic law, principles, and traditions.

## Economic Update

In the most recent meeting held on January 23, 2023, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) raised the policy rate by another 100 basis points to 17\% citing persistent inflationary pressures. The average Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the first half of the fiscal year 2023 was $25.1 \%$, as headline inflation remained between $23-26 \%$. Core, food, and energy components of inflation also increased. As Pakistan seeks to re-engage with IMF, inflation is projected to climb. To complete the 9th review, Pakistan has been asked to solve its burgeoning gas (PKR 1.64 Trillion) and power (PKR 2.5 Trillion) circular debts by raising electricity and gas prices, allowing PKR to be traded in line with market forces and imposing taxes to cover for recent shortfall of PKR 200 billion.

GDP growth is now forecasted to dip below 2\% in fiscal year 2023, compared to the previous forecast of above 2\%. Externally, hawkish policies by key central banks have increased the likelihood of a recession as central banks throughout the world continue their tightening cycles to manage inflation rises.

FBR collected PKR 3.43 trillion in 1HFY23 against the assigned target of PKR 3.67 trillion, resulting in a fiscal deficit of 1.5\% of GDP. Further slowdown in economic activity and reduction in imports pose risks to maintaining momentum in tax collection, which may increase pressure on the Government of Pakistan resulting in a more contractionary mini budget.

According to figures from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the trade deficit for the first half of fiscal year 2023 shrunk to USD 17.1 billion, as exports decreased by $5.8 \%$ to USD 14.25 billion, and imports plummeted $22.6 \%$ to USD 31.3 billion. In 1HFY23, workers' remittances declined by 11\% YOY and were at USD 14 billion. The current account deficit shrank during 1HFY23 to only USD 3.7 billion, decreasing by $59.3 \%$ from same period previous year. Despite this contraction of Current Account Deficit (CAD) owing to import restrictions, SBP reserves on December 31, 2022, fell to USD 4.6 billion dollars, the lowest level since 2013-2014. In the second half of fiscal year '23 (2HFY23), Pakistan is obligated to pay USD 8 billion in external debt. Consequently, the default risk appears to be present. The SBP has pledged that the IMF's program will be reinstated within a few weeks, which will draw inflows from friendly nations and international organizations.

Financial and currency markets have remained tense due to economic uncertainty and a balance of payment problem. Credit Default Swap spreads indicate a heightened perception of default (5-year CDS is at 44\%). With the successful completion of the ninth review of Pakistan's IMF program, Pakistan's credit spreads will begin to reduce, and stability will follow once funds from bilateral and multilateral sources become available, as pledged at the Geneva meeting. This will reduce the strain on the SBP's reserves, allay any debt sustainability worries, and enhance mood on the money, foreign exchange, and stock markets.

# Bank's Performance 

2022 was a very challenging year for our country on the economic front and banking industry is directly affected by these uncertainties. However, the bank kept focus on its strategic objectives and not only performed well in terms of balance sheet and profitability growth but also achieved full conversion to Islamic banking. A detailed review of the bank's performance is given in the following paragraphs:

## Journey from Conventional to Islamic

The year 2022 will go down in the chronicles of FBL as the year in which the Bank completed conversion to a full-fledged Islamic Bank. December 31, 2022 was the last day of FBL as a conventional bank and effective January 1, 2023, the bank started its operations as a full-fledged Islamic bank under an Islamic Banking License issued by the State Bank of Pakistan.

As FBL celebrates its successful transition to a full-fledged Islamic bank, this is truly an exceedingly momentous event for us. Alhamdulillah, with the help and blessings of the Almighty, the steadfast vision of the Board, the devotion of the management, the perseverance of the staff and support of our customers, the Bank has successfully completed the greatest conversion of a Conventional Bank into an Islamic Bank in history. This massive Islamic conversion is unprecedented not just in Pakistan, but all around the world and has been confirmed by Islamic International Rating Agency (IIRA) as the largest of its kind in the world. We would also like to acknowledge the tremendous support extended by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), our Shariah Board and guidance by prominent Ulema, and scholars.

The conversion efforts began in August 2014 and since the start of the journey, FBL has successfully converted:

- 211 conventional branches, seamlessly, with minimal to no impact on our customers
- All deposit products which come to PKR 240 Bn+ in conventional deposits
- All financing products that total PKR 190 Bn+ in conventional financing
- All Trade \& Investment products

At the start of this conversion journey, a comprehensive industry analysis and study of FBL's products and portfolio was conducted. It was agreed upon that a learning curve is necessary for a conversion of this scope, and that the strategy will need to be continuously adjusted and validated as new information becomes available. We were watchful and flexible, keeping our eyes on the goal while recognizing the fact that a seamless transition needs to be slow and necessitates monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation to avoid risks of stability to the Bank.

FBL's senior management, under the guidance of Board of Directors and Shariah Board, developed a very well structured and detailed transformation strategy \& execution plan. This plan called for a revamp of FBL's systems, processes, product suite, portfolio, brand and, most importantly, people. As part of the comprehensive Business Transformation Plan (BTP), a senior team of specialists and executives who were dedicated to the cause were formed and empowered to complete the task.

FBL's Board approved the BTP in the year 2016, with a timeline of 5 years, extendable by another two years. The first two years, 2016-2018, were spent on capacity building, and the next four years, 2018-2022, focused on the conversion of conventional branches and portfolio.

A strong conversion governance structure was established under the Board's watchful eyes and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) was appointed as the "Conversion Czar / Program Sponsor". The Bank ensured that the customers and the value of franchise is taken care of by implementing a well-structured and responsible conversion strategy.

By the grace of Almighty Allah and under the oversight of the Board of Directors and Shariah Board, FBL has successfully achieved full Islamic conversion one year ahead of the timeline envisaged in the Corporate Strategy. During this conversion process the bank continued its growth momentum depicting above market growth in balance sheet and profitability. We are



<!-- Page 148 -->

happy to report that over $98 \%$ of our deposits and $96 \%$ of financing portfolio is now Islamic. Residual conventional portfolio which poses some external, unavoidable conversion challenges has been ring-fenced and is being managed as per Shariah guidelines.

An extensive advertising and public relations push is being conducted to celebrate this major milestone. Additionally, the Bank is working on a coffee table book to document and commemorate this historic conversion journey, which will be released during the current quarter.

After successfully managing the largest Islamic conversion, we are committed to work closely with the State Bank of Pakistan and extend our full support to the banking industry for implementing the Federal Shariah Court's judgement directing elimination of Riba from the economy within 5 years.

| Total Assets | $1,074,353$ | 869,612 | 23.5 |

| Profit after tax | 11,233 | 8,153 | 37.8 |
| Earnings per share (Rupees) | 7.40 | 5.37 | 37.8 |

FBL delivered a strong performance in 2022 with a record Profit Before Tax (PBT) of PKR 22.4 billion, 67\% higher than PKR 13.4 billion in the last year. The increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) was however, restricted to 38\% from PKR 8.2 billion in 2021 to PKR 11.2 billion in 2022 due to excessive and retrospective tax measures announced in the Federal Budget. Earnings Per Share at PKR 7.40 was $38 \%$ higher than last year.

The Bank continued its growth trajectory and increased total revenue by 43\% over 2021. Net markup income reached PKR 40.0 billion in 2022, with a growth of $55 \%$ year on year, underpinned by strong balance sheet expansion and improvement in overall spreads. Robust mobilization of current deposits of PKR 63 billion (29\%) YoY and increase in the average benchmark rate helped in improving overall spreads. Non markup income grew by 5\% over last year and was at PKR 9.0 billion in 2022. The growth in non-markup income was undermined due to loss on securities; excluding it, the growth was at $28 \%$.

Non-markup expenses of the bank increased by 32\% over 2021 due to very high inflation, PKR devaluation against USD and increase in branch network. Despite that due to our focus on revenue generation, cost to income ratio improved from $61 \%$ in 2021 to $56 \%$ in 2022. Net provision for 2022 reflected reversal of PKR 0.9 billion against a marginal charge last year. The infection ratio continued to reduce and was at $4.6 \%$ with total coverage at $89 \%$.

FBL crossed the landmark of PKR 1.1 trillion mark in balance sheet footings on the back of strong deposit mobilization and borrowings. Current deposit momentum built over last several quarters continued and they have reached PKR 278 billion depicting a $29 \%$ growth over Dec'21. Total deposits increased by $21 \%$ over December 2021, improving market share from $3.1 \%$ to $3.5 \%$ in Dec'22. Current Account (CA) mix improved to $35 \%$ from $33 \%$ and CASA mix improved to $80 \%$ from $75 \%$.

FBL's net advances increased by 15\% to PKR 455 billion and ADR slightly reduced from 62\% at Dec'21 to 58\% in Dec'22. The Bank generated liquidity from borrowings and invested in Sukuks, as a result investments increased by $31 \%$ and reached PKR 469 billion.

Overall, the bank is well poised to continue growth momentum in profitability and balance sheet and face challenging economic and business environment.

# Business Overview 

## Islamic Banking Division

Islamic Banking Division (IBD) played a crucial role and not only provided support to all departments to transform their respective areas into Shariah Compliant operations but also assisted in conducting training programs all over Pakistan to upscale the level of Islamic knowledge and comprehension. While FBL staff was the primary target audience, awareness sessions were also held for customers at branches, non-customers at mosques, universities etc. and group sessions with traders, trade associations and corporate employees.

During the year around approximately 1,100+ process flows were structured and optimized, 700+ Guarantee texts were processed, 300+ Security arrangements were reviewed, and various customers' and business queries were catered. In addition to that, FBL was involved in a number of Investment Banking transactions and served as Shariah Advisor. IBD launched Revolving Credit Scheme product and Working capital Facilities (WCL) under Tawarruq for its existing Agri based customers. These products were introduced with a goal of converting conventional customers to Islamic. Through this product, the Bank was able to provide Islamic solution for more than 600+ customers and facilitate them in their day-to-day business requirements. The Pool Management Department not only automated the general pool management system but also introduced a treasury-linked pool management system which is first of its kind in Pakistan.

## Retail Banking

FBL was able to grow its market share from $3.1 \%$ in Dec'21 to $3.5 \%$ in Dec'22 by utilizing the branch network. The Bank continued to grow its footprint and added 94 new branches in the network to reach 700 branches at year end. FBL is committed and actively engaged with State Bank of Pakistan in its efforts to support the country's economy under the Financial Inclusion ambit. As per SBP's directives, FBL successfully introduced policies related to Banking on Equality (BoE) and Persons with Disabilities (PWD). FBL proudly serves over 1.2 million customers including 0.2 million female customers.

During 2022, while several new products were added to the suite to cater different market segments; "Amal", a branded account for women with one-stop financial solution, bundled with Health Benefits, Shopping Discounts, Locker Fee Discounts, Saving/Transactional Convenience, was launched. This unique proposition helped in onboarding new 6,500 plus women clients to the network with deposit volume of PKR 1.84 billion. Further, FBL launched 13 dedicated PWD branches across all provinces to facilitate differently abled persons for seamless banking experience with convenience.

## Commercial Banking and Small Medium Enterprises (CBSME)

In a year marked by economic upheaval, expanding the loan book and maintaining credit quality was of utmost significance. The "Branch Led SME model" was effectively adopted by CBSME, which led to a portfolio growth of 25\%; surpassing PKR 50 billion milestone. CBSME also implemented its Final Destination "HUB \& SPOKE Model". This model requires, teams to be stationed at specialized hubs all around the country, where they are responsible for managing both existing relationships and leads referred by surrounding Branches. In 2023, CBSME plans to launch Digital Platform for SME Financing.

## Corporate and Investment Banking Group

The Corporate and Investment Banking Group remained active throughout the year and successfully closed several landmark investment banking deals across the full spectrum of segments. FBL solely led arrangement and advisory mandates for a



<!-- Page 150 -->

significant number of projects and syndications. The Bank successfully negotiated and led transactions worth more than Rs. 60 billion, comprising deals in infrastructure, power, telecommunications, etc.

The total amount of remittances to Pakistan in 2022 was USD 29.5 billion, representing a reduction of almost 5\% from the previous year. The experts in the industry are of the opinion that the disparity in prices between the open market and the interbank market was the driving force behind the usage of informal channels as opposed to banking channels. Even though this influenced Bank's inward remittance business, however, the market share remained in the range of 3\% while transaction count showed an increase of $16 \%$.

# Consumer Banking 

Despite difficult business environment, Consumer Banking had a stellar year, with overall consumer portfolio increasing by $10 \%$, to Rs. 46 billion. In 2021, Noor Card, a Shariah compliant alternative to conventional credit, was launched to facilitate Islamic banking consumers. The Noor Card was a big success and the bank added over 46,000 new customers in 2022. The card spends also grew by $45 \%$ to Rs. 58 billion.

The Roshan Digital Account (RDA) was introduced as a collaborative effort by the Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan to facilitate Non-Resident Pakistanis interested in banking, payment, and investment activities in Pakistan. The program has received tremendous support, and as a result, has developed into a comprehensive product suite that offers cutting-edge and user-friendly digital banking solutions. During 2022, Roshan Digital initiatives portfolio showed a significant growth in deposits and financing.

## Treasury

Treasury has robustly performed in the FX business and was able to increase the FX volumes by offering its clients competitive pricing. Considering the present interest rate environment, prudently investments were made in floating rate Ijarah Sukuks. Numerous individuals have signed up for Faysal Self-Invest, a portal that specializes in Islamic Debt instruments. The Equity Desk remained an active player in the capital market. However, investor morale plummeted throughout the year because of Balance of Payment issue and the ongoing political turmoil. The equity desk proved resilient, and their market knowledge and foresight helped to restrict the loss.

## Digital Banking Group

A strong shift in customer transaction behavior towards digital modes persuaded the Digital Banking Group to continue innovating to ensure that the customers have a seamless banking experience, on digital channels. The Digital Banking Group is serving the retail audience through multiple channels:

## Digital Services

Faysal DigiBank brings convenience, security, and access for customers to perform their banking activities on the go. The channel hosts over 450,000 users of which approximately 150,000 new users were onboarded in 2022, all of whom contributed to over 16 million transactions conducted through the channel.

Amongst the new initiatives in the payments space, the Raast's person-to-person (P2P) payments has seen a healthy uptake. While moving towards the digital era, the Bank now also offers Local Digital Account (LDA), allowing customers to open their Faysal Bank Accounts digitally. This widely popular channel also aided in migration of services, reducing the burden on branches and contact center by introducing Complaint \& Dispute Registration and Credit Card service requests amongst others. Going forward, the platform will be further enhanced to meet the evolving needs of our customers, while staying competitive in the market. To provide a user-friendly experience for its customers, the App's interface and design is undergoing a revamp.

All in all, the channel aims to be a one-stop solution for all its customers, prioritizing customers' needs and staying relevant in the market.

# Value Added Services 

The success of the digital platform is tied to the uptake of its customers across multiple touchpoints. The promotion of selfserve channels is important not only for the Bank but for its customers as well, which can be through the ever-increasing user base of the Faysal Islami WhatsApp Banking, SMS alerts and E-Statement and ATMs.

Faysal Islami WhatsApp Banking has seen sizeable growth in 2022, with over 250,000 retail customers can now connect with the Bank via this channel.

پاکٹان بیورڈ آف اسٹیشنلکس (PBS) کے اعداد و شمار کے مطابق ، وہاں مانی سال 2023 کی پہلی ششہائی میں تجارتی خسارہ 17.1 فیین امریکی ڈائریک پہنچ گیا، نیز برآمدات% 5.8 کمی کے ساتھ 14.5 فیین امریکی ڈائریک پہنچ گئیں اور درآمدات% 22.6 کمی کے بعد 31.3 فیین ڈالر ہو گئیں۔ مانی سال 2023 کی پہلی ششہائی میں ، ورکرز کی ترسیلات زر میں YOY میں 11% کمی واقع ہوئی اور 14 فیین امریکی ڈائریک پہنچ گئی۔ مانی سال 2023 کی پہلی ششہائی کے دوران کرت، اکاؤنٹ خسارہ صرف 3.7 فیین امریکی ڈالر رہا، جو کہ کڈ شیم سال میں اسی مدت سے% 59.3 کم ہے۔ کرت، اکاؤنٹ کے اس سٹارڈ کے باوجود درآمدی پابندیوں کی وجہ سے 31 دسمبر 2022 پر اسٹیٹ ویک کے ڈھانڈ کم ہو کر صرف 4.6 فیین امریکی ڈالر رہ گئے۔ مانی سال 2023 کی دوسری ششہائی (2HFY23) میں ، پاکستان بیرونی قرضوں کی مد میں 8 فیین امریکی ڈالر ادا کرنے کا پابند ہے۔ اس لیے، پہلے سے جاری ڈیفالٹ کا خطرہ موجود رہے گا۔SBP کو توقع ہے کہ IMF کا پروگرام مہم افنتوں میں دوبارہ شروع ہو جائے گا، جو دوست ممالک اور عالمی اداروں کو درآمدات کی طرف متوجہ کرے گا۔

مک میں جاری اندرونی معاشی غیر یقینی اور машин آف مینجمنٹو کے مسئلے کی وجہ سے فینکلل و کرسی مارکینس کی صورتحال اسی طرح تفصیل رہے گی۔ جیسے ہی IMF پاکستان کے پروگرام کا نوین مرتبہ جائزہ کھل کرے گا، پاکستان کے کریڈٹ اسپر یئس کم ہونا شروع ہو جائیں گے، اور ایک مرتبہ فنڈ دو طرفہ اور کثیر الجتنی ڈرائع سے آنا شروع ہو گئے تو استحکام آ جائے گا، جیسے علیوا اعلانس میں عہد کیا گیا۔ اس سے اسٹیٹ ویک کے ڈھانڈ اور قرض کے استحکام پر دباؤ کم ہو جائے گا، اور غیر یقینی زر مبادل اور اسٹاک مارکیٹ پر بہتر اثرات مرتب ہوں گے۔

### بیگ کی کارکردگی

2022 ہمارے ملک کے لیے اقتصادی محاذ پر بہت مشکل سال تھا اور بینکنگ انڈسٹری اس غیر یقینی صورتحال سے براہ راست متاثر ہوتی ہے۔ تاہم ویک نے اپنی حکمت عملی اور مقاصد پر توجہ مرکوز رکھی اور نہ صرف машин شیٹ اور منافع میں اضافے کے لحاظ سے بہترین کارکردگی کا مظاہرہ کیا بلکہ خود کو مکمل طور پر اسلامی ہیکاری میں تبدیل کرنے کا ہدف بھی حاصل کیا۔ ویک کی کارکردگی کا تحصیل جائزہ درج ذیل سفروں میں دیا گیا ہے:

### اسلامی ہیکاری میں پینگی کا سفر

FBL کی تاریخ میں سال 2022 یاد رکھا جائے گا کہ اس میں ویک نے خود کو ایک مکمل اسلامی ویک میں تبدیل کیا۔ 31 دسمبر 2022 FBL کا بطور روایتی ویک آخری دن تھا اور کچھ جنوری 2023 کو ویک نے اسٹیٹ ویک آف پاکستان کی جانب سے جاری کردہ اسلامی بینکنگ الائنسس کے تحت بطور مکمل اسلامی ویک اپنے کام کا آغاز کیا۔

FBL اپنی مکمل طور پر اسلامی ویک میں تبدیلی کا آپشن متار باہے۔ انلمد بند خدا کے فضل و کرم ، بورڈ کے ثابت قدم و بٹن ، انتظامیہ کی ٹکن ، عملے کی استقامت اور ہمارے صارفین کی حمایت سے ، ویک نے اپنے ویک کو اسلامی ویک میں تبدیل ہونے کے ضمیم ترین مکمل کو یاد گام کامیابی سے مکمل کیا۔ اسے بڑے پیمانے کی کنورٹرن نہ صرف پاکستان بلکہ پوری دنیا میں بے مثال ہے اور اسٹانک انٹرنیٹل ریٹنگ ایجنسی (IIRA) نے بھی خصوصی طور پر سراباہے۔ اور ممتاز ملانے کرام ومشترک کے زبردست تھاون اور رہنمائی پر ان کے تبدل سے منظور ہیں۔

کنورٹرن کے سفر کا آغاز اگست 2014 سے ہوا اور جب سے اب تک ایف بی ایل نے کامیابی سے کنورٹ کیا ہے۔ :

- ☆ 211 روایتی شاخص،
- ☆ تمام ذہاڑٹ پر وڈینس 240 + Blr (Rs.240)،
- ☆ تمام فٹائنگ پر وڈینس 190 + Blr (Rs.190)
- ☆ تمام تجارتی اور سرمایہ کاری کی پر وڈینس،

ڈائریکٹرز کا چالڑہ

ان کنسولیڈینڈ مالیاتی کو خوارے برائے سال 2022

ہم بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹرز کی جانب سے، فیصل ویک لملنڈ ("FBL" یا "ویک") کے ڈائریکٹرز کی رپورٹ، آؤٹ شدہ مالیاتی کو خواروں اور آؤٹیزز کی رپورٹ کے ساتھ پیش کرتے ہوئے انکبارسرت کرتے ہیں۔

کمیٹی کائنٹارف:

FBL کا قیام پاکستان میں 3 اکتوبر 1994 کو ایک ویک لملنڈ کمپنی کے طور پر عمل میں آیا اور اس کے قصص پاکستان اسٹاک ایجھچج میں مندرجہ ذیل FBL صارفین کے تمام طبقات جیسے رفیق، چھوٹے اور متوسط درجے کے کاروباری ادارے، گمرش، انگریزی ہیڈ اور کارپوریت کو ہیٹنگ خدمات کی ایک وسیع رجح پیش کرتا ہے۔

ویک کی ملک بھر میں 270 شہروں میں 700 شافھیں ہیں۔ FBL کو ایک مکمل اسلامی ویک میں تبدیل کرنے کی حکمت عملی کے مطابق، 31 دسمبر 2022 کو ویک کی تمام شاخیں شرعی اصولوں کے عین مطابق خدمات فراہم کر رہی ہیں۔

بولڈنگ کمپنی

اتار ویک B.S.C (کلوئز)، ایک ہیٹنگ ادارہ ہے جو مرکزی ویک آف جرن کے ذریعے ریکولیت کیا جاتا ہے، یہ مرکزی کمپنی ہے، جو فیصل ویک لملنڈ میں بالواسطہ یا بلاواسطہ 66.78% (2021: 66.78) قصص کی حامل ہے۔ اتار ویک B.S.C (کلوئز) اتار بولڈنگز B.S.C کا منقلیتی ذیلی ادارہ ہے اور دارالمال الاسلامی ٹرسٹ (DMIT) اتار بولڈنگز B.S.C کی بولڈنگ کمپنی ہے اور بنیادی طور پر ویک کی سر پرست ہے۔ DMIT کو انڈسٹر کے ذریعے دولت مشترکہ بہاماس کے قوانین کے تحت اسلامی قانون، اصولوں اور روایت کے مطابق کاروباری امور کو انجام دینے کے مقصد سے تشکیل دیا گیا تھا۔

تازہ ترین اقتصادی صورتحال:

23 جولوی 2023 کو منعقدہ مانیٹری پالیسی کمپنی کے اجلاس میں، اسٹیٹ ویک آف پاکستان (SBP) نے مسلسل افراط زر کے دباؤ کا حوالہ دینے ہوئے پالیسی ریت کو مزید 100 بنیادی پوائنٹس سے بڑھا کر %17 کر دیا ہے۔ مالی سال 2023 کی پہلی ششہائی کے دوران کمزیم مر پر اُس انڈیکس (CPI) کی عمومی شرح %25.1 رہی، جبکہ ہیڈ لائن افراط زر کی شرح 23-26 فیصد کے درمیان رہی۔ مرحلال کی شرح مزید بڑھنے کا امکان انکوئیٹمہ پاکستان دوبارہ MF سے رجوع کرنے کا خواہش مند ہے۔ نوین مرحلہ نظر خالی کو عمل کرتے ہوئے، پاکستان کو کہا ہے کہ وہ اپنی پہلی ویکس کی قیمتوں میں اضافہ کر کے اپنے کپس (1.64 ٹریمن روپے) اور پہلی (2.5 ٹریمن روپے) کے بڑھتے ہوئے خسارے کو کم کرے، روپے کی قدہ کو تہارتی مارکیٹ کی قوتوں کے ساتھ جوڑنے اور حالیہ 200 ملیں روپے کے نقصان کے الزامے کے لیے مزید سیکسرا لاگو کرے۔

مالی سال 2023 میں جی ڈی پی کی نمو گزشتہ %2 سے اوپر کی پیش گوئی کے مقابلے میں اب %2 سے کم رہنے کی پیش گوئی کی گئی ہے۔ جیسا کہ دنیا بھر میں مرکزی میٹکوں نے افراط زر پر قابو پانے کے لیے کئی اقدامات کیے ہیں، جس کی وجہ سے کساد بازاری کے امکانات بڑھ گئے ہیں۔

FBR نے مالی سال 23 کی پہلی ششہائی میں اپنے 3.67 ٹریمن روپے کے مقررہ ہدف کے مقابلے میں 3.43 ٹریمن روپے وصول کی ہے، جس کے نتیجے میں GDP کا %1.5 مالی خسارہ ہوا ہے۔ مزید یہ کہ اقتصادی سرگرمیوں میں سنت روی اور درآمدات میں کمی سے ٹیکس وصول کی رفتار کو برقرار رکھنے کے خطرات لائق ہیں، جس کے نتیجے میں مزید سخت تنی بجٹ لانے کا حکومت پاکستان پر دباؤ بڑھ سکتا ہے۔

# Independent Auditor's Report 

## To the members of Faysal Bank Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the annexed unconsolidated financial statements of Faysal Bank Limited (the Bank), which comprise the unconsolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, and the unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and the unconsolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, along with unaudited certified returns received from the branches except for 45 branches which have been audited by us and notes to the unconsolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information and we state that we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of the audit.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the unconsolidated statement of financial position, unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes forming part thereof conform with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, and, give the information required by the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017), in the manner so required and respectively give a true and fair view of the state of the Bank's affairs as at December 31, 2022 and of the profit and other comprehensive income, the changes in equity and its cash flows for the year then ended.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Following is the Key Audit Matter:

| S.No. | Key Audit Matter | How the matter was addressed in our audit |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | Provision against advances: <br> (Refer notes 6.5 \& 11.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements). |  |



<!-- Page 174 -->

| S.No. | Key Audit Matter | How the matter was addressed in our audit |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | The Bank makes provision against advances on a time-based criteria that involves ensuring that all non-performing advances are classified in accordance with the ageing criteria specified in the Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). <br> In addition to the above time-based criteria, the PRs require a subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of borrowers to determine the classification of advances. <br> The PRs also require the creation of general provision for certain categories of advances. <br> The Bank has recognised a net reversal of provision against advances amounting to Rs. 457.485 million in the unconsolidated profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2022, the Bank holds a provision of Rs. 19,329.026 million against advances. <br> The determination of provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank, we considered the area of provision against advances as a key audit matter. | Our audit procedures to verify provision against advances included, amongst others, the following: <br> We obtained an understanding of the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls established by the Bank to identify loss events and for determining the extent of provisioning required against non-performing advances. <br> The testing of controls included testing of: <br> - controls over correct classification of nonperforming advances on time-based criteria; <br> - controls over monitoring of advances with higher risk of default and correct classification of nonperforming advances on subjective criteria; <br> - controls over accurate computation and recording of provisions; and <br> - controls over the governance and approval process related to provisions, including continuous reassessment by the management. <br> We selected a sample of loan accounts and performed the following substantive procedures: <br> - checked repayments of loans / mark-up installments and tested classification of nonperforming advances based on the number of days overdue; and <br> - evaluated the management's assessment for classification of a borrower's loan facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern, inspection of credit documentation and discussions with the management. <br> We checked the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances and of general provision made against performing advances as per the requirements of PRs by recomputing the provision amount in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the Prs. |

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Reports Thereon 

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.



<!-- Page 176 -->

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
a) proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
b) the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
c) investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and



<!-- Page 177 -->

d) Zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty percent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Noman Abbas Sheikh.

Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.
2.2 As at December 31, 2022, all the branches of the Bank are Islamic. The financial results of the Islamic banking branches have been consolidated in these unconsolidated financial statements for reporting purposes after eliminating inter branch transactions and balances. The financial results of all Islamic banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these unconsolidated financial statements.
2.3 The Bank has controlling interest in Faysal Asset Management Limited (FAML) and is required to prepare consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

## 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

3.1 These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.
3.2 As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R\&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation of intangible assets against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such assets identified as a result of such acquisition. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has adjusted an amortisation of intangible assets net of tax amounting to Rs. 68.1 million (2021: Rs. 50.1 million) from the NCR.
3.3 The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS-3, 'Profit and loss sharing on deposits' for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by the SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IIFS. These reporting requirements have not been notified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these unconsolidated financial statements.
3.4 The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has also deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial instruments: disclosures' through its S.R.O. 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.
3.5 The SECP through S.R.O. 56(1)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirements of IFRS 10, 'Consolidated financial statements' are not applicable in case of investments by companies in mutual funds established under Trust Deed structure. Accordingly, implications of IFRS 10 in respect of investment in mutual funds are not considered in these unconsolidated financial statements.
3.6 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current year:

There are certain new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on January 1, 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.
3.7 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

### 3.7.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2021. SBP via same circular has finalized the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 1, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank's financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

## Equity Securities

Equity instruments are generally measured as Fair Value through Profit \& Loss (FVPL) unless the Bank elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) at initial recognition.



<!-- Page 185 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
For equity shares held as available-for-sale (AFS) with surplus / deficit recorded in OCI, the Bank may elect these equity shares as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognised in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

For those equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will be measured at fair value through profit or loss. The surplus / deficit related to these securities currently presented in equity, will be reclassified to retained earnings, with no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation for one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

## Debt securities and loans and advances

Those debt securities that are currently classified as AFS and pass the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Certain debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI criteria shall be measured at FVPL regardless of the business model in which they are held.

## Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses ('ECL') resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL').

## Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at January 1, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 600 to 850 million, representing corresponding impact.

The Bank continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption.

In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has allowed a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting over a period of 5 years.
3.7.2 The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

## Standards, interpretations or amendments

- Narrow Scope amendments to IAS 1, Practice statement and IAS 8
- Amendment to IAS 12 - deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction
- Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases on sale and leaseback
- Amendment to IAS 1- Non current liabilities with covenants

Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)

January 1, 2023
January 1, 2023
January 1, 2024
January 1, 2024
The above amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements of the Bank.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
3.7.3 The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 9, 2023 has specified the new reporting format for financial statements of Banking Companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements and will become applicable for the financial statements of the Bank for the quarter ending March 31, 2023.
3.7.4 As required under SBP Letter No. BPRD/LD-01/850/28853/2022-13054, the details of the net conventional funded portfolio as at December 31, 2022 are as follows:

## Rupees in '000

## Assets

$5,815,098$
Investments**
$17,302,360$
Advances
$16,456,105$

## Liabilities

* These matured on January 3, 2023
* Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has disposed-off PIBs amounting to Rs. 3.5 billion.


## 4 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which have been carried at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payments and costs as disclosed in details in note 6.23 to these unconsolidated financial statements) and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

### 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgments in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## 5 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

5.1 Items included in these unconsolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates. These unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.
5.2 Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand of rupees unless otherwise stated.

## 6 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.

### 6.1 Business Combination

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Bank's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. However, as more fully described in note 13.3 to these unconsolidated financial statements, the gain on bargain purchase arising on an acquisition made in 2010 has been recognised directly in equity as per the directives of the SBP.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment as per the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36, 'Impairment of assets'. Impairment charge in respect of goodwill is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account and is not subsequently reversed.

Acquisition of non-controlling interests (NCI) is measured at the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired by the Bank. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the proportionate share of the NCl in the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised in equity.

### 6.2 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks in current and deposit accounts, national prize bonds and overdrawn nostro accounts.

### 6.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Bank enters into repurchase agreement (repo) and reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

## (a) Sale of securities under repurchase agreements

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in the unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings. The difference between the sale and contracted repurchase price is accrued over the period of the contract and recorded as an expense.

## (b) Purchase of securities under repurchase agreements

Securities purchased under agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognised in the unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lendings. The difference between the purchase and contracted resale price is accrued over the period of the contract and recorded as income.

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## (c) Musharaka / Modaraba placements

In Musharaka / Modaraba, the Bank invests in the Shari'ah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio under musharaka agreements.

## (d) Bai Muajjal

Bai Muajjal transactions with the SBP and other financial institutions are classified under lendings. In Bai Muajjal, the Bank sells Shari'ah compliant instruments on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period.

### 6.4 Investments

### 6.4.1 Classification

The Bank classifies its investments as follows:

## (a) Held for trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for the purpose of generating profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices, interest rate movements, or dealer's margin or are securities included in the portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit making exists.

## (b) Held to maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and maturity that the Bank has a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.

## (c) Available for sale

These are investments, other than those, in associates and subsidiaries, that do not fall under either held for trading or held to maturity categories.

## (d) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control.

## (e) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Bank has control.

### 6.4.2 Initial recognition and measurement

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by the regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investment.

Investments other than those classified as held for trading are initially recognised at fair value which includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Investments classified as 'held for trading' are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs associated with the transactions are expensed in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

### 6.4.3 Subsequent measurement:

## Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.



<!-- Page 189 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

## Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the unconsolidated statement of financial position within equity and is taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investments are considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. A decline in the carrying value is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, upto the cost of the investment, is credited to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

### 6.4.4 Impairment

Impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale (except term finance certificates and sukuk certificates) and held to maturity is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a listed equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. Provision for diminution in the value of term finance certificates and sukuk certificates is made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment of available for sale securities, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities on the unconsolidated statement of financial position within equity is removed therefrom and recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account. For investments classified as held to maturity, the impairment loss is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

Gain or loss on sale of investments is included in the unconsolidated profit and loss account.
Premium or discount on acquisition of investments is amortised through the unconsolidated profit and loss account over the remaining period till maturity using the effective interest method.

### 6.4.5 Investment in associates and subsidiaries

Investment in associates and subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment, if any.
The carrying amount of associates and subsidiaries are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 6.7 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

### 6.5 Advances

6.5.1 Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Specific provision for advances is made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP which is based on the time based criteria and subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrowers. The amount of provision is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the relevant regulations and the management's judgment as explained in note 11.4.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. The Bank offers various Islamic financing products the details of which are as follows:

## (a) Murabaha

## (b) Diminishing Musharaka

It is a form of partnership in which the Bank and customers create co-ownership in the asset by purchasing it jointly. The Bank then rents out its share of the asset to customers. Besides the payment of rentals, customer also purchase the asset from the Bank in installments. Hence at the end of the tenure, customer becomes sole owner of the asset.

## (c) Running Musharaka

## (d) Ijarah

Ijarah is a contract whereby the owner of an asset (other than consumables) transfers its usufruct to another person for an agreed period and for an agreed consideration.
ljarah assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.

Impairment of ljarah assets is determined on the same basis as that of operating fixed assets.
ljarah rental income is recognised on an accrual basis as and when the rental becomes due. Impairment of ljarah rentals receivable is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP and charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

### 6.5.2 Net investment in finance lease

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are classified as finance lease. A receivable is recognised on the commencement of lease term at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, including guaranteed residual value, if any. Unearned finance income is recognised over the term of the lease, so as to produce a constant periodic return on the outstanding net investment in lease. Specific and general provisions for net investment in finance lease are made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP and charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

### 6.6 Fixed assets and depreciation

## (a) Tangible assets

Operating fixed assets other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on operating fixed assets (excluding land which is not depreciated) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements after taking into account residual value, if significant. The asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if required, at each reporting date. Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account as and when incurred.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains / losses on disposal of fixed assets, if any, are taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account in the period in which these arise except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

## (b) Capital work-in-progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## (c) Intangible assets

Intangible assets having definite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The intangible assets include directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the intangible asset. Amortisation, except for customer relationship, is charged by applying the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. Amortisation is calculated so as to write-off the assets over their expected economic lives at rates specified in note 13 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Amortisation is charged from the month in which the asset is available for use. No amortisation is charged for the month in which the asset is disposed of. The intangible asset comprising customer relationship is being amortised over the life expectancy of the deposits. The residual values and useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Gains and losses on disposals, if any, are taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account in the period in which these arise.

### 6.7 Impairment

The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amount, except in the case of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination for which impairment is tested annually irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the unconsolidated profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of asset.

An impairment loss is reversed except for impairment loss relating to goodwill, if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. Such reversals are only made to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.

### 6.8 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the unconsolidated profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

## Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year. Tax charge for the current year is determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation. The charge for the current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

## Prior

The charge / reversals for prior years represent adjustments to the tax charge / reversals for prior years, arising from assessments, changes in estimates, and retrospectively applied changes to the law, made during the current year.



<!-- Page 193 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, the Bank also records deferred tax asset on available tax losses. Deferred tax is calculated using the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

The Bank also recognises deferred tax asset / liability on deficit / surplus on revaluation of securities, fixed assets (other than land) and assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (other than land) which is adjusted against the related deficit / surplus in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 12, 'Income Taxes'.

### 6.9 Assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying values do not differ materially from their fair values. Legal fee, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to the non-banking assets are charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account and these are not capitalised as part of non-banking assets. A surplus arising on revaluation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account. Any deficit arising on revaluation is first set off against the surplus account for that particular non-banking asset, if any, or if no surplus exists, is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. These assets are disclosed in other assets as specified by the SBP.

Surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

### 6.10 Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

Contingent assets are not recognised and are also not disclosed unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

### 6.11 Staff retirement benefits

## a) Defined contribution plan

The Bank operates a contributory provident fund for all its permanent employees to which equal monthly contributions at the rate of 10 percent of basic salary are made both by the Bank and the employees.

## b) Defined benefit scheme

Staff retirement benefits are payable to staff on completion of prescribed qualifying period of service under these schemes.

### 6.12 Borrowings / deposits and their costs

Borrowings / deposits are recorded at the proceeds received. Borrowing / deposit costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which these are incurred to the extent that they are not directly attributable to the acquisition of or construction of qualifying assets. Borrowing cost that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.

### 6.13 Subordinated loans

Subordinated loans are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received. Profit on subordinated loans is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account over the period on an accrual basis and is recognised separately as part of other liabilities.

### 6.23 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

At the inception of the contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Bank applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are presented within note 12 and are subject to impairment in line with the Bank's policy as described in note 6.7 .

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

### 6.24 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity and recognised at their face value. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

### 6.25 Reserves

Reserves being held by the Bank in these unconsolidated financial statements include the following;

- Non- distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase option (note 3.2).

### 12.2.4 Lease modifications

During the current year, the Bank has renegotiated a number of existing lease agreements resulting in a modification of these lease agreements under IFRS 16, 'Leases'. These lease modifications pertain to:
i) a change in consideration of the lease(s);
ii) an increase in the scope of the lease(s) due to an extension in the contractual lease terms; or
iii) termination of existing lease(s) due to relocation of the branches to new premises.

In case of (i) and (ii) above, the Bank has remeasured the lease liabilities by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rates and making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets.

In case of (iii) above, the Bank has decreased the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities to reflect the full termination of the lease, taking any resultant gain or loss on such termination to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
13.2.1 The cost of fully amortised intangible assets that are still in the Bank's use is as follows:

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | $\qquad$ Rupees '000------------- |  |
| Computer software | 1,980,879 | 1,980,879 |
| Customer relationship | 1,099,722 | 1,099,722 |
|  | 3,080,601 | 3,080,601 |

13.2.2 This represents an intangible asset (customer relationship) which comprises of core deposits which were recognised at the time of acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. These core deposits represent the funding benefit that would be available to the Bank on account of availability of funding through deposit customers rather than from the wholesale or interbank market. This benefit also considers the fact that the economic life time of these deposits is longer than their contractual life. Based on this assumption, this intangible asset had been valued using certain valuation techniques and is being amortised over the life expectancy of these deposits. As more fully explained in note 13.3 to these unconsolidated financial statements, the SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation charge arising on this intangible asset against non-distributable capital reserve. The remaining amortisation period of this intangible asset is ranging from 3 to 8 years.

### 13.3 Non-distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase

As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R\&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as non-distributable capital reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation of the intangible asset against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such asset. Accordingly, the Bank has adjusted amortisation of intangible asset amounting to Rs 68.149 million (2021: Rs. 50.1 million) (net of tax) from the nondistributable capital reserve.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
22.3.1 Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised upto the tax year 2022(accounting year ended December 31, 2021). Income tax return for tax year 2023 (accounting year ended December 31, 2022) will be filed by the Bank within stipulated timeline.

The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [(CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.
22.4 There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 29,453 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by exemployees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements.

### 22.5 Commitments to extend credits

The Bank makes commitments to extend credit (including to related parties) in the normal course of its business but these being revocable commitments do not attract any significant penalty or expense if the facilities are unilaterally withdrawn except for Rs. 15,473 million (2021: Rs. 31,655 million) which are irrevocable in nature.

### 36.11 Sensitivity analysis

The analysis based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption should be summarised as illustrated below:

1\% increase in discount rate
$1 \%$ decrease in discount rate
$1 \%$ increase in expected rate of salary increase
$1 \%$ decrease in expected rate of salary increase
1 year increase in expected life / withdrawal rate
1 year decrease in expected life / withdrawal rate

36.13 Expected contributions to be paid to the scheme in the next financial year
36.14 Expected charge for the next financial year
36.15 Maturity profile

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 7.68 years.

### 36.16 Funding policy

The policy followed by the Bank in respect of the staff retirement benefit schemes is disclosed in note 6.11 of these unconsolidated financial statements.
36.17 The gratuity scheme exposes the Bank to the following risks:

## Asset volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Islamic Fund is invested in Faysal Savings Growth Fund and Ijarah Sukuk. The investment is almost $17.57 \%$ (Rs 279 million) for Faysal saving Funds while $55.85 \%$ (Rs 886 million for Ijarah Sukuk. Islamic Fund have not such investment in any Government Bonds, equity or Corporate Bonds hence the asset volatility risk is lower.

## Changes in bond yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in Bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the Gratuity Liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in Bond yields will lower the Gratuity Liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the Asset values.

## Inflation risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.

## Life expectancy / withdrawal rate

The Gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The Life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the Gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post- retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post-retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions. In this case, it is not a significant risk.

## Other risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes :

- retention risk - The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

- final salary risk - The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- model risk - The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the Gratuity Fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- operational risk related to a separate entity - Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit Funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- compliance risk - The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- legal/political risk - The risk that the legal/political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.


## 37 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Bank operates an approved funded contributory provident fund for all its permanent employees to which equal monthly contributions are made both by the Bank and the employees at the rate of $10 \%$ of the basic salary. The financial statements of the fund are separately prepared and are not included as part of these unconsolidated financial statements.

## 39 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

### 39.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:



<!-- Page 232 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

## On-balance sheet financial instruments

## Financial assets - measured at fair value

## Investments

Federal Government securities
Shares
Non-Government debt securities

## Financial assets - disclosed but not measured at fair value

## Investments

Non-Government debt securities (note 10.7.1)

## Non-financial assets - measured at fair value

Fixed assets (land and buildings)
Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims
Off-balance sheet financial instruments - measured at fair value
Forward purchase of foreign exchange
Forward sale of foreign exchange
Derivatives sales

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date when the event or change in circumstances require the Bank to exercise such transfers.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.
Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Pakistan Investment Bonds / Market <br> Treasury Bills | Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Treasury Bills are derived using the PKRV / <br> PKFRV rates. |
| Ijara Sukuk | Fair values of GoP ljara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the <br> Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of <br> quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers. |
| Unlisted ordinary shares | Break-up value is determined on the basis of the NAV of the company using the latest <br> available audited financial statements. |
| Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) <br> and Sukuk Certificates | Fair values of TFCs and Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates. |
| Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates <br> announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. |
| Derivative instruments | The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are <br> valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate <br> swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently <br> applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value <br> calculations. |
| Mutual funds | Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual <br> Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). |

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 3

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Fixed assets (land and buildings) | Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting <br> policy disclosed in note 6.6. |
| Non-banking assets (NBAs) <br> acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in <br> note 6.9. |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements.

## 44 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management group (RMG) has been organised under the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). It has been authorised by the Board of Directors (BoD) to monitor the implementation of various risk policies via implementation of an integrated risk management framework across the Bank. As an ongoing exercise to integrate risk related functions, RMG has been expanded, strengthened and entrusted to monitor the risk areas across the organisation, including adoption and convergence towards regulatory and Basel guidelines on risk management.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are timely and accurately identified and assessed, properly documented, approved and adequately monitored and managed in order to ensure that risk taking activities are in line with the guidelines approved by the BoD and to protect the interests of the Bank's depositors and shareholders.

The 'risk management framework' at the Bank encompasses:

- scope of risks to be managed;
- process, systems and procedures to manage risk; and
- roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk management.

The Bank has adopted an approach that gives an integrated view of the risks faced by the organisation. This calls for aligning strategic vision, policy objectives and business processes / procedures within the risk management framework. The management of risk is integrated with the Bank's management of capital and strategy. This ensures that risks taken in pursuit of the Bank's strategic objectives are consistent with the policies, translating into targeted shareholder return as well as the Bank's desired credit rating and risk appetite.

With this in view, the risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guidelines to cater to changing business dynamics. The risk management framework includes:

- clearly defined risk management policies;
- well constituted organisational structure; and
- mechanism for ongoing review of all policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The 'risk management framework' is built on the following elements:

- comprehensive risk governance; and
- effective risk processes.

The Bank has developed and implemented a governance and management structure, processes surrounding each risk area, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital management, operational risk, environmental risk and information security risk.

The essential components which contribute in effective management of all these risks are as follows:

- active board / senior management strategic direction and centralised RMG oversight;
- sufficient policies, procedures and limits;
- adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and
- comprehensive internal controls.

The Board of Directors (BoD) monitoring and oversight is facilitated through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), comprising of directors including the President \& CEO. It is appointed and authorised by the BoD to assist in the design, regular evaluation and timely updation of the risk management framework. The BRMC has further authorised management committees such as Country Credit Committee (CCC), Agriculture Credit Committee (ACC), Enterprise Risk

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Management Committee (ERMC) and Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) to supervise risk management activities within their respective areas.

In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with business, RMG has separate risk management functions for credit risk management, based on the specialised skill sets and required specific experience in various business segments. These functions comprise of corporate risk, CBSME, agri and retail risk management.

The common responsibilities of all credit risk management functions include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with compliance department of the Bank to ensure conformity to the relevant Government regulations, the SBP PRs as well as internal policies.
- work with relationship teams to structure exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure adequate risk coverage.

The risk management architecture is further fostered by enterprise risk management, risk policy \& analytics, information security function and an independent credit administration department.

The enterprise risk management function is responsible for managing and controlling market, operational and liquidity risks at an enterprise level and monitoring regulatory capital requirements of the Bank.

Credit administration department - independent from the Risk Management function - looks after the security, loan documentation, disbursement and post disbursement monitoring aspects of the credit portfolio.

Risk policy and analytics department serves as an independent check in the risk management function. It performs periodic review of all credit related portfolios (corporate, CBSME, retail, agri, SAM) and analyses portfolio compositions, risk rating distributions, emerging trends of NPLs, renewal status of Risk Approvals (RAs) as per policy and other policy related matters. It also formulates / updates credit policies (along with various limits prescribed therein) in line with regulatory environment, business strategy, the BoD approvals and the best practices.

The information security risk function is responsible for information security risk identification, monitoring and reporting.

### 44.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that a counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Bank due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct lending activities as well as contingent liabilities.

The Bank's credit risk philosophy is based on the Bank's overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities, appropriately rated, appropriately structured, appropriately priced and documented.

The Bank deals with many different types of borrowers and borrowing structures across the corporate, commercial, SME, agriculture and retail segments. The Bank manages customer credit risk exposures within appropriate limits to ensure that it does not provide a disproportionate level of credit to a single customer or group of connected clients. The Bank follows aggregation principles - summing of credit risk limits to the same customer, or group of connected clients to identify and manage effectively all significant credit risk exposures to a single customer within an individual business and, where appropriate, across other business segments.

The Bank has well-defined credit approval and review processes under which senior officers with the requisite credit background, critically scrutinise, advise and discuss associated risks and recommend / review / approve credit facilities and financing, through respective credit committees. Besides financial, industry and transaction analysis, in order to

#### Abstract

quantify risks of counterparty, the credit evaluation also includes risk rating system to evaluate risk rating of the customers which is then monitored on a portfolio basis to gauge the Bank's credit portfolio quality. To avoid risk concentration, counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.


With a view to develop and effectively manage a diversified credit portfolio within each business segment (as an integral part of the credit risk management process), the Bank has adopted the concept of an industry / sector-wise exposure concentration grid which dictates target market exposures.

As part of the Bank's portfolio strategy and planning activity, these industry concentration limits are continually overseen by the management against the Bank's approved exposures in these sectors and reviewed by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in its meetings with an aim to monitor the overall risk and to avoid high exposure to a single group or industry.

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody's and S\&P Global lowered the country's sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained volatile through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of $27.32 \%$ in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to $16 \%$. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

The Bank is regularly conducting credit portfolio reviews to assess early warning signs, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Bank is confident that it has adequate capacity to withstand these difficult times.

### 44.1.1 Segment by class of business

Credit Risk Management (CRM) Framework (non-retail / non-individual portfolio) covers three business segments: corporate risk management, commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management and retail risk management. Based on overall guidance provided by a recognised and established external consultant, in line with the global best practices while ensuring regulatory compliance and alleviation of any (perceived) conflict of interest, credit management process has been segregated into two distinct categories:

- independent risk advice by risk management function.
- credit approvals by credit committee(s), while taking into consideration the business unit recommendations / approvals and independent risk advice.

With this segregation, the role of risk management function in credit approval process is focused to provide risk advice only, based on key risk parameters; whereas relevant credit committees are responsible for providing credit related approvals.

The common responsibilities of corporate risk management and commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with relationship teams to advise on structure of exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure risk coverage.
- work with the independent credit risk review team (under internal audit) for effective and periodic review of the credit portfolio.

Retail risk management is responsible for managing the credit risk of consumer finance credit products, with credit facilities extended to individual (non-corporate) customers. The consumer finance / retail finance function operates on a

program approach, which are approved by the Country Credit Committee and subsequently by the BoD. The retail risk management provides its input on risk parameters in term of 'risk advice', at the time of approval / changes in product programs. The retail risk management also ensures that all the ongoing individual credit approvals are within pre-defined risk parameters as per the approved product programs.

### 44.1.2 Credit risk: general disclosures Basel specific

The Bank has adopted the standardised approach under Basel. According to the regulatory statement submitted under the standardised approach, the portfolio has been divided into claims on public sector entities in Pakistan (PSEs), claims on corporate (excluding equity exposure) and claims categorised as retail portfolio. Claims on corporate constitute $60.12 \%$ (2021: $65.11 \%$ ) of the total credit risk weighted assets, $1.00 \%$ (2021: 1.79\%) represents claims on PSEs and $15.31 \%$ (2021: 14.49\%) exposure pertains to claims categorised as retail portfolio.

### 44.1.3 Credit risk: disclosures for portfolio subject to standardised approach

For domestic claims, external credit assessment institutions (ECAls) recommended by the SBP, namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and VIS Credit Rating Company Limited are used. For claims on foreign entities, ratings assigned by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody's are used. Exposures not rated by any of the aforementioned rating agencies are categorised as unrated.

| Exposures | PACRA | VIS | Standard <br> and Poor's | Moody's | Fitch |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Corporate | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | - | - | - |
| Banks | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| Sovereigns | - | - | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| PSEs | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | - | - | - |

The SBP's indicative mapping process as instructed in the SBP's circular "Minimum capital requirements for banks and DFIs" (indicated in table below) was used to map alpha numeric ratings of PACRA, VIS, S\&P's. Moody's, Fitch ratings, and numeric scores of ECAs, to the SBP's rating grades.

Long term rating grades mapping

| SBP rating | ECA scores | PACRA | VIS | S \& P | Moody's | Fitch |

### 44.2 Market Risk

It is the risk that the value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as benchmark rates, deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and / or commodity prices resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. Market risks arise generally from trading activities, open foreign currency positions, holding common equity and other products. All such instruments and transactions are exposed to general and specific market movements.

The Bank seeks to mitigate market risk by employing strategies that correlate price, rate and spread movements of its earning assets, liabilities and trading activities. Treasury front office, market risk management and treasury middle office perform market risk management activities within the Bank. The Bank has Enterprise Risk Management Committee which is responsible for recommending market risk policies and strategies for the Board approval and its subsequent implementation and review.

### 44.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Bank undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP.

Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank's approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

### 44.2.3 Equity position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk arising from unfavourable fluctuations in prices of shares in which the Bank carries positions. It is a risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in the value of equity related portfolios of the Bank. Price risk associated with equities could be systematic or unsystematic. Systematic risk is due to sensitivity of portfolio's value to changes in overall level of equity prices, while unsystematic risk is associated with price volatility that is determined by the specific characteristics of the investee company.

The Bank's equity position is governed by position limits imposed by the SBP for overall investment and per scrip exposure. Additionally, there are internal limits set to manage overall earnings in the form of stop loss limits and maintain a diverse portfolio through sector concentration limits.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Yield curve risk is the risk that a financial instrument will suffer either a decline in income or capital because future changes in prevailing interest rates impact assets more or less than they impact liabilities.

The interest rate risk of the Bank arises when there is a mismatch between contractual maturities, which are subject to interest rate adjustment within a specified period or re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Risk is addressed by Asset and Liability Management Committee that reviews the interest rate dynamics at regular intervals and decides re-pricing of assets and liabilities to ensure that the spread of the Bank remains at an acceptable level.

Major sources of interest rate risk are;
i) differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk);
ii) changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting the Bank's activities (basis risk);
iii) changing rate relationships across the range of maturities (yield curve risk);
iv) interest-related options embedded in the Bank's products (options risk); and
v) changes in marked-to-market value of financial instruments which occur when interest rate changes (price risk).

### 44.3 Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors or from external events. The Bank's businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and losses originate from business / operational process failure, IT security failure, natural disasters, dependence on key suppliers, fraud, service quality compromises, regulatory non-compliance, loss of key staff and social and environmental impacts.

The operational risk management function is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Bank. The operational risk management framework of the Bank is governed by the operational risk management policy and procedures, while the implementation is supported by an operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Bank. The framework is in line with international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

The Bank has implemented an effective operational risk management framework for managing operational risk. Each department has processes and system controls in place to address operational risks within their area. Operational loss data is collected through a well defined program implemented across the Bank. Periodic workshops are conducted for risk and control self assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key risk indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation. Regular updates on operational risk status is presented to Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and the Board of Directors through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

## Operational risk-disclosures Basel II specific

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Bank is currently using basic indicator approach for calculating operational risk capital charge.
Under basic indicator approach the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed percentage (denoted alpha) of average positive annual gross income of the Bank over the past three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero, should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average.

### 44.4 Shariah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR)

Shariah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR) is the risk that arises from a bank's failure to comply with the Shariah rules and principles prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan and Shariah Board of the Bank. Managing Shariah non-compliance risk is vital for the establishment of an effective Shariah governance system. Shariah compliance is critical to an Islamic bank's operations and such compliance requirements must permeate throughout the organization and its products and

activities.
Faysal Bank Limited (FBL), being converted into an Islamic Bank is fully aware of the importance and implication of Shariah non-compliance risk on its business and strategy and therefore, ensures Shariah compliance in its business activities \& operations. FBL has also developed a comprehensive framework for Shariah Non-Compliance Risk management, which entails identification, assessment, monitoring / controlling and reporting of SNCR residing in the Bank.

### 44.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due and to replenish funds when they are withdrawn.

Liquidity risk management framework is governed by the liquidity risk management policy. The policy provides specific directives for measuring and managing liquidity risk identifies responsible personnel; and defines their respective roles and responsibilities relating to liquidity risk management.

The management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BoD)
- Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)
- Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)
- Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)
- Treasury
- Risk management (enterprise risk management)
- Finance

The BoD approves the liquidity risk management policy including risk limits and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the BRMC, that the Bank's liquidity risk is being managed prudently. The BRMC plays a strategic role in liquidity risk management by overseeing the liquidity risk profile of the Bank. ERMC defines the risk tolerance levels and setting risk limits for effective liquidity risk management. ALCO ensures adherence with policy requirements and risk limits so that the Bank remains sufficiently liquid at all times.

The market and liquidity risk under enterprise risk management function overseas liquidity risk. The Bank's Asset and Liability Committee manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis.

The Bank ensures to maintain a diversified portfolio of liquid assets and funding base. Sources of funding comprise of a good mix of core deposits. Concentration in deposit, especially large volume deposits, is closely monitored to anticipate any potential liquidity issues in case of their withdrawals.

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like liquid assets to liquid liabilities, liquid assets to total deposits, large volume deposits to total deposits, advances to deposit, liquid assets to volatile funding; on a regular basis against defined limits. Further, liquidity gaps over different time bands, are also monitored through maturity profiling of assets and liabilities. The Bank also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times. In addition, the Bank has also implemented the SBP's Basel III liquidity standards for ensuring compliance with the requirements of LCR, NSFR and other monitoring tools.

The Bank performs liquidity stress testing on periodic basis in order to ensure sufficient liquidity is always available to meet financial obligations / commitments. Stress testing aims to quantify the potential impact of extreme yet plausible events or movements on the value of portfolio.

# Notes to and forming part of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

### 44.6 Derivative risk management

The Bank's derivatives risk management is performed under market risk management which is an independent unit reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The risk management policies are governed by the regulatory and internal guidelines. The risk management department of the Bank reviews credit risk, market risk and other risks associated with the derivative transactions or related area of the activity and assigns limits within which the transactions / area of activity can be carried out. Furthermore, Banks derivative portfolio is on run off basis due to conversion. Adherence to these limits is ensured through independent monitoring and control functions.

There are a number of risks undertaken by the Bank, which need to be monitored and assessed. The management of risks includes the following primary components:

- comprehensive risk measurement approach;
- detailed structure of limits, guidelines and other parameters used to govern risk taking; and
- strong management information system for controlling, monitoring and reporting risks.

Major risks associated with the derivative instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Bank uses SunGard-Sierra to measure and manage these risks which provides end-to-end capability with respect to transaction life cycle.

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the value of a derivative contract will be adversely affected by movements in equity prices, profit rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The authority for approving policies, limits and periodic reviews rest with the Board of Directors. The critical measures used to manage market risks are profit rate delta and currency delta basis. These measures involve extreme shifts in a variety of parameters, such as FX rates, profit rates, equity prices, implied volatility levels and combinations of the above. These measures are calculated through the relevant systems.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a party to a derivative contract will fail to perform its obligation. There is a settlement risk associated with the derivative transactions. Settlement risk is monitored on a daily basis. Risk management department of the Bank sets the policies and limits for counterparty risk based on a pre-defined criteria linked with the internal risk rating of the customer.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is managed as part of the overall liquidity risk of the Bank. The risk management policies related to liquidity risk are explained in note 44.5 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

Gross income generated from relevant assets, calculated at the end of the month is first divided between FBL Islamic and investors / depositors in the ratio of FBL Islamic equity commingled in a pool on pro rata basis, and then amongst FBL Islamic and the depositors as per agreed mudarib fee and weightages declared before start of a month, respectively. All Mudarabah and Musharaka based deposits are fully invested in respective Pools to produce returns for them. In case where FBL Islamic is unable to utilise all funds available for investment, priority is given to the deposit account holders.

All remunerative accounts such as saving accounts, investment certificates, business kamil accounts, etc. are opened on the basis of Mudarabah, Musharaka, Wakalah or a combination of Mudarabah and Musharaka. The return on these deposits is calculated on the basis of Profit and Loss sharing (PLS). Unless specified, all remunerative local currency and foreign currency deposits are taken as General Mudarabah and Musharaka pool.

Profit share is determined by using weightages and profit sharing ratio assigned to each category of deposit within a pool. These weightages and profit sharing ratios are declared by FBL Islamic in compliance with the requirements of the Shariah and the SBP.

The allocation (of income and expenses to different pools) is based on pre-defined basis and accounting principles / standards. The direct expenses are charged to respective pool.

# Independent Auditor's Report 

## To the members of Faysal Bank Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the annexed consolidated financial statements of Faysal Bank Limited (the Bank) and its subsidiary (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, and the consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Following is the Key Audit Matter:

| S.No. | Key Audit Matter | How the matter was addressed in our audit |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | Provision against advances: <br> (Refer notes 6.5 and 11.4 to the consolidated financial statements) |  |
|  | The Group makes provision against advances on a time-based criteria that involves ensuring that all non-performing advances are classified in accordance with the ageing criteria specified in the Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). <br> In addition to the above time-based criteria, the PRs require a subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of borrowers to determine the classification of advances. | Our audit procedures to verify provision against advances included, amongst others, the following: <br> We obtained an understanding of the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls established by the Group to identify loss events and for determining the extent of provisioning required against non-performing advances. |



<!-- Page 290 -->

| S.No. | Key Audit Matter | How the matter was addressed in our audit |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | The PRs also require the creation of general provision for certain categories of advances. <br> The Group has recognised a net reversal of provision against advances amounting to Rs. 457.485 million in the consolidated profit and loss account in the current year. As at December 31, 2022, the Group holds a provision of Rs. 19,329.026 million against advances. <br> The determination of provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgment and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgments / estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall consolidated financial statements of the Group, we considered the area of provision against advances as a key audit matter. | The testing of controls included testing of: <br> - controls over correct classification of nonperforming advances on time-based criteria; <br> - controls over monitoring of advances with higher risk of default and correct classification of nonperforming advances on subjective criteria; <br> - controls over accurate computation and recording of provisions; and <br> - controls over the governance and approval process related to provisions, including continuous reassessment by the management. <br> We selected a sample of loan accounts and performed the following substantive procedures: <br> - checked repayments of loans / mark-up installments and tested classification of nonperforming advances based on the number of days overdue; and <br> - evaluated the management's assessment for classification of a borrower's loan facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern, inspection of credit documentation and discussions with the management. <br> We checked the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances and of general provision made against performing advances as per the requirements of PRs by recomputing the provision amount in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the Prs. |

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Reports Thereon 

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.



<!-- Page 291 -->

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.



<!-- Page 292 -->

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Noman Abbas Sheikh.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

2.1 In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.
2.2 As at December 31, 2022, all the branches of the Bank are Islamic. The financial results of the Islamic banking branches of the Holding Company have been consolidated in these consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes after eliminating inter branch transactions and balances. The financial results of all Islamic banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these consolidated financial statements.

### 2.3 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Company from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Company by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Company in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company.

Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

## 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

3.1 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards applicable in Pakistan comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of, and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.
3.2 As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R\&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Holding Company to adjust the amortisation of intangible assets against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such assets identified as a result of such acquisition. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Holding Company has adjusted an amortisation of intangible assets net of tax amounting to Rs. 68.1 million (2021: Rs.50.1 million) from the NCR.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
3.3 The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS-3, 'Profit and loss sharing on deposits' for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by the SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IIFS. These reporting requirements have not been notified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these consolidated financial statements.
3.4 The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has also deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial instruments: disclosures' through its S.R.O. 633(I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
3.5 The SECP through S.R.O. 56(1)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirements of IFRS 10, 'Consolidated financial statements' are not applicable in case of investments by companies in mutual funds established under Trust Deed structure. Accordingly, implications of IFRS 10 in respect of investment in mutual funds are not considered in these consolidated financial statements.
3.6 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current year:
3.6.1 There are certain new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on January 1, 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Group's operations and are therefore not detailed in these consolidated financial statements.
3.7 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to the published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

### 3.7.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2021. SBP via same circular has finalised the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

The Holding Company will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 1, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group's financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Holding Company would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Holding Company has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

An overview of the IFRS 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP.

## Equity Securities

Equity instruments are generally measured as Fair Value through Profit \& Loss (FVPL) unless the Group elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) at initial recognition.

For equity shares held as available-for-sale (AFS) with surplus / deficit recorded in OCI, the Group may elect these equity shares as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognised in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

For those equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will be measured at fair value through profit or loss. The surplus / deficit related to these securities currently presented in equity, will be reclassified to retained earnings, with no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.



<!-- Page 302 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Unquoted equity securities are required to be measure at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation for one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

## Debt securities and loans and advances

Those debt securities that are currently classified as AFS and pass the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Holding Company's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Holding Company's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Certain debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI criteria shall be measured at FVPL regardless of the business model in which they are held.

## Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCl (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses ('ECL') resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL').

## Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Group's equity at January 1, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 600-850 million, representing corresponding impact.

The Group continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption.

In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has allowed a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting over a period of 5 years.
3.7.2 The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

## Standards, interpretations or amendments

- Narrow Scope amendments to IAS 1, Practice statement and IAS 8
- Amendment to IAS 12 - deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction
- Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases on sale and leaseback
- Amendment to IAS 1- Non current liabilities with covenants

Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)

January 1, 2023
January 1, 2023
January 1, 2024
January 1, 2024

The above amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
3.7.3 The SBP vide its Circular No. 02 of 2023 dated February 9, 2023 has specified the new reporting format for financial statements of Banking Companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements and will become applicable for the financial statements of the Bank for the quarter ending March 31, 2023.

## 4 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which have been carried at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payments and costs as disclosed in details in note 6.23 to these consolidated financial statements) and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

### 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgments in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of the accounting policies are as follows:
i) Business combinations (note 6.1);
ii) Classification, valuation and provisioning against investments (notes 6.4 and 10);
iii) Income taxes (notes $6.8,14,18$ and 32);
iv) Classification and provisioning against advances (notes 6.5 and 11);
v) Depreciation / amortisation of fixed assets / intangibles / revaluations (notes 6.6, 12 and 13);
vi) Accounting for non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (notes 6.9 and 14);
vii) Accounting for defined benefit plan (notes 6.11 and 36);
viii) Impairment of assets (note 6.7);
ix) Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities (notes 6.10 and 22);
x) Lease liability and right-of-use assets (notes $6.23,12.2,19,25$ and 29); and
xi) Fair valuation of derivatives (notes 6.19 and 23).

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## 5 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

5.1 Items included in these consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.
5.2 Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand of rupees unless otherwise stated.

## 6 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.

### 6.1 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated profit and loss account. However, as more fully described in note 13.3 to these consolidated financial statements, the gain on bargain purchase arising on an acquisition made in 2010 has been recognised directly in equity as per the directives of the SBP.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment as per the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36, 'Impairment of assets'. Impairment charge in respect of goodwill is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account and is not subsequently reversed.

Acquisition of non-controlling interests (NCI) is measured at the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired by the Group. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the proportionate share of the NCI in the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised in equity.

### 6.2 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, balances with treasury banks, balances with other banks in current and deposit accounts, national prize bonds, if any, and overdrawn nostro accounts.

### 6.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Group enters into repurchase agreement (repo) and reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

## (a) Sale of securities under repurchase agreements

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in the consolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings. The difference between the sale and contracted repurchase price is accrued over the period of the contract and recorded as an expense.

## (b) Purchase of securities under repurchase agreements

Securities purchased under agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lendings. The difference between the purchase and contracted resale price is accrued over the period of the contract and recorded as income.



<!-- Page 305 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## (c) Musharaka / Modaraba placements

In Musharaka / Modaraba, the Group invests in the Shari'ah compliant business pools of the financial institutions at the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio under musharaka agreements.

## (d) Bai Muajjal

Bai Muajjal transactions with the SBP and other financial institutions are classified under lendings. In Bai Muajjal, the Group sells Shari'ah compliant instruments on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period. The difference between the sale and the credit price is recognised over the credit period and recorded as income.

### 6.4 Investments

### 6.4.1 Classification

The Group classifies its investments as follows:

## (a) Held for trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for the purpose of generating profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices, interest rate movements, or dealer's margin or are securities included in the portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit making exists.

## (b) Held to maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and maturity that the Group has a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.

## (c) Available for sale

These are investments, other than those in associates, that do not fall under either held for trading or held to maturity categories.

## (d) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control.

### 6.4.2 Initial recognition and measurement

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by the regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the investment.

Investments other than those classified as held for trading are initially recognised at fair value which includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Investments classified as 'held for trading' are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs associated with the transactions are expensed in the consolidated profit and loss account.

### 6.4.3 Subsequent measurement:

## Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.

## Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.



<!-- Page 306 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

## Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity and is taken to the consolidated profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investments are considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. A decline in the carrying value is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, upto the cost of the investment, is credited to the consolidated profit and loss account. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

### 6.4.4 Impairment

Impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale (except term finance certificates and sukuk certificates) and held to maturity is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a listed equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. Provision for diminution in the value of term finance certificates and sukuk certificates is made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment of available for sale securities, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities on the consolidated statement of financial position within equity is removed therefrom and recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account. For investments classified as held to maturity, the impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account.

Gain or loss on sale of investments is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Premium or discount on acquisition of investments is amortised through the consolidated profit and loss account over the remaining period till maturity using the effective interest method.

### 6.4.5 Investment in associates

Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group's share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

### 6.5 Advances

6.5.1 Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Specific provision for advances is made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP which is based on the time based criteria and subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrowers. The amount of provision is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the relevant regulations. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. In addition to conventional products, the Group also offers various Islamic financing products the details of which are as follows:

## (a) Murabaha

In Murabaha transactions, the Group purchases the goods and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction.

## (b) Diminishing Musharaka

It is a form of partnership in which Group and the customer create co-ownership in the asset by purchasing it jointly. Group then rents out its share of the asset to the customer. Besides the payment of rentals, customer also

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

### 6.5.2 Net investment in finance lease

Leases where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are classified as finance lease. A receivable is recognised on the commencement of lease term at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, including guaranteed residual value, if any. Unearned finance income is recognised over the term of the lease, so as to produce a constant periodic return on the outstanding net investment in lease. Specific and general provisions for net investment in finance lease are made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP and charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.

### 6.6 Fixed assets and depreciation

## (a) Tangible assets

Operating fixed assets other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on operating fixed assets (excluding land which is not depreciated) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these consolidated financial statements after taking into account residual value, if significant. The asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if required, at each reporting date. Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account as and when incurred.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains / losses on disposal of fixed assets, if any, are taken to the consolidated profit and loss account in the period in which these arise except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to consolidated unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

## (b) Capital work-in-progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. All expenditure connected with specific assets incurred during installation and construction period are carried under this head. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

## (c) Intangible assets

Intangible assets having definite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The intangible assets include directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the intangible asset. Amortisation, except for customer relationship, is charged by applying the straight-line method over the useful



<!-- Page 309 -->

For the year ended December 31, 2022


#### Abstract

lives of the assets. Amortisation is calculated so as to write-off the assets over their expected economic lives at rates specified in note 13 to these consolidated financial statements. Amortisation is charged from the month in which the asset is available for use. No amortisation is charged for the month in which the asset is disposed of. The intangible asset comprising customer relationship is being amortised over the life expectancy of the deposits. The residual values and useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Gains and losses on disposals, if any, are taken to the consolidated profit and loss account in the period in which these arise.


### 6.7 Impairment

The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amount, except in the case of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination for which impairment is tested annually irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the consolidated profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of asset.

An impairment loss is reversed except for impairment loss relating to goodwill, if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. Such reversals are only made to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.

### 6.8 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

## Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year. Tax charge for the current year is determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation. The charge for the current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

## Prior

The charge / reversals for prior years represent adjustments to the tax charge / reversals for prior years, arising from assessments, changes in estimates, and retrospectively applied changes to the law, made during the current year.

## Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. In addition, the Group also records deferred tax asset on available tax losses. Deferred tax is calculated using the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related



<!-- Page 310 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
tax benefits will be realised.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

The Group also recognises deferred tax asset / liability on deficit / surplus on revaluation of securities, fixed assets (other than land) and assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (other than land) which is adjusted against the related deficit / surplus in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 12, 'Income Taxes'.

### 6.9 Assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying values do not differ materially from their fair values. Legal fee, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to the non-banking assets are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and these are not capitalised as part of non-banking assets. A surplus arising on revaluation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account. Any deficit arising on revaluation is first set off against the surplus account for that particular non-banking asset, if any, or if no surplus exists, is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. These assets are disclosed in other assets as specified by the SBP.

Surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

### 6.10 Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

Contingent assets are not recognised and are also not disclosed unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

### 6.11 Staff retirement benefits

## a) Defined contribution plan

The Holding Company and the Subsidiary Company both operate a contributory provident fund for all its permanent employees to which equal monthly contributions at the rate of 10 percent of basic salary are made both by the Group and the employees.

## b) Defined benefit scheme

The Holding Company operates an approved funded gratuity scheme for all its permanent eligible employees and eligible employees who are on contractual service and are employed under non-management cadre. The Subsidiary Company also operates a funded gratuity plan for all permanent eligible employees who have completed the specified minimum qualifying period of service. Contributions are made by each company to the respective funds on the basis of actuarial recommendations. Projected Unit Credit Method is used for the actuarial valuation.

Amounts arising as a result of 'Remeasurements', representing the actuarial gains and losses and the differences between the actual investment returns and the return implied by the net interest cost are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position immediately, with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the periods in which these occur.

Staff retirement benefits are payable to staff on completion of prescribed qualifying period of service under these schemes.

The particular recognition methods adopted for significant financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with these assets and liabilities.

## Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value using appropriate valuation techniques. All derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and the liability when the fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is taken to the consolidated profit and loss account.

## Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are set off and the net amount is reported in the consolidated financial statements only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off and the Group intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expense items of such assets and liabilities are also offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated financial statements only when permitted by the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

### 6.20 Earnings per share

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Holding Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, if any.

## (b) Geographical segment

### 6.22 Provision of claims under guarantees

A provision for claim under guarantees is recognised when intimated and reasonable certainty exists that the Group will settle the obligation. The charge to the consolidated profit and loss account is stated net of expected recoveries as the obligation is recognised in other liabilities.

### 6.23 Lease liability and right-of-use assets

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are presented within note 12 and are subject to impairment in line with the Group's policy as described in note 6.7.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

### 6.24 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity and recognised at their face value. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

### 6.25 Reserves

Reserves being held by the Group in these consolidated financial statements include the following;

- Non- distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase option (note 3.2).
- Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
12.2.2 The Group's freehold / leasehold land and buildings on freehold / leasehold land were last revalued by Joseph Lobo Co. (Private) Limited and K. G. Traders (Private) Limited on December 31, 2022 on the basis of professional assessments of the market values.

Had there been no revaluation, the carrying amount of revalued assets as at December 31, 2022 would have been Rs 5,069.59 million (2021: Rs 4,775.54 million).
12.2.3 Allocation of depreciation expense of the year is as follows:

### 12.2.4 Lease modifications

During the current year, the Group has renegotiated a number of existing lease agreements resulting in a modification of these lease agreements under IFRS 16, 'Leases'. These lease modifications pertain to:
i) a change in consideration of the lease(s);
ii) an increase in the scope of the lease(s) due to an extension in the contractual lease terms; or
iii) termination of existing lease(s) due to relocation of the branches to new premises.

In case of (i) and (ii) above, the Group has remeasured the lease liabilities by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rates and making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets.

In case of (iii) above, the Group has decreased the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities to reflect the full termination of the lease, taking any resultant gain or loss on such termination to the consolidated profit and loss account.

13.2.2 This represents an intangible asset (customer relationship) which comprises of core deposits which were recognised at the time of acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. These core deposits represent the funding benefit that would be available to the Holding Company on account of availability of funding through deposit customers rather than from the wholesale or interbank market. This benefit also considers the fact that the economic life time of these deposits is longer than their contractual life. Based on this assumption, this intangible asset had been valued using certain valuation techniques and is being amortised over the life expectancy of these deposits. As more fully explained in note 13.3 to these consolidated financial statements, the SBP allowed the Holding Company to adjust the amortisation charge arising on this intangible asset against non-distributable capital reserve. The remaining amortisation period of this intangible asset is ranging from 3 to 8 years.

### 13.3 Non-distributable capital reserve - gain on bargain purchase

As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R\&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as non-distributable capital reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Holding Company to adjust the amortisation of the intangible asset against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such asset. Accordingly, the Holding Company has adjusted amortisation of intangible asset amounting to Rs 68.149 million (2021: Rs. 50.1 million) (net of tax) from the non-distributable capital reserve.

### 22.3.3 Subsidiary Company:

(i) The income tax returns of the Company for the tax years 2004 to 2022 (financial year ended June 30, 2004 to December 31, 2021) have been filed and are deemed to have been assessed under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, unless selected by the taxation authorities for audit purposes. The tax year 2005 (financial year ended June 30, 2005) has been selected by the taxation authorities for audit purpose. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 0.913 million for the tax year 2005 on account of apportionment of expenses and disallowance of certain expenses. The Subsidiary Company has paid Rs. 0.414 million and has filed an appeal against the order before the Commissioner Appeals, the proceedings of which are underway. The remaining tax liability on these matters is Rs. 0.498 million. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.
(ii) The income tax department has issued orders and show cause notices under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for recovery of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) aggregating to Rs 0.818 million in respect of tax years 2008 and 2013. The details of orders and show cause along with the management actions are listed below:

| Tax years | Order / show <br> cause references | Status | WWF demand <br> Rupees '000 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 2008 | Order u/s 221 <br> dated June 30, <br> 2014 | Appeal pending before the Commissioner Appeals | 315 |
| 2013 | Show cause u/s <br> 221 dated May 7, <br> 2014 | Showcause notice has been responded to | 503 |

The management is of the view that WWF was not applicable for tax year 2008. In tax year 2013, subsequent to clarification decision by the SHC, the management has not admitted WWF charge in the annual return of income. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.
(iii) The Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice No. PRA/AM/61/2205/ dated March 12, 2014 to Faysal Asset Management Limited requiring the Company to obtain registration / enrolment and to pay sales tax amounting to Rs. 6.055 million from July 2013 to March 2014 under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 with effect from May 22, 2013 on management fee earned in Punjab.

In respect of this, the Subsidiary Company, jointly with other Asset Management Companies together with their respective collective investment schemes through their trustees, has filed a petition on July 8, 2014 in the SHC challenging the above notice. The Court has ordered suspension of the show cause notice till the next hearing of appeal in their order dated July 10, 2014. The next date of hearing has not yet been decided. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.
(iv) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2013 (financial year ended June 30, 2013) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 4.964 million for the tax year 2013 on account of apportionment of expenses, salary expenses and hardware and software expense. The management filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. The CIR(A) remanded back a few expenses while ordered against various other expenses for which the Subsidiary Company has decided to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

For the year ended December 31, 2022
(v) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.7 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.
(vi) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) passed an order under section 182(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax year 2018, whereby the DCIR imposed a penalty of Rs. 0.833 million on account of non submission of statement required to be filed by the Subsidiary Company under bilateral or multilateral convention under section 165B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. On August 17, 2020, the management filed an appeal before the CIR(A) on the subject matter and paid an amount of Rs 0.083 million being $10 \%$ of the total amount of penalty imposed under the order and thus obtained an automatic stay on the subject matter. As on June 15, 2021 the Subsidiary Company has received an appellate order from the CIR(A), dismissing the appeal filed by the Company on August 17, 2020. The management has filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). As a matter of abundant caution the Subsidiary Company had recognised a provision for the remaining amount of Rs. 0.749 million in these consolidated financial statements.
(vii) During the year ended December 31, 2022, one of the customers of the Company has claimed an amount of Rs 245 million from the Subsidiary Company for loss of profit and principal against amount kept by him in discretionary portfolio and CIS with the Subsidiary Company.

The Subsidiary Company based on an internal assessment and legal opinion is confident that no likely claim will be payable by the Subsidiary Company. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements in respect of this claim.

### 22.4 Commitments to extend credits

The Holding Company makes commitments to extend credit (including to related parties) in the normal course of its business but these being revocable commitments do not attract any significant penalty or expense if the facilities are unilaterally withdrawn except for Rs. 15,473 million (2021: Rs. 31,655 million) which are irrevocable in nature.

### 36.11 Sensitivity analysis

The analysis based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the consolidated statement of financial position. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption is summarised below:

### 36.16 Funding policy

The policy followed by the Group in respect of the staff retirement benefit schemes is disclosed in note 6.11 to these consolidated financial statements.

### 36.17 The gratuity scheme exposes the Group to the following risks:

## Asset volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Fund is invested in mutual funds and Ijarah Sukuk. The investment is almost 18.43\% (Rs. 299 million) for mutual funds while $54.51 \%$ (Rs. 886 million) for Ijarah Sukuk. The funds have no such investment in any Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds hence the asset volatility risk is lower.

## Changes in bond yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. Any increase in bond yields will lower the gratuity liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

## Inflation risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Group.

## Life expectancy / withdrawal rate

The gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60 . The life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Group for the purpose of the Gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post-retirement benefit been given by the Group like monthly pension, post-retirement medical, etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions. In this case, it is not a significant risk.

## Other risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallise. These include:

- retention risk - the risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.
- final salary risk - the risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- model risk - the defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the gratuity fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- operational risk related to a separate entity - retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Group. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Group are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- compliance risk - the risk that retirement benefits offered by the Group do not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- legal / political risk - the risk that the legal / political environment changes and the Group is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Group has projected.

## 39 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

### 39.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Pakistan Investment Bonds / <br> Market Treasury Bills | Fair values of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Treasury Bills are derived using the PKRV / PKFRV rates. |
| Ijarah Sukuk | Fair values of GoP Ijarah Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market <br> Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre- <br> defined / approved dealers / brokers. |
| Unlisted ordinary shares | Break-up value is determined on the basis of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the company using the latest <br> available audited financial statements. |
| Term Finance Certificates <br> (TFCs) and Sukuk <br> Certificates | Fair values of TFCs and Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates. |
| Forward foreign exchange <br> contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the <br> State Bank of Pakistan. |
| Derivative instruments | The Holding Company enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are <br> valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, cross <br> currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation <br> techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. |
| Mutual funds | Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds <br> Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). |

## Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 3

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Fixed assets (land and buildings) | Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the <br> accounting policy disclosed in note 6.6. |
| Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in <br> satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy <br> disclosed in note 6.9. |

*These represent shares of Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan which have been carried at cost since their fair value is not considered to be materially different from its carrying amount. Accordingly, the disclosures with respect to level 3 financial assets have not been given.

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Group which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Group's properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.

## 44 RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management group (RMG) has been organised under the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). It has been authorised by the Board of Directors (BoD) to monitor the implementation of various risk policies via implementation of an integrated risk management framework across the Holding Company. As an ongoing exercise to integrate risk related functions, RMG has been expanded, strengthened and entrusted to monitor the risk areas across the organisation, including adoption and convergence towards regulatory and Basel guidelines on risk management.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organisation flows to ensure that risks are timely and accurately identified and assessed, properly documented, approved and adequately monitored and managed in order to ensure that risk taking activities are in line with the guidelines approved by the BoD and to protect the interests of the Group's depositors and shareholders.

The 'risk management framework' at the Group encompasses:

- scope of risks to be managed;
- process, systems and procedures to manage risk; and
- roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk management.

The Group has adopted an approach that gives an integrated view of the risks faced by the organisation. This calls for aligning strategic vision, policy objectives and business processes / procedures within the risk management framework. The management of risk is integrated with the Group's management of capital and strategy. This ensures that risks taken in pursuit of the Group's strategic objectives are consistent with the policies, translating into targeted shareholder return as well as the Group's desired credit rating and risk appetite.

With this in view, the risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guidelines to cater to changing business dynamics. The risk management framework includes:

- clearly defined risk management policies;
- well constituted organisational structure; and
- mechanism for ongoing review of all policies and procedures and risk exposures.



<!-- Page 361 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
The 'risk management framework' is built on the following elements:

- comprehensive risk governance; and
- effective risk processes.

The Group has developed and implemented a governance and management structure, processes surrounding each risk area, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, capital management, operational risk, environmental risk and information security risk.

The essential components which contribute in effective management of all these risks are as follows:

- active board / senior management strategic direction and centralised RMG oversight;
- sufficient policies, procedures and limits;
- adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and
- comprehensive internal controls.

The Board of Directors (BoD) monitoring and oversight is facilitated through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), comprising of directors including the President \& CEO. It is appointed and authorised by the BoD to assist in the design, regular evaluation and timely updation of the risk management framework. The BRMC has further authorised management committees such as Country Credit Committee (CCC), Agriculture Credit Committee (ACC), Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) to supervise risk management activities within their respective areas.

In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with business, RMG has separate risk management functions for credit risk management, based on the specialised skill sets and required specific experience in various business segments. These functions comprise of corporate risk, CBSME, agri and retail risk management.

The common responsibilities of all credit risk management functions include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with compliance department of the Holding Company to ensure conformity to the relevant Government regulations, the SBP PRs as well as internal policies.
- work with relationship teams to structure exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure adequate risk coverage.

The risk management architecture is further fostered by enterprise risk management, risk policy \& analytics, information security function and an independent credit administration department.

The enterprise risk management function is responsible for managing and controlling market, operational and liquidity risks at an enterprise level and monitoring regulatory capital requirements of the Group.

Credit administration department - independent from the Risk Management function - looks after the security, loan documentation, disbursement and post disbursement monitoring aspects of the credit portfolio.

Risk policy and analytics department serves as an independent check in the risk management function. It performs periodic review of all credit related portfolios (corporate, CBSME, retail, agri, SAM) and analyses portfolio compositions, risk rating distributions, emerging trends of NPLs, renewal status of Risk Approvals (RAs) as per policy and other policy related matters. It also formulates / updates credit policies (along with various limits prescribed therein) in line with regulatory environment, business strategy, the BoD approvals and the best practices.

The information security risk function is responsible for information security risk identification, monitoring and reporting.

### 44.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that a counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Group due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct lending activities as well as contingent liabilities.

The Group's credit risk philosophy is based on the Group's overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Group is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analysed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities, appropriately rated, appropriately structured, appropriately priced and documented.

The Group deals with many different types of borrowers and borrowing structures across the corporate, commercial, SME, agriculture and retail segments. The Group manages customer credit risk exposures within appropriate limits to ensure that it does not provide a disproportionate level of credit to a single customer or group of connected clients. The Group follows aggregation principles - summing of credit risk limits to the same customer, or group of connected clients - to identify and manage effectively all significant credit risk exposures to a single customer within an individual business and, where appropriate, across other business segments.

The Group has well-defined credit approval and review processes under which senior officers with the requisite credit background, critically scrutinise, advise and discuss associated risks and recommend / review / approve credit facilities and financing, through respective credit committees. Besides financial, industry and transaction analysis, in order to quantify risks of counterparty, the credit evaluation also includes risk rating system to evaluate risk rating of the customers which is then monitored on a portfolio basis to gauge the Group's credit portfolio quality. To avoid risk concentration, counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

With a view to develop and effectively manage a diversified credit portfolio within each business segment (as an integral part of the credit risk management process), the Group has adopted the concept of an industry / sector-wise exposure concentration grid which dictates target market exposures.

As part of the Group's portfolio strategy and planning activity, these industry concentration limits are continually overseen by the management against the Group's approved exposures in these sectors and reviewed by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) in its meetings with an aim to monitor the overall risk and to avoid high exposure to a single group or industry.

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody's and S\&P Global lowered the country's sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained volatile through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of $27.32 \%$ in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to $16 \%$. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

The Group is regularly conducting credit portfolio reviews to assess early warning signs, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. The Group is confident that it has adequate capacity to withstand these difficult times.

### 44.1.1 Segment by class of business

Credit Risk Management (CRM) Framework (non-retail / non-individual portfolio) covers three business segments: corporate risk management, commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management and retail risk management. Based on overall guidance provided by a recognised and established external consultant, in line with the global best practices while ensuring regulatory compliance and alleviation of any (perceived) conflict of interest, credit management process has been segregated into two distinct categories:



<!-- Page 363 -->

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

- independent risk advice by risk management function.
- credit approvals by credit committee(s), while taking into consideration the business unit recommendations / approvals and independent risk advice.

With this segregation, the role of risk management function in credit approval process is focused to provide risk advice only, based on key risk parameters; whereas relevant credit committees are responsible for providing credit related approvals.

The common responsibilities of corporate risk management and commercial banking and SME (including agri) risk management include:

- conduct a thorough and an independent due diligence of the proposed / existing exposures in the respective risk portfolios.
- work with relationship teams to advise on structure of exposures such that they mitigate key risks, cater to customer requirements, remain economical in terms of risk weighted assets / capital allocation to ensure risk coverage.
- work with the independent credit risk review team (under internal audit) for effective and periodic review of the credit portfolio.

Retail risk management is responsible for managing the credit risk of consumer finance credit products, with credit facilities extended to individual (non-corporate) customers. The consumer finance / retail finance function operates on a program approach, which are approved by the Country Credit Committee and subsequently by the BoD. The retail risk management provides its input on risk parameters in term of 'risk advice', at the time of approval / changes in product programs. The retail risk management also ensures that all the ongoing individual credit approvals are within pre-defined risk parameters as per the approved product programs.

### 44.1.2 Credit risk: general disclosures Basel specific

The Group has adopted the standardised approach under Basel. According to the regulatory statement submitted under the standardised approach, the portfolio has been divided into claims on public sector entities in Pakistan (PSEs), claims on corporate (excluding equity exposure) and claims categorised as retail portfolio. Claims on corporate constitute $60.56 \%$ (2021: $65.71 \%$ ) of the total credit risk weighted assets, $1.00 \%$ (2021: $1.81 \%$ ) represents claims on PSEs and $15.42 \%$ (2021: $14.62 \%$ ) exposure pertains to claims categorised as retail portfolio.

### 44.1.3 Credit risk: disclosures for portfolio subject to standardised approach

For domestic claims, external credit assessment institutions (ECAls) recommended by the SBP, namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and VIS Credit Rating Company Limited are used. For claims on foreign entities, ratings assigned by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody's are used. Exposures not rated by any of the aforementioned rating agencies are categorised as unrated.

| Exposures | PACRA | VIS | Standard <br> and Poor's | Moody's | Fitch |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Corporate | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | - | - | - |

| Sovereigns | - | - | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| PSEs | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | - | - | - |

The SBP's indicative mapping process as instructed in the SBP's circular "Minimum capital requirements for banks and DFIs" (indicated in table below) was used to map alpha numeric ratings of PACRA, VIS, S\&P's. Moody's, Fitch ratings, and numeric scores of ECAs, to the SBP's rating grades.

### 44.2 Market Risk

It is the risk that the value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions of the Group will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as benchmark rates, deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and / or commodity prices resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. Market risks arise generally from trading activities, open foreign currency positions, holding common equity and other products. All such instruments and transactions are exposed to general and specific market movements.

The Group seeks to mitigate market risk by employing strategies that correlate price, rate and spread movements of its earning assets, liabilities and trading activities.

### 44.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk / currency risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movements in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency positions. Changes in currency rates affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect revenues from foreign exchange dealing.

The Group undertakes currency risk mostly to support its trade services and maintains overall foreign exchange risk position to the extent of statutory Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) prescribed by the SBP.

Exposure limits such as counterparty, gap, net open position, dealer and bucket-wise currency delta limits are in place in accordance with the Bank's approved policies in order to manage associated risk and concentration at the acceptable tolerance levels.

### 44.2.3 Equity position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk arising from unfavourable fluctuations in prices of shares in which the Group carries positions. It is a risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in the value of equity related portfolios of the Group. Price risk associated with equities could be systematic or unsystematic. Systematic risk is due to sensitivity of portfolio's value to changes in overall level of equity prices, while unsystematic risk is associated with price volatility that is determined by the specific characteristics of the investee company.

The Group's equity position is governed by position limits imposed by the SBP for overall investment and per scrip exposure. Additionally, there are internal limits set to manage overall earnings in the form of stop loss limits and maintain a diverse portfolio through sector concentration limits.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Yield curve risk is the risk that a financial instrument will suffer either a decline in income or capital because future changes in prevailing intrest rates impact assets more or less than they impact liabilities.

The intrest rate risk of the Group arises when there is a mismatch between contractual maturities, which are subject to intrest rate adjustment within a specified period or re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Risk is addressed by Asset and Liability Management Committee that reviews the intrest rate dynamics at regular intervals and decides re-pricing of assets and liabilities to ensure that the spread of the Group remains at an acceptable level.

Major sources of intrest rate risk are;
i) differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk);
ii) changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting the Group's activities (basis risk);
iii) changing rate relationships across the range of maturities (yield curve risk);
iv) intrest-related options embedded in the Group's products (options risk); and
v) changes in marked-to-market value of financial instruments which occur when intrest rate changes (price risk).

### 44.3 Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors or from external events. The Group businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and losses originate from business / operational process failure, IT security failure, natural disasters, dependence on key suppliers, fraud, service quality compromises, regulatory non-compliance, loss of key staff and social and environmental impacts.

The operational risk management function is primarily responsible for the oversight of operational risk management across the Group. The operational risk management framework of the Group is governed by the operational risk management policy and procedures, while the implementation is supported by an operational risk management system and designated operational risk coordinators within different units across the Group. The framework is in line with international best practices, flexible enough to implement in stages and permits the overall approach to evolve in response to organizational learning and future requirements.

The Group has implemented an effective operational risk management framework for managing operational risk. Each department has processes and system controls in place to address operational risks within their area. Operational loss data is collected through a well defined program implemented across the Group. Periodic workshops are conducted for risk and control self assessment and key risk exposures are identified and assessed against existing controls to evaluate improvement opportunities. Key risk indicators are also defined for monitoring of risk exposures. New products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments, before implementation. Regular updates on operational risk status is presented to Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and the Board of Directors through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

## Operational risk-disclosures Basel II specific

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Group is currently using basic indicator approach for calculating operational risk capital charge.
Under basic indicator approach the capital charge for operational risk is a fixed percentage (denoted alpha) of average positive annual gross income of the Group over the past three years. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero, should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average.

### 44.4 Shariah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR)

Shariah Non-Compliance Risk (SNCR) is the risk that arises from a Group's failure to comply with the Shariah rules and principles prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan and Shariah Board of the Bank. Managing Shariah non-compliance risk is vital for the establishment of an effective Shariah governance system. Shariah compliance is critical to an Islamic Group's operations and such compliance requirements must permeate throughout the organization and its products and activities.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Faysal Bank Limited (FBL), being converted into Islamic Bank is fully aware of the importance and implication of Shariah non-compliance risk on its business and strategy and therefore, ensures Shariah compliance in its business activities \& operations. FBL has also developed a comprehensive framework for Shariah Non-Compliance Risk management, which entails identification, assessment, monitoring / controlling and reporting of SNCR residing in the Bank.

### 44.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due and to replenish funds when they are withdrawn.

Liquidity risk management framework is governed by the liquidity risk management policy. The policy provides specific directives for measuring and managing liquidity risk identifies responsible personnel; and defines their respective roles and responsibilities relating to liquidity risk management.

The management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BoD)
- Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)
- Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO)
- Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)
- Treasury
- Risk management (enterprise risk management)
- Finance

The BoD approves the liquidity risk management policy including risk limits and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the BRMC, that the Group's liquidity risk is being managed prudently. The BRMC plays a strategic role in liquidity risk management by overseeing the liquidity risk profile of the Group. ERMC defines the risk tolerance levels and setting risk limits for effective liquidity risk management. ALCO ensures adherence with policy requirements and risk limits so that the Group remains sufficiently liquid at all times.

The market and liquidity risk under enterprise risk management function overseas liquidity risk. The Group's Asset and Liability Committee manages the liquidity position on a continuous basis.

The Group ensures to maintain a diversified portfolio of liquid assets and funding base. Sources of funding comprise of a good mix of core deposits. Concentration in deposit, especially large volume deposits, is closely monitored to anticipate any potential liquidity issues in case of their withdrawals.

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like liquid assets to liquid liabilities, liquid assets to total deposits, large volume deposits to total deposits, advances to deposit, liquid assets to volatile funding; on a regular basis against defined limits. Further, liquidity gaps over different time bands, are also monitored through maturity profiling of assets and liabilities. The Group also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times. In addition, the Group has also implemented the SBP's Basel III liquidity standards for ensuring compliance with the requirements of LCR, NSFR and other monitoring tools.

The Group performs liquidity stress testing on periodic basis in order to ensure sufficient liquidity is always available to meet financial obligations / commitments. Stress testing aims to quantify the potential impact of extreme yet plausible events or movements on the value of portfolio. Shocks include withdrawal of deposits, withdrawal of wholesale / large deposits, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. The results of liquidity stress testing are shared with relevant authorities / committees, on periodic basis.

Contingency funding plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk management policy of the Group. CFP provides a set of several early warning indicators of a possible liquidity shortfall situation; describes the actions to be taken to manage it and identifies the roles and responsibilities of ALCO, CFP team or other relevant authorities.

# Notes to and forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2022

### 44.6 Derivative risk management

The Group's derivatives risk management is performed under market risk management which is an independent unit reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The risk management policies are governed by the regulatory and internal guidelines. The risk management department of the Group reviews credit risk, market risk and other risks associated with the derivative transactions or related area of the activity and assigns limits within which the transactions / area of activity can be carried out. Furthermore, Group's derivative portfolio is on run off basis due to conversion. Adherence to these limits is ensured through independent monitoring and control functions.

There are a number of risks undertaken by the Group, which need to be monitored and assessed. The management of risks includes the following primary components:

- comprehensive risk measurement approach;
- detailed structure of limits, guidelines and other parameters used to govern risk taking; and

These measures involve extreme shifts in a variety of parameters, such as FX rates, profit rates, equity prices, implied volatility levels and combinations of the above. These measures are calculated through the relevant systems.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a party to a derivative contract will fail to perform its obligation. There is a settlement risk associated with the derivative transactions. Settlement risk is monitored on a daily basis. Risk management department of the Group sets the policies and limits for counterparty risk based on a pre-defined criteria linked with the internal risk rating of the customer.

All Mudarabah and Musharaka based deposits are fully invested in respective Pools to produce returns for them. In case where FBL Islamic is unable to utilise all funds available for investment, priority is given to the deposit account holders.

All remunerative accounts such as saving accounts, investment certificates, business kamil accounts, etc. are opened on the basis of Mudarabah, Musharaka, Wakalah or a combination of Mudarabah and Musharaka. The return on these deposits is calculated on the basis of Profit and Loss sharing (PLS). Unless specified, all remunerative local currency and foreign currency deposits are taken as General Mudarabah and Musharaka pool.
