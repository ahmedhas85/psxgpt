Directors’ Review
# Directors’ Review

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of Bank Alfalah Limited for the period ended September 30, 2022.

# Economic Review

Global growth remained subdued in the first half of 2022 despite easing COVID-19 restrictions and normalcy returning across most countries. Key impediments to growth were higher than expected inflation worldwide, global output contraction, climate change impact, tighter financial conditions and spillovers from the war in Ukraine. These challenges continue to impact global economies including Pakistan.

Recession fears grow as Central Banks around the globe increase rates in order to counter decades-high inflation led by commodity super-cycle and supply chain disruptions. Commodities are getting softer but concerns of commodity importing countries remain as the US Dollar appreciates.

While Pakistan’s economy was grappling with these global macro-economic developments, recent floods added another series of challenges for Pakistan worsening supply shock and the fiscal burden, and hampering GDP growth. Encouragingly, Pakistan recently concluded an IMF deal (release of the USD 1.2 billion loan tranche) and pledge of support from donor countries/organization to recover from the flooding loss. However, the need is much greater than the commitment made by the international agencies and donors.

Inflation continued surging in Pakistan because of PKR devaluation, energy pass-through and supply shock triggered by the floods. It peaked in Aug-22 touching 27.3%, a multi-decade high, before declining to 23.2% in Sep-22, translating into average 9M CY2022 reading of 18% compared to 9.0% in SPLY. Though inflation is expected to have already reached its peak, the reading is likely to stay elevated for the next few months, before it starts to taper off in the latter half of FY2022-23. Soft commodity prices remain the silver lining and any significant decline in energy and other commodities can lower inflation expectations.

Import, consumption control and belt tightening measures have started to reflect on Balance on Payments. Current Account Deficit has reduced by 19% to USD 1.9 billion in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal year. Trade Deficit which increased by 38% in FY22 to USD 39.6 billion, has now declined by 11% in 2M FY23 to USD 6.0 billion. Similarly, Services Deficit also shrank by 10% to USD 0.6 billion. Remittances, on the other hand, reduced by 3% to USD 5.2 billion in 2M FY23.

First half of 2022 saw a steep decline of forex reserves which have now stabilized at around USD 14 billion, post resumption of IMF program. Since Dec-21, forex reserves have declined from USD 23.9 billion to USD 13.8 billion as on Sep 23, 2022. As a result, Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar (22.7% in 9M 2022) with increasing volatility in 3Q. In addition to domestic reasons, part of PKR depreciation is because of the appreciating US Dollar due to continual monetary tightening in the US. Responding to the challenges, SBP increased the Policy Rate by a cumulative 800bps to 15.00% since September 2021.

Keeping in view increased government liquidity risk and external vulnerability, Moody’s Investor Service revised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating downwards by one notch to Caa1 from B3, citing that the floods could raise Pakistan’s external financing needs, increasing the risk of a Balance of Payments crisis. The Ministry of Finance refuted Moody’s unilateral action citing that the Government policies over the last few months have helped in fiscal consolidation and the Government had adequate liquidity and financing arrangements to meet its external liabilities.

Fiscal side remains challenging and the Deficit clocked in at 7.9% of GDP during FY 2022. Recently announced austerity measures in the Federal Budget and resumption of the IMF program are steps in the right direction. However, the rehabilitation costs for flood impact are likely to keep the Fiscal Deficit elevated and might require further adjustments in fiscal targets.

Pakistan benchmark KSE-100 index fell 7.8% during 9M 2022 as a result of deteriorating global and local macro-economic indicators. Efforts to control imports and expenditures have started to bear fruit in the shape of demand slowdown and improvement in the Trade Balance. Visible improvements on the diplomatic front are an encouraging sign and reflect ongoing efforts by the Government to improve foreign ties and arrange much needed funding, particularly to rehabilitate flood affected regions. These developments are promising but continuity of economic discipline, sustainability of policies, and reforms are essential for sustainable economic growth.

Bank Alfalah kept up its growth momentum in third quarter with profit after tax being Rs 14.090 billion which is 34.4% higher than same period last year. The growth in profit before tax of 61.7% helped absorb the impact of one-time super tax imposed by the Federal Government. The Earning Per Share (EPS) for the nine months stands at Rs. 7.93 (Sep 2021: Rs. 5.90).

The revenue increased by 57.1% as compared to same period last year (SPLY). Markup income grew significantly by 58.6%. Well positioned ALM book along with strong earning assets growth led to this growth. Non-markup income stood at Rs. 17.456 billion, higher by 52.8% from SPLY; growth was visible in all non-fund-based income lines with exception of capital gains due to rapid increase in the discount rates by the central Bank to curb inflation. FX income increased on back of better trade and remittance flows and higher spreads. Dividend income doubled due to better corporate earnings.

Our Fee and commission income showed a robust growth of 36.6% year on year (YoY). Significant contributions are from branch banking fee due to increase in business activity and number of customers. Combined debit and credit card spend increased by 51% with travel, grocery and dining spend remaining robust. Card acquiring income doubled due to phenomenal increase in e-commerce spend and POS merchant sale value – the Bank leads the market with 55% of e-comm and 30% of POS transactions share. Trade, guarantees and remittance income also increased on back of significant volume growth – the Bank handles second highest remittance flow in the country. Robust increase in digital transactions volume and resumption of charges on interbank fund transfers led to increase in alternate delivery channel income.

The Bank continues to keep a check on expenses and manage costs prudently while focusing on building revenue momentum through expansion without compromising on investments in new ventures. The impact of new branches, investment in digital technologies and information technology platforms, professional consultancies, higher marketing costs, PKR depreciation and inflation related effects mainly led to an increase in operating expenses. During current period, the Bank opened 67 (2021: 60) new branches, which are helping us in customer acquisition, deposit mobilization and hence revenue growth. The Bank is also investing in digital technologies with a focus on areas where we can deepen our relationships and gain market share. The best evidence of that success is our market share growth over the last three years.

The Bank’s cost to income ratio improved to 49.0% as against 58.5% SPLY, taking support from strong revenue growth.

The Bank’s deposits closed at Rs. 1.385 trillion at the end of Sep’22, with YoY growth of 33.7%. We continue to outpace the industry in total deposits growth. The current accounts grew by 29.8% YoY. This is reflective of the Bank’s well thought and applied strategy of increasing its market share.

The Bank grew loans by 15.3% YoY, while maintaining credit discipline. The growth is reflective of the Bank’s strategy to focus on consumer finance, SME lending and penetration in digital lending space. Despite challenging market fundamentals, the Bank’s credit performance was quite strong during the current year. As at the period end, our gross advances to deposits ratio (ADR) stood at 56.1%, much higher than 50% on which higher income tax rate becomes applicable. Our underwriting discipline and rigorous client selection continued to serve us well which reflects in our non-performing loans ratio which stood at 4.1%. This is despite some prudent classifications. Further non-performing loans remain fully covered with coverage being 103.9%.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017.
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017.
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the ICAP and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS).

SBP has directed banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2023 vide BPRD circular no. 03 dated July 05, 2022.

Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements; except for overseas branches where such standards are applicable.

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 39 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

The disclosures made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated March 22, 2019 and IAS 34. These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual unconsolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

22.2.4.1 These represent commitments that are irrevocable because they cannot be withdrawn at the discretion of the Bank without the risk of incurring significant penalty or expense.

# 22.3 Other contingent liabilities

| 7,122,967 | 4,823,035 |

# 22.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of collateral assets (such as hypothecated / mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), damage to reputation and cases filed by Ex. employees of the Bank for damages. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessment, management is confident that the matters will be decided in Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these financial statements.

# 22.4 Contingency for tax payable

# 22.4.1 There were no tax related contingencies other than as disclosed in note 33.1.

WORKERS' WELFARE FUND


The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers' Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers' Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 35.2

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current period.

# 35.3

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 35.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non government debt securities.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.

(c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3 except as disclosed in 35.3.2. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 35.3.2 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of fixed assets (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 12 and 15. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan.

# 39.9 PLS Pool Management- Islamic Banking Group (IBG)

# 39.9.1 The pools, their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The profit and loss sharing between the Rabbul Maal (depositor) and Mudarib (Bank - IBG) is based upon the underlying principles of Mudaraba, where Bank also contributes its equity to general pool of funds, and becomes the capital provider.

Currently IBG is managing following pools:

1. General Pool for LCY Depositors
2. FCY Pool for Foreign Currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs Pool for Treasury Purposes
4. IERS Pool for Islamic Export Refinance Scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based Remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Advances, Investments, and Placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the Weightage system.

The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under SBP IERS Scheme. The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

The bank remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.

QUARTERLY REPORT SEPTEMBER 30, 2022




Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the ICAP and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Further, SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. SBP has directed banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2023 vide BPRD circular no. 03 dated July 05, 2022.

Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements; except for overseas branches, subsidiary and associates where such standards are applicable.

# 2.2.1  Basis of consolidation

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those return through its power over the investee.

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of subsidiary from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Associates are those entities on which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Associates as well as investment in mutual funds established under trust structure are accounted for using the equity method.

Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary which are not owned by the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

# 2.2.2  Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 39 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.2.3  Disclosures

The disclosures made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated March 22, 2019 and IAS 34. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

# 2.2.4  Going concern

The Group company believes that there is no significant doubt on the Group company's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.

# 2.3  Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Group's operations and therefore not detailed in these consolidated financial statements.

| - | ------------------ | ----------------- |
|   | 7,122,967          | 4,823,035         |

74 BANK ALFALAH


# WORKERS' WELFARE FUND



The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers' Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers' Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

# QUARTERLY REPORT SEPTEMBER 30, 2022




In respect of tax years 2008, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the tax authorities have raised certain issues including default in payment of WWF, allocation of expenses to dividend and capital gains, dividend income from mutual funds not being taken under income from business and disallowance of Leasehold improvements resulting in tax demand of Rs. 336.549 million net of relief provided in appeal (December 31, 2021: Rs. 714.263). Bank has filed appeals on these issues which are pending before Commissioner Appeals. The management is confident that these matters will be decided in favour of the Bank and consequently has not made any provision in respect of these amounts.

b) The Bank has received orders from a provincial tax authority for the periods from July 2011 to December 2020 wherein tax authority demanded sales tax on banking services and penalty amounting to Rs. 763.312 million [excluding default surcharge] (December 31, 2021: Rs. 763.312 million) by disallowing certain exemptions of sales tax on banking services and allegedly for short payment of sales tax. Appeals against these orders are pending before Commissioner Appeals. The Bank has not made any provision against these orders and the management is of the view that these matters will be settled in Bank's favour through appellate process.

c) During the period, bank has received an order from a tax authority wherein Sales tax and penalty amounting to Rs.5.191 million [excluding default surcharge] is demanded allegedly for non-payment of sales tax on certain transactions relating to accounting year 2016.

Bank is in the process of filing appeal against recent order whereas bank's appeal against earlier order is pending before Commissioner Appeals.

# 36 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 36.2

The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer, occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current period.

# 36.3

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 36.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

- (a) Financial instruments in level 1
Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and Non government debt securities.
- (b) Financial instruments in level 2
Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.
- (c) Financial instruments in level 3
Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3 except as disclosed in 36.3.2. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 36.3.2 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of fixed assets (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 10 and 13. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by Bank which are also on panel of State Bank of Pakistan.

The board and management of the Bank continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to country's frozen reserves and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The bank remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.
