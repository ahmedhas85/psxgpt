# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

# Unconsolidated Financial Statements

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the unaudited condensed interim financial statements of Faysal Bank Limited (“FBL” or “the Bank”) for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

# Company Profile

FBL was incorporated in Pakistan on October 03, 1994, as a public limited company and its shares are listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange. FBL offers a wide range of Islamic banking services to all customer segments, i.e., Retail, Small & Medium Sized Enterprises, Commercial, Agri-based, and Corporate.

The Bank surrendered its conventional banking license on 31 December 2023 and effective 01 January 2023 it began its fully shariah-compliant operations under an Islamic Banking License issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). It’s footprint spreads over 340 cities across the country with 855 branches offering sharia-compliant banking services.

# Holding Company

Ithmaar Bank B.S.C (closed), a banking entity regulated by the Central Bank of Bahrain, is the parent company holding directly and indirectly 66.78% (2024: 66.78%) of the Bank’s shares. Ithmaar Bank B.S.C. (closed) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ithmaar Holdings B.S.C. Dar Al-Maal Al-Islami Trust (DMIT) is the holding entity of Ithmaar Holding B.S.C. and the ultimate parent Company of the Bank. DMIT was formed by an indenture under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas for the purpose of conducting business affairs in conformity with Islamic laws, principles, and traditions.

# Economic Update

Pakistan’s economy in the first quarter of 2025 reflected a mix of encouraging signs and lingering challenges. Encouragingly, inflation reached historic lows and fiscal discipline improved, laying the groundwork for cautious optimism. However, weak industrial performance and external sector volatility signaled the need for sustained policy attention.

During the first seven months of FY2025 (July 2024 to January 2025), the agriculture sector sustained momentum, underpinned by a 16% increase in agricultural credit disbursement from the same period last year. On the other hand, the Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector contracted by 1.8% year-on-year, despite 2.1% month-on-month recovery in January 2025. Sector-specific trends were mixed, with growth in automobiles, tobacco, and textiles, offset by decline in food, chemicals, and steel.

A notable disinflationary trend characterized Q1 2025, with average year on year CPI inflation easing to around 1.5%, the lowest in nearly six decades. The month-on-month inflation was contained at 0.7% in March 2025, despite seasonal inflationary pressures historically witnessed during Ramdan. Overall, inflationary pressures remained subdued, providing relief to consumers and space for policy flexibility.

SBP in its Monetary Policy Committee meeting on March 10, 2025, opted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 12%, halting its monetary easing cycle after six consecutive rate cuts from June.


# Bank’s Performance

A detailed review of the Bank’s performance is given in the following paragraphs:

| March 31, 2025 | First Quarter |
| -------------- | ------------- |

2024 to January 2025. The decision reflected a shift toward caution by SBP, driven by concerns about persistent core inflation and emerging external sector vulnerabilities. Despite headline inflation falling to historic lows, the SBP opted for a prudent stance, acknowledging the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability.

The fiscal consolidation measures have yielded positive results, showing improvements in fiscal accounts during the 1H FY25, with the budget deficit narrowing to 1.2% of the GDP, down from 2.3% in the same period last year. The primary surplus showed significant improvement of PKR 3.6 trillion (2.9% of GDP) with SBP profit contributing 70% (PKR 2.5 Trillion) of the primary surplus in the 1H FY25. Provinces have also performed above expectations and contributed PKR 775 billion surplus thus bringing down the overall fiscal deficit. GDP grew 1.73% YoY in 2QFY25, led by agriculture (1.10%) and services (2.57%), while the industrial sector contracted slightly (-0.18%).

The KSE-100 Index experienced volatility, declining early in the year before rebounding in March to close at 117,807, up 4% for the quarter. It hit an all-time high of 119,000 but struggled with low trading volumes, particularly during Ramadan. Despite foreign and mutual fund outflows, local banks emerged as net buyers. Investor interest was notably strong in the energy sector, driven by expectations of IMF-backed reforms to resolve circular debt.

Pakistan’s current account posted a surplus during July-March in the ongoing fiscal year. During 9MFY25 current account stands at USD 1.859 billion. Pakistan recorded its highest-ever monthly current account surplus in March 2025 of USD 1.195 billion. The workers remittances for 9MFY25 stood at USD 28.029 billion. For the month of March alone, worker remittances posted highest ever inflow of USD 4.1 billion. Goods exports rose 7.72% YoY to USD 24.660 billion, while imports climbed 11.08% to USD 43.38 billion, widening the trade deficit to USD 18.728 billion. Balance on trade in goods and services stands at the deficit of USD 21.046 billion compared to a deficit of USD 18.34 billion during the same period last year.

The first quarter of 2025 presented a cautiously optimistic picture for Pakistan’s economy. Disinflationary trends provided much-needed relief to households and created space for potential monetary support, while fiscal consolidation efforts showed tangible progress. However, challenges persisted in the external sector and manufacturing performance, necessitating continued policy vigilance. The government’s focus on macroeconomic stability, along with sectoral support, will remain crucial to sustaining momentum through the remainder of the fiscal year. If inflation remains low and external buffers are preserved, conditions may become favorable for a broader economic recovery in the coming quarters. However, rising global trade tensions following new U.S. tariffs on key imports and retaliatory measures from China and other affected countries, pose additional risks to Pakistan’s external sector and overall investor sentiment. These geopolitical developments may disrupt trade flows and supply chains, warranting proactive monitoring and adaptive policy responses to safeguard economic resilience.

| Tax                                                                | (5,965)   | (5,965)   | -        |
| Profit after tax                                                   | 5,147     | 6,513     | (21.0)   |
| Earnings per share (Rupees)                                        | 3.39      | 4.29      | (21.0)   |
| Gain on equity securities directly realized in equity (net of tax) | 860       | 201       | 327.9    |

On a standalone basis, Profit Before Tax (PBT) is at PKR 11.1 billion, reflecting resilient performance despite a challenging macro-economic environment. Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at PKR 5.1 billion, impacted by an increase in the tax rate from 49% to 53%. Earnings Per Share decreased from PKR 4.29 to PKR 3.39.

Total revenue stood at PKR 22.1 billion in Q1’25, while this represents a decline of 5.9% over Q1’24, it reflects the Bank’s ability to maintain strong topline momentum despite a sharp reduction in policy rates and the implementation of the Minimum Deposit Rate (MDR) on savings deposits effective January 1, 2025. Net spreads earned were PKR 17.2 billion, with the impact of margin compression partially offset by strong growth in current deposits, which increased by PKR 102 billion (27.5%) YoY.

Non-fund income remained a key source of revenue, growing by 4.4% over the corresponding quarter last year and is at PKR 4.9 billion in Q1’25. Fee income has a robust growth of 20.3%, reaching PKR 3.1 billion, while foreign exchange income remained resilient, growing by 7.3%, to PKR 1.7 billion. Additionally, the Bank realized gain of PKR 0.9 billion on equity securities booked in equity during Q1’25, compared to PKR 0.2 billion in Q1’24.

The Bank’s total expenses increased by 21% over Q1’24, driven by inflation and the full year impact of an expanded branch network. There is however a net reversal of PKR 2.3 billion in provisions compared to a charge of PKR 0.03 billion in Q1’24. Asset quality continued to improve with the NPL ratio declining to 3.4% as compared to 3.6% as at Dec’24. The total coverage stands at 100.3%.

6   First Quarter  March 31, 2025


# FBL Financial Overview

FBL’s total assets continued to grow, reaching PKR 1.6 trillion, driven by strong deposit mobilization. The upward trend in Current Accounts seen over the past few years continued, taking them to PKR 472 billion i.e., 15.6% growth over December 2024. Total deposits also increased by 6.6% over December 2024 and are at PKR 1.1 trillion. Current Account (CA) mix improved to 42.4% from 39.1% in December 2024 and CASA mix improved to 88.3% from 85.5% in December 2024.

FBL’s net financing increased by 1.5% to PKR 644 billion and ADR moderated to 57.8% as at Mar’25 from 60.7% at Dec’24. Investments increased by 2.2% and reached PKR 693 billion.

# Outlook

Looking forward, we are cognizant of the intense competition and the expected compression in spreads due to decline in the policy rate and introduction of Minimum Deposit Rate (MDR) on saving accounts of Islamic banks. Despite these pressures, through FBL’s prudent financial management, Insha’Allah, the Bank will be able to navigate these challenges and sustain growth.

As part of our strategic vision, the Bank is committed to expanding its branch network to drive deposit growth and improve customer reach. Simultaneously, we are focused on improving customer experience through streamlined processes and by investing in cutting-edge digital solutions that will elevate our digital offerings and enrich overall customer experience.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements (un-audited)
# For the quarter ended March 31, 2025

# 1 STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

# 1.1

Faysal Bank Limited (the Bank) was incorporated in Pakistan on October 3, 1994 as a public limited company under the provisions of the repealed Companies Ordinance, 1984 (now the Companies Act, 2017). Its shares are listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited. The Bank is engaged in Shariah compliant modern Corporate, Commercial and Consumer banking activities.

# 1.2

The Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and VIS Credit Rating Company Limited have determined the Bank's long-term rating as 'AA' (December 31, 2024: 'AA') and the short term rating as 'A1+' (December 31, 2024: 'A1+') on June 24, 2024 and June 28, 2024 respectively.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

The Bank provides financing mainly through Murabaha, Musawammah, Istisna and other Islamic modes as briefly explained in note 6.8 to the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognised in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Shariah Board of the Bank.

# 2.2

The Bank has controlling interest in Faysal Asset Management Limited (FAML) and Faysal Islami Currency Exchange Company (Private) Limited and is required to prepare consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017. These condensed interim financial statements represent the unconsolidated results of the Bank and a separate set of condensed interim consolidated financial statements are also being presented by the Bank.

# 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 3.1

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards applicable in Pakistan comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of, and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the application instructions through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements. Islamic banking institutions have been allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where

# 3.1

applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. The impact of profit of financing in advance stage is Rs. 1,551 million excluding any Effective yield rate (EIR) effect as the Bank has received deferment of recording income and expense at EIR via letter from SBP till December 31, 2025. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3.2

As per the directive of the SBP through its letter BPRD (R&P-02)/625-99/2011/3744 dated March 28, 2011, gain arising on bargain purchase of Pakistan operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (ex-RBS Pakistan) was credited directly into equity as Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The SBP allowed the Bank to adjust the amortisation of intangible assets against the portion of reserve which arose on account of such assets identified as a result of such acquisition. Accordingly, during the period ended March 31, 2025, the Bank has adjusted amortisation of intangible assets net of tax amounting to Rs. 6.235 million (period ended March 31, 2024: Rs. 10.472 million) from the NCR.

# 3.3

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements, and are limited based on the format prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular Letter No. 2 of 2023 dated February 9, 2023 and IAS 34 and should be read in conjunction with the annual unconsolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2024.

# 3.4.1

There are certain new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on January 1, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations are therefore not detailed in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.1 Fair valuation of unquoted equity securities

# 6 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

# 6.1

Items included in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates. These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.

# 6.2

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand of rupees unless otherwise stated.

# 7 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024 except for fair valuation of unlisted equity securities.

|        | The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2024: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) \[CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter. |                                 |
| 24.4   | There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 32,633 million (December 31, 2024: Rs 32,274 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2024: Rs 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.                              |                                 |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

| Item                               | Valuation approach and input used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ijara Sukuk                        | Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.                                         |
| Unlisted ordinary shares           | The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.                                                                                                                                 |
| Sukuk Certificates                 | Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties.                                                                                     |
| Derivative instruments             | Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. |
| Mutual funds                       | Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).                                                                                                                                                          |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

# 4.1

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards applicable in Pakistan comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of, and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted requirements of IFRS 9 along with the application instructions through BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023, dated April 13, 2023, but deferred certain requirements. Islamic banking institutions have been allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue existing accounting practices for other Islamic products until further instructions. The impact of profit of financing in advance stage is Rs. 1,551 million excluding any Effective yield rate (EIR) effect as the Holding Company has received deferment of recording income and expense at EIR via letter from SBP till December 31, 2025. Consequently, these deferred requirements of IFRS 9 have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (un-audited) For the quarter ended March 31, 2025

# 5.1 Fair valuation of unquoted equity securities

The fair value of unquoted equity instruments is determined by applying the adjusted net assets method, as no quoted market prices or reliable valuation inputs are available. All fair value adjustments are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated within equity, in accordance with IFRS 9.

# 6 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which have been carried at revalued amounts, certain investments and derivative contracts which have been marked to market and are carried at fair value, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liabilities (adjusted for any lease payments and costs) and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

# 7 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

# 7.1

Items included in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.

# 7.2

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand of rupees unless otherwise stated.

# 8 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024 except for fair valuation of unlisted equity securities.

# 25.3 Other contingent liabilities

# 25.3.1 Holding Company:

Suit filed by a customer for recovery of alleged losses suffered which is pending in the Honorable High Court of Sindh. The Bank’s legal advisors are confident that the Bank has a strong case.

|                                                                                 | 2,510,000 | 2,510,000 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Indemnity issued favouring the Honorable High Court in one of the cases         | 457,543   | 457,543   |
| Tax liability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan | (i)       | 1,154,701 |
|                                                                                 |           | 4,122,244 |

(i) Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised upto the tax year 2024 (accounting year ended December 31, 2023). The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2024: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.

(ii) There are certain claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 32,633 million (December 31, 2024: Rs 32,274 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Group from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Group was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Group for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Group's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2024: Rs 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Group for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Group's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# Fair value of financial assets

37.1 The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2025

# Fair Value Measurements

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

| Item                               | Valuation approach and input used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ijara Sukuk                        | Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.                                         |
| Unlisted ordinary shares           | The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of adjusted net asset method as per their latest available financial statements.                                                                                                                                 |
| Sukuk Certificates                 | Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Derivative instruments             | Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. |
| Mutual funds                       | Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).                                                                                                                                                          |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
