DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the financial statements of United Bank Limited (UBL) for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

# Performance Overview

On a standalone basis, UBL recorded Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 75.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025, with a strong growth of 147% year on year. Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at Rs. 35.6 billion for Q1’25 as compared to Rs. 15.6 billion for Q1’24 with Earnings per share (EPS) of Rs. 28.92 compared to Rs. 12.73 for last year. On a consolidated basis, UBL reported PAT of Rs. 36.1 billion (Q1’24: Rs. 16.1 billion) with consolidated EPS of Rs. 29.34 (Q1’24: Rs. 13.05).

The Board of Directors declared an interim cash dividend of Rs. 11 per share in their meeting held in Islamabad on April 16, 2025 along with the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

The Bank’s gross revenues were Rs. 99.8 billion in Q1’25, a year on year growth of 112%. Net mark-up income was recorded at Rs. 84.2 billion which was primarily driven by expansion in UBL’s current account deposits. The Bank earned non-markup income of Rs. 15.6 billion in Q1’25 with a strong build up in core revenues. Fees and commission income of Rs. 6.5 billion was earned in Q1’25, a year on year growth of 23%. This was led by strong growth in card related fees, supported by solid trade income, corporate service fees and UBL’s continued leadership position in the domestic home remittances space.

The Bank’s operating expenses recorded a 40% increase over Q1’24 and stood at Rs. 24.6 billion in Q1’25. This was driven by staff costs increasing by 30% year on year to Rs. 9.7 billion, property related expenses rising 42% year on year to Rs. 3.4 billion and IT expenses increasing 27% year on year to Rs 2.5 billion. The Bank continues to invest in its branch network, digital products and IT infrastructure to augment growth.

UBL recorded a net provision reversal of Rs. 1.6 billion for Q1’25 against a net provision reversal of Rs. 1.7 billion in Q1’24 mainly resulting from recoveries in the international portfolio.

The bank seeks to maintain an efficient capital base that provides a foundation for future growth as well as maintaining adequate buffers over regulatory requirements. The consolidated CAR stood at 21.4% as of Mar’25 (Dec’24: 20.6%), with a buffer of 8.9% over the minimum regulatory requirement of 12.5%. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) ratio stood at 15.8% as of Mar’25 (Dec’24: 14.8%). The Total Tier 1 Capital ratio was 16.3% as of Mar’25 (Dec’24: 15.5%).

# Amalgamation of Silk Bank Limited (SBL) with and into UBL

During the first Quarter, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has approved the scheme of amalgamation of Silk Bank Limited (SBL) with and into UBL and accordingly the process of amalgamation has been completed. Details are given in note 1.1 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# Proposed Share Subdivision and Capital Restructuring

In order to enhance the investors’ accessibility and improve the market liquidity, the Board of Directors have recommended to the shareholders the subdivision of one (01) ordinary share of United Bank Limited (UBL), having face value of PKR 10/- each into two (02) ordinary shares of face value of PKR 5/- each, with no change in rights, privileges and entitlements of the shareholders of the Bank subject to completion of all requisite regulatory approvals.

The Board has decided to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM) on May 15, 2025, for the consideration and approval of the subdivision of shares by the shareholders of UBL.


Quarterly Report March 31, 2025



Credit Rating

# Credit Rating

VIS Credit Rating Company Limited (VIS) re-affirmed the entity ratings of UBL at ‘‘AAA / A-1+” (Triple A / A-One Plus) in June 2024. Moreover, UBL’s Additional Tier-1 (ADT-1) TFC has also been re-affirmed at ‘AA+’ (Double A plus). Outlook on the assigned ratings are ‘Stable’.

# Future Outlook

UBL is driving forward with agility and resilience in 2025, strengthening its core franchise in both conventional and Islamic banking. The Bank is committed to expanding its customer base, deepening relationships, and growing its market share in low-cost deposits to maximize returns. With a focus on digital excellence, UBL is enhancing its platforms for a seamless and secure banking experience. People remain a priority, with investments in talent development and leadership.

A key milestone this year is the merger with Silk Bank, which will expand UBL’s presence in urban centers, strengthen its branch network, and grow its customer base across key regions. With a strong emphasis on customer service and innovation, UBL is well-positioned for sustained growth, stability, and resilience in 2025 and beyond.

# Acknowledgements

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to express our appreciation to UBL’s customers and shareholders for their continued trust in the UBL brand and to the UBL staff for their commitment and dedication. We would also like to extend our gratitude to the Government of Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and other regulatory bodies for their continuous guidance and support.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting standards that are not yet effective

There are various amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective. These are not likely to have a material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024, except as disclosed in Notes 3.1.

# 3.1 Fair valuation of unlisted equity securities

With effect from January 01, 2025, unlisted equity investments are valued at their fair value, which represents the price at which the investment could be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Previously, these were measured at the lower of cost and break up value derived on the basis of their latest available audited financial statements.

The measurement of the fair value of unlisted equity investments involves the use of valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by the prices from observable market data. These may involve the analysis of an investee's financial position and results, risk profile and other judgemental factors. The chosen valuation techniques depend on the availability of market data and the profile of the investee and incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction and are aimed at maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and limiting the use of unobservable data.

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2025

Favourable and unfavourable changes in the value of investments are determined on the basis of changes in the value as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters, quantification of which is judgmental.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Bank has also availed FSV benefit of certain mortgaged properties held as collateral against non-performing advances of overseas branches in accordance with the applicable regulations in the respective countries where the branches operate. Had the benefit not been taken by the Bank, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 641.92 million (December 31, 2024: Rs. 1,254.08 million) for the overseas branches. The FSV benefit availed is not available for the distribution of cash or stock dividend to shareholders.

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss, are fully provided and are in default for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with the SBP's Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2025

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.2

This includes, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion which were levied during 2016, by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and filed a Constitutional Petition in 2018 in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank, which stay order was in the field till February 2025, when the High Court of Sindh dismissed the Petition filed by the Bank and other Banks as well. The Bank has decided to challenge the said decision of the High Court before the Supreme Court of Pakistan by filing an Appeal, through the appropriate legal counsel. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 35.1.

The Bank issued 27,944,213 shares in pursuant to Silk Bank Limited amalgamation with and into United Bank Limited. There were no convertible dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.

# 36. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is carried at fair value. The valuation is carried out using appropriate methodologies.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the period ended March 31, 2025 stood at Rs.12,521.239 million (December 31, 2024: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2025. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 21.24% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 15.56% and 16.14% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2018 dated April 13, 2018, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/751777/2024 dated August 29, 2024. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 1.0%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

# 41. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

# 42. NON-ADJUSTING EVENT AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

The Board of Directors in its meeting held on April 16, 2025 has declared an interim cash dividend in respect of quarter ended March 31, 2025 of Rs. 11.0 per share (March 31, 2024: Rs. 11.0 per share). These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2025 do not include the effect of these appropriations which will be accounted for subsequent to the period end.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

There are various amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective. These are not likely to have a material effect on the Group’s consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements, are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, except as disclosed in notes 3.1.

# 3.1 Fair valuation of unlisted equity securities

With effect from January 01, 2025, unlisted equity investments are valued at their fair value, which represents the price at which the investment could be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Previously, these were measured at the lower of cost and break up value derived on the basis of their latest available audited financial statements.

The measurement of the fair value of unlisted equity investments involves the use of valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by the prices from observable market data. These may involve the analysis of an investee's financial position and results, risk profile and other judgemental factors. The chosen valuation techniques depend on the availability of market data and the profile of the investee and incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction and are aimed at maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and limiting the use of unobservable data.

Favourable and unfavourable changes in the value of investments are determined on the basis of changes in the value as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters, quantification of which is judgmental.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 10.3.2

The Bank has also availed FSV benefit of certain mortgaged properties held as collateral against non-performing advances of overseas branches in accordance with the applicable regulations in the respective countries where the branches operate. Had the benefit not been taken by the Bank, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs 641.92 million (December 31, 2024: Rs. 1,254.08 million) for the overseas branches. The FSV benefit availed is not available for the distribution of cash or stock dividend to shareholders.

# 10.4

These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss, are fully provided and are in default for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with the SBP's Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

The call option once announced will be irrevocable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Lock-in clause            | As per the lock-in requirement for Tier II issues, neither profit nor principal will be payable (even at maturity) in respect of the TFC, if such payment will result in a shortfall in the Bank’s Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) or Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) or results in an increase in any existing shortfall in MCR or CAR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Loss absorbency clause    | The instrument will be subject to loss absorbency and / or any other requirements under SBP’s Basel III Capital Rules. Upon the occurrence of a point of non-viability event as defined by SBP’s Basel III Capital Rule, the SBP may at its option, fully and permanently convert the TFCs into common shares of the Bank and / or have them immediately written off (either partially or in full). Number of shares to be issued to TFC holders at the time of conversion will be equal to the ‘Outstanding Face Value of the TFCs’ divided by fair value per share of the Bank’s common equity on the date of trigger of the non-viability event as declared by the SBP, subject to a cap of 3,810,431 shares. |

Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty.

# 36. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is carried at fair value. The valuation is carried out using appropriate methodologies.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the three months ended March 31, 2025 stood at Rs.12,521.239 million (December 31, 2024: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Further, under Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2025. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 21.40% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 15.75% and 16.32% respectively.

Furthermore, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2018 dated April 13, 2018, UBL has been designated as a D-SIB under letter BSD-3/Bank/UBL/751777/2024 dated August 29, 2024. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 1.0%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level. The prescribed HLA under D-SIB shall remain effective till the next D-SIB designation announcement is made by State Bank of Pakistan.

# 41. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.
