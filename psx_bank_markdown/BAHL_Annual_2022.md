The shareholders of the Bank have approved a ‘Policy & Procedure for Fixing Remuneration of Directors’, which states that:

- The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors for attending Board and Committee meetings shall be decided by the Board within the maximum limit as specified by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time.
- The Chairman of the Board is also entitled to have 20% additional remuneration fee of the remuneration set for him for attending Board and its Committee meeting considering the Chairman’s vast knowledge, experience, insight, sense of judgement and market contacts. The Chairman of the Board shall also monitor the performance of the Bank’s management and implementation of the Business Plan of the Bank on behalf of the Board.

# Credit Rating

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) are AAA (Triple A) for TFC-2018, TFC-2021 and TFC-2022, and AA+ (Double A plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual) and TFC-2022 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

# Future Outlook

In the fiscal year 2022, GDP of Pakistan recorded a growth of 6%. It was broad-based growth across all sectors - agriculture, industry, and services. Growth in large-scale manufacturing was particularly impressive at over 10%.

Soon after, current account and budget deficits rose to high levels and the country’s foreign exchange reserves declined significantly, mainly because of increase in current account deficit and external debt repayments.

The current year, 2023, will be a very challenging for the country due to decline in foreign exchange reserves, depreciation of Pak Rupee, rise in inflation rate and delay in finalization of IMF program. Restrictions on import of raw materials may adversely affect the industrial production and consequently the GDP growth rate is likely to decline significantly. The Government and the State Bank are taking fiscal and monetary measures, together with ensuring compliance of the IMF program, with the aim of stabilizing the economy.

Given the Bank’s consistent conservative approach, our emphasis during the year will be on consolidation combined with prudent growth and vigilant monitoring, which will InshaAllah enable us to steer through these difficult times.


# Auditors

The present auditors EY Ford Rhodes, Chartered Accountants, retire and offer themselves for reappointment. As suggested by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors has recommended their reappointment as auditors of the Bank for the year ending December 31, 2023, at a fee to be mutually agreed.

# Risk Management Framework

The Bank always had a risk management framework commensurate with the size of the Bank and the nature of its business. This framework has developed over the years and continues to be refined and improved. A key guiding principle of the Bank is to treat the depositors’ money as a trust which must be protected. Therefore, the Bank aims to take business risks in a prudent manner, guided by a conservative outlook.

# Salient features of the Bank’s risk management framework are summarized below:

- Credit risk is managed through the credit policies approved by the Board; a well-defined credit approval mechanism; use of internal risk ratings; prescribed documentation requirements; post-disbursement administration, review, and monitoring of credit facilities; and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. The Bank has also established a mechanism for independent, post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s credit risk.
- Market risk is managed through the market risk policy and treasury & investment policy approved by the Board; approval of counterparty limits and dealer limits; and regular review and monitoring of the investment portfolio by the Bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). In addition, the liquidity risk policy provides guidance in managing the liquidity position of the Bank, which is monitored on daily basis by the Treasury and the Middle Office. Decisions regarding the investment portfolio are taken mainly by ALCO. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s market and liquidity risks, capital adequacy, and integrated risk management (also known as enterprise risk management).
- Operational risk is managed through the audit policy, the operational risk policy, the compliance policy & programme, IT and IT security policies, human resource policy, consumer protection framework, and outsourcing policy approved by the Board, along with the fraud prevention policy; consumer grievance handling policy; operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; a system of internal controls and dual authorization for important transactions and safe-keeping; a Business Continuity Plan, including a Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s operational risk.

In addition, Risk Management Policy, Risk Tolerance Statement, and Country Risk Management Policy provide further guidance on managing the potential risk exposures of the Bank.

In order to comply with SBP’s guidelines on risk management, the Bank has established a separate Risk Management Division, including a Middle Office, that independently monitors and analyses the risks inherent in Treasury operations. The steps taken by the Division include: sensitivity testing of Government Securities portfolio; computation of portfolio duration and modified duration; analysis of maturity mismatch and rate sensitive assets and liabilities, analysis of forward foreign exchange gap positions; more detailed reporting of TFCs and equities portfolios; development of improved procedures for dealing in equities and settlements; monitoring of off-market foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange earnings; collecting operational loss data and developing Key Risk Indicators; identifying Top Ten Risks of the Bank; conducting risk evaluation of products and processes; and establishment of a mechanism for independent, post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Assessment of enterprise-wide integrated risk profile of the Bank is carried out, using the Basel Framework, Key Risk Indicators, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, Stress Testing, and Recovery Plan.

The Bank had engaged KPMG Taseer Hadi & Co. to assist in developing the draft of remuneration policy, keeping in view the culture and values of the Bank, and other related matters.

Additionally, performance evaluation of the Board is to be conducted by an external independent evaluator at least every three years. The Bank has appointed Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) for external independent evaluation of the full Board, Individual Directors, Board Committees, the Chairman, and the Chief Executive.

There is no conflict of interest between the experts hired by the Bank and any Board member or Key Executive.

# Disclosure relating to the Remuneration Policy:

Key objectives of Remuneration Policy are to:

- Attract, retain, and develop competent employees.
- Identify senior Risk Takers and Controllers.
- Offer remuneration that is fair and competitive.
- Encourage behaviour and practices, consistent with the Bank’s Strategy, Vision, Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles.
- Discourage material risk taking.
- Avoid any conflict of interest between the employee and the Bank.
- Establish a management structure to administer and oversee implementation of this Policy.

Bank AL Habib has low tolerance for risk and is averse to taking material risks, i.e., risks that can have a material adverse impact on its business and financial position. Therefore, the Bank does not have any defined Bonus Policy (in any form like cash, stocks, stock options, or other types of incentive pay) to incentivise achievement of performance targets, which may prompt material risk taking. Accordingly, a fundamental principle of the Bank is that employee remuneration is paid in the form of Fixed Remuneration. This has enabled the Bank to maintain sustainable growth and profitability over the years, with a low risk profile and low staff turnover.

There are management committees/senior employees who are authorized to approve risk exposures involving large amounts and deal with other institutionally important matters. They are designated as Senior Risk Takers, who are responsible not only for taking risks, but also for mitigating, monitoring, and controlling the risks taken by the Bank. The Bank encourages and emphasizes risk control, rather than risk taking, which means that control responsibilities take precedence for employees at all levels. Therefore, in case of Senior Risk Takers also, their control responsibilities are paramount and take precedence over their other responsibilities.

Risk Controllers are employees whose professional activities include review, identification, mitigation, and control of risks to which the Bank may be exposed, or providing assistance or assurance related to such activities. Risk control is the responsibility of all functional units of the Bank, including various functions at Principal Office who provide input to line functions on risk management and control, assist them in designing and implementing adequate controls, and independently monitor that the prescribed controls and limits are being complied with.


# Employee Appraisal Principles

It is a key principle of employee appraisal that employees must not get penalized or suffer as a consequence of carrying out control activities for which they are institutionally responsible and duly authorized. Any deviation from this principle will be taken very seriously.

# Key Criteria for Evaluation of Performance

- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
- Commitment to the Bank’s Vision, Mission, and Values.
- Compliance with the Bank’s risk and control policies, procedures, and limits.
- Behaviour with customers and colleagues.
- Knowledge and quality of work.
- New ideas and suggestions.
- Growth of business and profitability vs. business objectives (as applicable).
- Persistence and productivity.
- Job performance.
- Teamwork and People Development.

Fixed Remuneration is determined on the basis of role and responsibility of the individual, professional expertise and experience, job performance, and potential for growth. In addition, all employees of the Bank are required to carry out their duties with due care and in an ethical manner. They must act in accordance with the Bank’s Strategy, Vision, Mission, Values, Guiding Principles, Code of Conduct, Policies and Procedures, within the authorities and limits delegated to them. This means that protection of the Bank’s reputation, trustworthiness, and safety is of paramount importance and takes precedence over profit maximization.

Risk management policies, together with the Risk Tolerance Statement, authorities, and limits approved by the Board, provide the necessary guidance on risk taking activities of the Bank. Actions taken and decisions made by the employees are institutionally owned and protected by the Bank, as long as these are within the ambit of the prescribed policies and procedures and there is no evidence of self-dealing.

Governance of remuneration is accomplished through a formal structure which includes: Board of Directors; Human Resource & Remuneration Committee; Chief Executive; Human Resource Division; and Finance, Audit, Compliance, and Risk Management Divisions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT

# To the members of Bank AL Habib Limited

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Bank AL Habib Limited (the Bank) for the year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee. We have not carried out procedures to assess and determine the Bank’s process for identification of related parties and that whether the related party transactions were undertaken at arm’s length price or not.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022.

STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS


The Management of the Bank is responsible for establishing the Internal Control System with the main objectives of ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations; reliability of financial reporting; safeguarding of assets; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Internal Control System has evolved over the years, as it is an ongoing process and is included in the Bank’s policies, procedures, financial limits, etc., as detailed in various manuals, circulars and instructions issued by the Bank. This system continues to be reviewed, refined and improved from time to time and immediate corrective action is taken to minimize risks which are inherent in banking business and operations.

The Internal Control System is reviewed by the Internal Auditors as well as External Auditors and their findings and recommendations are reported to the management and to the Audit Committee of the Board, and corrective action is taken to address control deficiencies and for improving procedures and systems as they are identified. The Board, acting through the Audit Committee, provides supervision and overall guidance in improving the effectiveness of the Internal Control System.

While the Internal Control System is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective Internal Control System can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system’s objectives will be achieved.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) aims to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the applicable financial reporting standards. During the year, Internal Auditors tested the Bank’s ICFR and reported their findings to the management and the Audit Committee of the Board. While no material deficiencies were detected, indicating that ICFR is effectively implemented in the Bank, it may be reiterated that any control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that its objectives will be achieved.

In accordance with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) directives, the Bank has completed all the stages of ICFR. Upon satisfactory completion of ICFR roadmap, the Bank has been granted exemption by SBP from the requirement of submission of Long Form Report by the External Auditors.

The Bank has endeavored to follow the guidelines issued by SBP on internal controls. Updation and review of ICFR exercise for the year 2022 as per SBP Guidelines on Internal Controls has been successfully completed. In accordance with SBP directives, the annual assessment report for the year 2022 is being prepared. Evaluation and management of significant risks is an ongoing process and we will make further efforts to improve our Internal Control System during 2023.

| 1. Expected credit loss (ECL) / impairment provision against investment in foreign currency sovereign bonds | The Bank’s investment portfolio includes a gross carrying value (before provisions) of Rs. 34,520 million in respect of investments in sovereign bonds denominated in foreign currencies that are issued by Pakistan and other countries. These include sovereign bonds with defaulted status as well as other bonds with varying credit ratings. During the year, the Bank has made an aggregate impairment provisions including expected credit loss (“ECL”) provisions amounting to Rs. 9,356 million in respect of the above portfolio of investments. Due to the significance of the events impacting the sovereign bonds portfolio, particularly the defaults and deterioration of credit ratings, together with the judgements and estimates involved in determining the impairment / ECL provisions, we have considered this area as a Key Audit Matter. Please refer to Note 8.3.1 for disclosure in relation to the above referred portfolio and the related provisions.- We applied the following key audit procedures in respect of impairment / ECL provisions for foreign currency sovereign bonds portfolio:
- We obtained an understanding of the accounting policies and the impairment framework used by the Bank for determining impairment / ECL provisions against this portfolio.
- We assessed ECL methodologies implemented by the Bank in relation to this portfolio by reference to the requirements of IFRS 9. In this regard, we focused on the sources of information underlying the credit ratings and Probability of default assumptions, together with consistency in the application of ECL model.
- In respect of defaulted sovereign bonds, we considered the publicly available information about the countries’ economic conditions, market prices observed post default and available currently.
- We also discussed, with the auditors of overseas operations regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of impairment / ECL provisions, made by the Bank, in line with the applicable regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdictions.
- We also obtained reports from independent auditors of the relevant jurisdictions based on International Standards of Auditing.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 8.3.1 to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing investments and provisions made for the same in the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |



# Key audit matter

# 2. Provision against Non Performing loans and advances

The Bank’s advances portfolio represents 35.81% of its total assets as of 31 December 2022. A substantial portion of the advances portfolio includes loans and advances to businesses operating in diverse sectors of the economy.

As per the Bank’s accounting policy (refer note 4.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements), the Bank determines provisions against non-performing advances exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning for loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Bank’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision therefore, involve use of management judgment, on a case to case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Bank.

In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the unconsolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of provision against advances as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter.

The accounting policy and disclosures relating to provisioning against non-performing advances are included in note 4.4 and 9 respectively to the unconsolidated financial statements.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

We applied a range of audit procedures including the following:

- We reviewed the Bank’s process for identification and classification of non-performing advances. As part of such review we performed an analysis of the changes within the different categories of classified non-performing accounts from last year to the current reporting date. This analysis was used to gather audit evidence regarding downgrading of impaired advances and declassification of accounts from non-performing to regular and vice versa, as the case may be.
- We have performed procedures on test basis for the computations of provisions to assess that the same is in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations;
- In addition, we selected a representative sample of borrowers from the advances portfolios including individually significant credit facilities and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Bank and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower;
- In respect of the level of general provision maintained by the Bank, we discussed the approach and policy followed by the Bank with the management and the regulatory approvals in place for such policy.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9 to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing advances and provisions made for the same in the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement (together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Arslan Khalid.

SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' and IAS 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. Further, SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 directed the Banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' with effect from 01 January 2023. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

In case of overseas branches, IFRS 9 / respective foreign regulatory requirements are considered for recording, classification and valuation of investment.

# 2.8

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

# 2.8.1 IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'

Regulatory Framework applicable to the banking sector

As per SBP BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022, the effective date for the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is accounting period beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As part of the same circular, SBP has issued detailed instructions on the application of the Standard, including transitional provisions, impact on the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) calculation and reporting requirements.

The IFRS 9 application instructions and guidelines that have been issued as part of the circular include the following key components:

- a) Basis for classification and measurement of debt and equity securities;
- b) Framework for determination of “Expected Credit Losses (ECL)” under the requirements of IFRS 9, including required risk management policies;
- c) Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities have been exempted from the application of the above ECL Framework;
- d) In respect of non-performing exposures (Stage 3 exposures) provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements;
- e) In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital and fully described in Annexure B to the aforementioned circular.

The State Bank of Pakistan vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023

has issued revised formats for interim and annual financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from January 01, 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures on adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022. The estimated ECL adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at January 1, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 1,717 million (without considering general provisions already held).

As at 31 December 2022, the management is carrying a general provision of Rs. 5,750 million (before tax) against loans / advances portfolio on prudent basis. After IFRS 9 implementation, the management of the Bank may decide on the amount of management ECL overlay out of the general provision already held.

# Critical accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis of making judgment about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the unconsolidated financial statements are in respect of the following:

Amounts received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is amortised as expense over the term of the repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds received and subsequently reported as payable under the contractual terms.

Purchase under resale obligation

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resale at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position. Amounts paid under these arrangements are included in repurchase agreement lendings. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as income over the term of the reverse repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds disbursed and subsequently reported as receivable under the contractual terms.

Bai Muajjal

In Bai Muajjal, the Bank sells sukuk on credit to other financial institutions. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period.

# 4.3 Investments

Subsidiaries are entities over which the Bank has control. Investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment, if any.




# Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Investment in associates is stated at cost less provision for impairment, if any. Certain mutual funds are managed by the subsidiary company of the Bank and hence, the Bank has significant influence over such funds and therefore, investments in these mutual funds are considered as investment in associates.

# Held-for-trading

These are investments acquired principally for the purpose of generating profits from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term trading exists.

# Held-to-maturity

These are investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities which the Bank has the intention and ability to hold till maturity.

In Bai Muajjal, the Bank sells sukuk on credit to Government of Pakistan. The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period.

# Available-for-sale

These are investments which do not fall under held for trading and held to maturity categories. All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Investments (other than held for trading) are initially measured at fair value plus transaction cost associated with the investment. Investments classified as held for trading are initially measured at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the profit and loss account.

After initial recognition, quoted securities (other than those classified as held to maturity) are carried at market value. Unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment in value, if any. Held to maturity securities are carried at amortised cost.

Surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as 'available-for-sale', is included in the statement of comprehensive income and is shown in the statement of financial position as part of equity. The surplus / (deficit) arising on these securities is taken to the profit and loss account when actually realised upon disposal or in case of impairment of securities. The unrealised surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as held for trading is taken to the profit and loss account.

Premium or discount on debt securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity is amortised using effective interest method and taken to the profit and loss account.

Details of valuation techniques used in determination of fair value is included in note 39 of unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.4 Advances

# Loans and advances

These are stated net of provisions for non-performing advances.

# Receivables against lease finance where Bank is a lessor (other than Ijarah)

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value.

# Islamic Financing and Related Assets

# Ijarah finance

Assets leased out under ijarah arrangements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Such assets are depreciated over the terms of ijarah contracts.




# Murabaha

Funds disbursed under murabaha arrangements for purchase of goods are recorded as advance for murabaha. On culmination of murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, murabaha receivables are recorded at the sale price net of deferred income. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the reporting date are recorded as inventories.

# Inventory

The Bank values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Bank / customers as an agent of the Bank for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

# Istisna

In Istisna financing, the Bank places an order to purchase some specific goods / commodities from its customers to be delivered to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount hence financed is paid back to the Bank.

# Diminishing Musharaka

In Diminishing Musharaka financing, the Bank enters into Musharaka based on Shirkat-ul-milk for financing an agreed share of fixed asset (e.g. house, land, plant or machinery) with its customers and enters into periodic rental payment agreement for the utilisation of the Bank’s Musharaka share by the customer. The customer purchases the Bank's share gradually as per his undertaking.

# Running Musharaka

In Running Musharaka financing, the Bank enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat-ul-Aqd or Business Partnership in customers operating business. Under this mechanism the customer can withdraw and return funds to the Bank subject to his Running Musharakah Financing limit during the Musharakah period. At the end of each quarter / half year the customer pays the provisional profit as per the desired profit rate which is subject to final settlement based on the relevant quarterly / half-yearly / annual accounts of the customer.

# Musawama

In Musawama financing, the Bank purchases specific goods / commodities on cash basis from its customer for onward sale. Upon realisation of sale proceeds, the finance is adjusted.

# Provision for non-performing advances

Provision for non-performing advances is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations for domestic branches, whereas requirements of respective central banks is followed in respect of overseas branches and is charged to the profit and loss account. The Bank also maintains general provision in addition to the requirements of the Prudential Regulations on the basis of the management's risk assessment.

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess amount of non-performing loans and determine provision required there against. While assessing this requirement various factors including the past dues, delinquency in the account, financial position and future business / financial plan of the borrower, value of collateral held and requirements of Prudential Regulations are considered. The Bank is allowed to consider the effect of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collaterals in determining the amount of provision, however, no benefit of FSV of collateral is taken in determining provisioning amount.

The amount of general provision against domestic consumer and SME advances is determined in accordance with the relevant / Prudential Regulations and SBP directives.

For overseas operations, the Bank records an allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (all referred to as ‘financial instruments’). The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the Lifetime Expected Credit Losses or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ Expected Credit Losses (12mECL). The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

Advances are written-off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery.



# 4.5 Operating fixed assets and depreciation

# Capital work in progress

Capital work in progress is stated at cost less impairment, if any.

# Property and equipment - owned

Land is measured at cost at the time of initial recognition and is subsequently carried at revalued amount less impairment, if any. Buildings are initially measured at cost and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. All other operating fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is charged to profit and loss account on straight line basis so as to charge the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2. The depreciation charge is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. Depreciation is charged on prorata basis, i.e., full month charge in the month of purchase and no charge in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from the fair value. The valuations involve estimates / assumptions and various market factors and conditions. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and buildings, except to the extent that it reversal of a deficit already charged to profit and loss account on the same asset. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in profit and loss account, except for a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets are included in income currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# Leases

The Bank assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Bank as a lessee

The Bank applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Right-of-use assets

The Bank recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The right-of-use assets are presented within note 10 fixed assets and are subject to impairment in line with the Bank’s policy as described in note 4.13 impairment of non-financial assets.


# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental lending rate to measure lease liabilities.

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Amortisation is based on straight line method by taking into consideration the estimated useful life of assets at the rates specified in note 11. Intangible assets are amortised on prorata basis i.e. full month amortisation in the month of purchase and no amortisation in the month of disposal.

# 4.6 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially measured at settlement amount and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued as per SBP's requirement by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title of assets is charged to profit and loss account and not capitalised.

# 4.7 Borrowings / deposits

Borrowings / deposits are recorded at the amount of proceeds received. The cost of borrowings / deposits is recognised on an accrual basis as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Deposits mobilized under Islamic Banking operations are generated under two modes i.e. “Qard” and “Modaraba”. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as ‘Current accounts’ and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as ‘Saving deposits / Fixed deposits / Current remunerative deposits’.

# 4.8 Subordinated debt

Subordinated debt is initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received and subsequently reported at outstanding amounts as a financial liability. Mark - up accrued on subordinated debt is recognised separately as part of other liabilities and is charged to the profit and loss account over the period on an accrual basis.

# 4.9 Employees' benefits

# Defined benefit plan

The Bank operates an approved gratuity fund for all its confirmed employees, which is administered by the Trustees. The Bank's costs and contributions are determined based on actuarial valuation carried out at each year end using Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Method. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in 'other comprehensive income' as they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods. The liabilities for employees' benefits plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets and future salary increases as disclosed in note 36. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.




# Defined contribution plan

The Bank operates an approved provident fund scheme for all its regular permanent employees, administered by the Trustees. Equal monthly contributions are made both by the Bank and its employees to the fund at the rate of 10% of the basic salary in accordance with the terms of the scheme.

# Compensated absences

The Bank accounts for all accumulating compensated absences when employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences. The liability is determined based on actuarial valuation carried out using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

Exchange gains or losses are included in income currently.

# Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Pak Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.

Mark-up / return / interest on rescheduled / restructured loans and advances and investments is recognised as permitted by the regulations of SBP.

(b) Financing method is used in accounting for income from lease financing. Under this method, the unrealised lease income is deferred and taken to income over the term of the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in lease. Gain / loss on termination of lease contracts, front end fee and other lease income are recognised as income on receipt basis.

(c) The rentals from ijarah are recognised as income over the term of the contract net of depreciation expense relating to the ijarah assets.

Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the related services. Unearned fee and commission are included under Other Liabilities.

# 4.12 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to the items recognised directly in equity or surplus on revaluation of assets, in which case it is recognised in equity or surplus on revaluation of assets.

# Current

Provision for current tax is based on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and any adjustments to the tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities.

# Deferred

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences at the statement of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investment in foreign operations, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit or taxable temporary differences will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management looks at the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. There are certain matters where the Bank’s view differs with the view taken by the income tax department and such amounts are shown as contingent liability.



# 4.13 Impairment

# Investments

Provision for diminution in the investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity (except for debt securities) is recognised after considering impairment, if any, in their value and is taken to profit and loss account.

This determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment.

Provision for impairment against debt securities (other than government securities) is made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations of SBP. In case of unquoted equity securities, the breakup value of the security is considered to determine impairment amount.

# Associates and subsidiaries

The carrying values of investments in associates and subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.

# Non-financial assets

The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amounts, the assets are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is taken to profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets which is adjusted against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the relevant surplus.

# 4.16 Off setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are only off-set and the net amount is reported in the financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised amount and the Bank intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expense items of such assets and liabilities are also off-set and the net amount is reported in the financial statements. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted by the approved accounting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# 4.17 Financial assets and liabilities

10.3 In accordance with the Bank's accounting policy, the Bank's leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land were revalued at 01 June 2020. The revaluation was carried out by an independent valuer, M/s. Iqbal A. Nanjee & Co. on the basis of present physical condition and location of leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land. Fair values were ascertained by the independent valuer under market approach through various enquiries conducted by them at site from real estate agents and brokers. The revaluation resulted in surplus of Rs. 3,618.097 million over the book value of the respective properties and also net deficit of Rs. 122.190 million on certain properties. Had the leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land not been revalued, the total carrying amounts of revalued properties as at 31 December 2022 would have been as follows:

|                             | 2022      | 2021      |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Leasehold land              | 8,730,369 | 8,730,369 |
| Buildings on leasehold land | 6,399,816 | 6,666,180 |

10.4 The cost of fully depreciated fixed assets that are still in use is as follows:

|   | Furniture and fixture | Electrical, office and computer equipment | Vehicles | Improvements to leasehold buildings |

# 36.14 Funding Policy

The Bank will fund the yearly contribution to the defined benefit plan each year, as per the amount calculated by the valuer.

# 36.15 Significant Risk

# Asset Volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Fund is almost entirely invested in Government Bonds with mostly fixed income bonds. Almost 65.43% of the total Investments (Rs. 3.429 billion) is invested in PIB's. This gives rise to significant reinvestment risk.

The remaining fund is invested in Treasury Bills. The T-Bills exposure is almost 34.17% (Rs. 1.790 billion). The asset class is volatile with reference to the yield on this class. This risk should be viewed together with change in the bond yield risk.

# Changes in Bond Yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in bond yields will lower the gratuity liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.


# Life Expectancy / Withdrawal Rate

The gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes:

# Model Risk

The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the gratuity fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.

# Retention Risk

The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.

# Final Salary Risk

The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.

# Operational Risk related to a Separate Entity

Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.

# Compliance Risk

The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.

# Legal / Political Risk

The risk that the legal / political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

# 39. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government securities: PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Foreign securities: Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed securities: Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Mutual funds: Net asset values declared by respective funds
- Unlisted equity investments: Break-up value as per latest available audited financial statements

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities. The provision for impairment of debt securities and loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policies as stated in notes 4.13 and 4.4.

# 39.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 44. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Bank has a risk management framework commensurate with its size and the nature of its business. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies covering key areas of activities for the guidance of management and committees of the Board, management committees, and Divisions / Departments of the Bank.

This section presents information about the Bank’s exposure to and its management and control of risks, in particular the primary risks associated with its use of financial instruments.

# 44.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from failure by a client or counterparty to meet its contractual obligation. It emanates from loans and advances, commitments to lend, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and other similar transactions both on and off balance sheet.

The objective of credit risk management is to keep credit risk exposure within permissible level, relevant to the Bank’s risk capital, to maintain the soundness of assets and to ensure returns commensurate with risk.

Credit risk of the Bank is managed through the credit policy approved by the Board, a well-defined credit approval mechanism, prescribed documentation requirement, post disbursement administration, review and monitoring of all credit facilities, and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank's credit risk.

Counterparty exposure limits are approved in line with the Prudential Regulations and the Bank's own Policies by taking into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria. There is an established system for continuous monitoring of credit exposures and follow - up of any past due loans with the respective business units. All past due loans, including trade bills, are reviewed on fortnightly basis and pursued for recovery. Any non-performing loans are classified and provided for as per Prudential Regulations.



The Bank has also established a mechanism for independent post-disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Credit facilities, both fund based and non-fund based, extended to large customer groups and industrial sectors are regularly monitored. The Bank has concentration of credit in textiles which is the largest sector of Pakistan's economy. Concentration risk is managed by diversification within sub-sectors like spinning, weaving and composites etc.

Credit Administration Department (CAD) is primarily responsible for custody, monitoring, and maintenance of security that underlies the bank’s credit portfolio. CAD is also responsible for ensuring that all required terms and conditions as per approvals are properly reflected in customer documentation.

The Bank has implemented its own internal risk rating system for the credit portfolio, as per guidelines of SBP. Credit ratings by external rating agencies, if available, are also considered.

Generally, the Bank primarily lends against cash flows, which is considered the primary source of repayment. However, if cash flows of a borrower deteriorate and are insufficient to service debt obligations, collateral serves as the secondary recourse of repayment.

Specific and general provisions on the credit portfolio are determined in accordance with Prudential Regulations. The Bank maintains additional general provision in line with its prudent policies and as per IFRS 9 for overseas branches. Particulars of provisions against advances are given in note 9.4.

The Bank uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation. Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non-performing loans and downward shift in these categories.

# 44.2   Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.

The Bank takes positions in securities for the purpose of investment and not to run a trading book, except to a very limited extent (maximum of Rs. 300 million) for trading in equities. As regards foreign exchange positions, the purpose is to serve the needs of clients. Except as aforesaid, the Bank does not engage in trading or market making activities.

Market risk is managed through the Market Risk Policy and Treasury and Investment Policy approved by the Board, approval of counterparty and dealer limits, specific senior management approval for each investment and regular review and monitoring of the investment portfolio by the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). A key element of the Bank’s market risk management is to balance safety, liquidity, and income in that order of priority. Another key element is separation of functions and reporting lines for the Treasury Division and Equity Market Department, which undertake dealing activities within the limits and parameters set by ALCO, Settlements Department which confirms and settles the aforesaid deals, and Middle Office which independently monitors and analyses the risks inherent in treasury operations. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s market risk.

Dealing activities of the Bank include investment in government securities, term finance certificates, sukuks / bonds, shares and mutual funds, money market transactions and foreign exchange transactions catering to the needs of its customers. All such activities are carried out within the prescribed limits. Any excess over limits noted by the Settlements Department and / or the Middle Office is reported to senior management and ALCO. Stress testing is performed as per guidelines of SBP as well as Bank's internal policy. Portfolio risks arising in banking book are also measured through Value at Risk (VAR).

# 44.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in currency exchange rates. The Bank’s foreign exchange exposure comprises forward contracts, purchase of foreign bills, foreign currency loans and investments, foreign currency cash in hand, balances with banks abroad, foreign currency deposits and foreign currency placements with SBP and other banks. Focus of the Bank’s foreign exchange activities is on catering to the needs of its customers, both in spot and forward markets. Foreign exchange risk exposures of the Bank are controlled through dealer limits, open foreign exchange position limits, counterparty exposure limits, and country limits. The Bank manages its foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency assets and liabilities within strict limits. The net open position in any single currency and the overall foreign exchange exposure are both managed within the statutory limits as prescribed by SBP as well as the internal limits set by the Bank itself. Stress testing for foreign exchange risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.

# 44.2.3 Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in equity prices. The Bank’s policy is to take equity positions for investment purposes and not to run a trading book, except to a very limited extent (maximum of Rs. 300 million) for trading in equities.

Equity position risk of the Bank is controlled through equity portfolio limits, sector limits, scrip limits, and future contracts limits. Direct investment in equities and mutual funds is managed within the statutory limits as prescribed by SBP as well as the internal limits set by the Bank itself. Stress testing for equity price risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in stock prices. The Bank invests mainly in blue chip securities.

# 44.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in interest rates. ALCO monitors and manages the interest rate risk with the objective of limiting the potential adverse effects on the profitability of the Bank arising from fluctuation in the market interest rates and mismatching or gaps in the amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in different maturity time bands.

The Bank's interest rate exposure is calculated by categorising its interest sensitive assets and liabilities into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates.




# Interest rate risk exposures of the Bank

Interest rate risk exposures of the Bank are controlled through dealer limits, counter-party exposure limits and (when necessary) type-of-instrument limits. Outright purchase and sale of securities are also approved by ALCO. Duration and modified duration of various types of debt securities as well as their entire portfolio are also calculated, and the impact of adverse change in interest rates on the market value of the securities is estimated. Stress testing for interest rate risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates.

# Interest rate / yield risk in the banking book – Basel Specific

The Bank holds financial assets and financial liabilities with different maturities or repricing dates and linked to different benchmark rates, thus creating exposure to unexpected changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk in the banking book refers to the risk associated with interest-bearing financial instruments that are not held in the trading book of the Bank.

Repricing gap analysis presents the Bank’s Interest Sensitive Assets (ISA) and Interest Sensitive Liabilities (ISL), categorised into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates (or settlement dates for off-balance sheet instruments). Deposits with no fixed maturity dates (for example, saving deposits and treasurer’s call deposits) are included in the lowest, one-month time band, but these are not expected to be payable within a one-month period. The difference between ISA and ISL for each time band signifies the gap in that time band, and provides a workable framework for determining the impact on net interest income.

The Bank reviews the repricing gap analysis periodically to monitor and manage interest rate risk in the banking book.

# 44.3   Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. Bank classifies operational loss / near miss incidents into seven loss incidents types, which are Internal Fraud, External Fraud, Employment Practice & Workplace Safety, Client, Product & Business Practice, Damage to Physical Assets, Business Disruption & System Failure, and Execution, Delivery & Process Management.

Operational risk is managed through the Operational Risk Policy, Internal Control System and Internal Audit Policy, Compliance Policy & Programme, Information Technology (I.T.) Policy, I.T. Governance and Risk Management Framework, I.T. Security Policy, Human Resource Policy, Consumer Protection Framework, KYC / CDD Policy, AML / CFT and CPF Policy, Fraud Prevention Policy, Service Quality and Consumer Grievance Handling Policy, Business Continuity Management Policy and Outsourcing Policy approved by the Board, along with the operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; system of internal controls; Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Operational risk related matters are discussed in the operations committee, compliance committee of management and I.T. steering committee. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s operational risk.

The Bank’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the operational risk policy, permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organisational learning and the future needs of the Bank.

The Bank places a high priority on conducting all business dealings with integrity and fairness, as laid down in the Code of Conduct, which is required to be complied with by all employees.


Internal controls are an essential feature of risk reduction in operational risk management and the Bank continues to improve its internal controls.

Business Continuity Plan of the Bank pays special attention to identification of potential threats and associated risks in critical business processes by carrying out Business Impact Analysis and Risk Assessment including those which are dependent on external vendors or third parties, identification of alternative mechanisms for timely resumption of services, with special focus on critical business processes, location of off-site backup & regular review and testing of the plan.

Bank AL Habib’s internet banking platform, both web and mobile based applications are successfully implemented and regularly enhanced to provide better customer experience.

The Bank has zero tolerance for Cybersecurity risks and non-compliance to regulations. Monitoring controls and processes have been implemented to identify and appropriately address Cybersecurity risks. Long term measures are defined in Cyber Security Strategy that is supported by a complementing Action Plan. While Information Security Risk Management plan covers measures for identifying the risks posed to Information Systems in alignment with bank’s strategy. I.T. Security has developed a cyber secure environment by implementing various technical and administrative controls to ensure security of customers’ data residing with the bank. In this regard, Bank is also in process of implementing industrial standards and best practices for Information Security assurance.

# 44.3.1 Operational Risk-Disclosures Basel II Specific

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach to calculate capital charge for operational risk as per Basel regulatory framework. This approach is considered to be most suitable in view of the business model of the Bank which relies on an extensive network of branches to offer one-stop, full-service banking to its clients. The Bank has developed and implemented an Operational Loss Database. Operational loss and "near miss" events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve security and control procedures. Key Risk Indicators have also been developed along with thresholds which are being closely monitored for breaches. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems or any significant change in the existing product, processes and systems as per the operational risk policy of the Bank.

# 44.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to a bank arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund growth in assets, without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Key elements of the Bank’s liquidity risk management are as follows:

- To maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet the Bank’s funding requirements at any time.
- To keep a strong focus on mobilization of low-cost core deposits from customers.
- To maintain a realistic balance between the behavioral maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.
- To maintain excellent credit rating (as borrowing cost and ability to raise funds are directly affected by credit rating).
- To have a written contingency funding plan to address any hypothetical situations when access to normal sources of funding is constrained.

# 44.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio

SBP issued BPRD Circular No. 08 dated June 23, 2016 advising implementation of Basel III liquidity standards that constitute two ratios, i.e., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and five monitoring tools.

LCR is the measure of conversion capability of the Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) into cash to meet immediate liquidity requirements over a 30 days horizon.

The Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on monthly basis as per the guidelines given in the above mentioned circular. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile which requires the Bank to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-days period. As of 31 December 2022, the Bank’s LCR stood at 252% against the SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.



# 44.4.2 Governance of Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is managed through the liquidity risk policy approved by the Board. The Bank has “zero tolerance” for liquidity risk and will continue to maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet its funding requirements at any time.

Management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BOD)
- Risk Management Committee
- Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
- Treasury Division
- Risk Management Division and Middle Office
- Finance Division
- Information Technology Division

The Board of Directors approves the liquidity risk policy and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the Risk Management Committee of the Board, that the Bank’s liquidity risk is being managed prudently. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Bank’s liquidity risk. Liquidity position is monitored daily by the Treasury Division and the Middle Office and reviewed regularly by ALCO.

# 44.4.3 Funding Strategy

The Bank’s prime source of liquidity is the customers' deposit base. Within deposits, the Bank strives to maintain core deposit base in form of current and saving deposits and avoids concentration in particular products, tenors and dependence on large fund providers. As a general rule, the Bank will not depend on borrowings in the inter-bank market, including repos, to be a part of its permanent pool of funds for financing of loans, but will use these as a source for obtaining moderate amounts of additional funds to meet temporary liquidity needs in the normal course of business or for money market operations.

# 44.4.4 Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like core deposits to total deposits, advances to deposits, liquid assets to total deposits, Interbank borrowing to total deposits, which are monitored on regular basis against limits. Further, the Bank also prepares the maturity profile of assets and liabilities to monitor the liquidity gaps over different time bands. For maturity analysis, behavioral study is carried out to determine the behavior of non-contractual assets and liabilities. The Bank also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times.

In addition, LCR, NSFR and Monitoring Tools of Basel III framework further strengthen liquidity risk management of the Bank.

# 44.4.5 Liquidity Stress Testing

As per SBP FSD Circular No. 01 of 2020, Liquidity stress testing is being conducted under various stress scenarios. Shocks include the withdrawals of deposits, withdrawals of wholesale / large deposits & interbank borrowing, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. Results of stress testing are presented to ALCO and Risk Management Committee. The Bank’s liquidity risk management addresses the goal of protecting solvency and the ability to withstand stressful events in the market place. Stress testing for liquidity as prescribed in the liquidity risk policy is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in liquidity on the ratio of liquid assets to deposits plus borrowings.

# 44.4.6 Contingency Funding Plan

Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk policy of the Bank which identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity contingency and describes the actions to be taken to manage it. The contingency funding plan highlights liquidity management actions that needs to be taken to deal with the contingency. Responsibilities and response levels are also incorporated in order to tackle the contingency. Moreover, CFP highlights possible funding sources, in case of a liquidity contingency.

# 44.4.7 Main Components of LCR

Main components of LCR are High Quality Liquid Assets and Net Cash Outflows. Outflows are mainly deposit outflows net of cash inflows which consist of inflows from financing and money market placements up to 1 month. The inputs for calculation of LCR are based on SBP BPRD Circular No. 08 dated 23 June 2016.

# 44.4.8 Composition of HQLAs

High Quality Liquid Assets consist of Level 1 Assets which are included in the stock of liquid assets at 100% weightage of their market value i.e., Cash & Treasury balances, Conventional Government Securities, GOP Ijarah Sukuks, Foreign Currency Sukuks & Bonds issued by sovereigns. While Level 2 Assets comprise all equity shares (excluding shares of Financial Institutions) listed on PSX 100.

# 44.4.9 Concentration of Funding Sources

The Bank relies on customers' deposits as its key source of funding, especially current and saving deposits and time deposits of small / medium denominations, and avoids concentration of large deposits. Share of core deposits in total deposits and of large deposits in total deposits are regularly monitored. In particular the Bank does not depend on large depositors or borrowings from SBP and financial institutions to meet its funding requirements.

# 44.4.10 Currency Mismatch in the LCR

About 90% of the Bank's assets and liabilities are in local currency. Currency mismatch in other currencies is regularly monitored.

# 44.4.11 Centralisation of Liquidity Management

Overall liquidity management of the Bank is centralised in Treasury Division at Principal Office. The Bank mobilises deposits through its branch network. It also uses the branch network to grant loans to customers. Branches that have more deposits than loans, transfer (“lend”) their excess deposits to the Principal Office. Branches that do not have enough deposits to fund their loans, acquire (“borrow”) additional funds from the Principal Office.

# 44.4.12 Other Inflows & Outflows

Benefit of pledged deposits (deposits under lien) are not accounted for in calculation of LCR.

# 44.4.13 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

NSFR is the ratio of the amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) - source of funds, capital and liabilities relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF) - use of funds, assets and off - balance sheet exposures.

The objective of NSFR is to ensure the availability of stable funds that a bank must hold to enable it to build and maintain its assets, investments and off balance sheet portfolio on an ongoing basis for longer term, i.e., over a one year horizon. NSFR reduces maturity mismatches between the asset and liability items on the balance sheet and thereby reduces funding and roll - over risk. The Bank’s NSFR stood at 179% as on 31 December 2022.

# 44.5 Maturities of Assets and Liabilities

based on contractual maturity of the assets and liabilities of the Bank

The following maturity profile is based on contractual maturities for assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised in the shortest maturity band.

# 44.6 Maturities of assets and liabilities - based on expected maturities of the assets and liabilities of the Bank

For assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity, the expected maturity is considered to be the same as contractual maturity. Assets and Liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised on the basis of expected maturities as determined by ALCO. In case of saving and current accounts, their historical net withdrawal pattern over the next one year was reviewed, based on year-end balances for the last three years. Thereafter, taking a conservative view, ALCO categorised these deposits in various maturity bands. Other assets and liabilities have been categorised on the basis of assumptions / judgments that are believed to be reasonable.

# Parameters associated with risk and rewards

Following are the key considerations attached with risk and reward of the pool:

- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organizations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules & Shariah clearance.

# 9.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudaraba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / business:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk, shares and mutual funds
- Production and transmission of energy

# 9.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (2021: 50%) of Net Income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (2021: 50%) of Net Income.

After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

Complaint Handling

# Complaint Handling

Under the umbrella of Customer Service Division, Complaint Management is primarily in control of upholding high FTC (Fair Treatment to Customers) standards by promptly resolving complaints and providing fair resolutions to customers.

To promote customers centricity in the culture and dynamics of BAHL, we have developed a comprehensive policy for handling customer complaints that is established on the values of fairness, transparency, promptness, visibility, and accessibility. BAHL takes complaints as an effective measure to improve its services instead of considering complaints as root cause for customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, Fair Treatment to Consumers Committee (FTCC) is established to anticipate customer problems and recommend resolution that can give our customers a better experience.

In order to ensure that customer concerns are quickly resolved, Bank’s customer complaint unit has been enhanced further during 2022. Additionally, training sessions have been conducted to emphasize complaint management procedures and guidelines throughout the bank.

Customers can register complaints through a variety of channels, including a call center, the bank’s website, direct emails, social media, and letters delivered directly or through drop box to the customer services division. These complaints are swiftly recorded in the complaint management system. From the time a complaint is acknowledged until it is resolved, the bank has a defined escalation matrix to resolve complaints, where if any complaint is not resolved within the allotted turnaround time, it is escalated to the next senior level of management to ensure resolution of the complaints on priority.

As a post resolution activity, the complaint trends and analysis are shared with Board Members, Senior Management and Business Segments. Based on the findings, root cause analysis is conducted and communicated timely with the relevant departments for reduction of customer grievance.

# Key Highlight

In 2022, the Bank received 383,488 complaints about 77% higher than the previous year. The complaints were investigated and closed within an average turnaround time of 4 working days.

| (a) For filers of income tax returns     | 15% |
| ---------------------------------------- | --- |

According to FBR, withholding tax will be determined separately on ‘Filer/Non-Filer’ status of principal shareholder as well as joint-shareholder(s) based on their shareholding proportions, in case of joint accounts. Members that hold shares with joint-shareholder(s) are requested to provide shareholding proportions of principal shareholder and joint-shareholder(s) in respect of shares held by them to the Bank’s Share Registrar in writing in the following format.

| Bank Name | Folio/CDC Account No. | Total Shares | Principal Shareholder Name | Shareholding Proportion (No. of Shares) | Joint-Shareholder(s) Name | Shareholding Proportion (No. of Shares) |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
|           |                       |              |                            |                                         |                           |                                         |

- We obtained an understanding of the accounting policies and the impairment framework used by the Bank for determining impairment / ECL provisions against this portfolio.
- We assessed ECL methodologies implemented by the Bank in relation to this portfolio by reference to the requirements of IFRS 9. In this regard, we focused on the sources of information underlying the credit ratings and Probability of default assumptions, together with consistency in the application of ECL model.
- In respect of defaulted sovereign bonds, we considered the publicly available information about the countries’ economic conditions, market prices observed post default and available currently.
- We also discussed, with the auditors of overseas operations regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of impairment / ECL provisions, made by the Bank, in line with the applicable regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdictions.
- We also obtained reports from independent auditors of the relevant jurisdictions based on International Standards of Auditing.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 8.3.1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing investments and provisions made for the same in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |



# Key audit matter

# 2. Provision against Non Performing loans and advances

The Group’s advances portfolio represents 35.78% of its total assets as of 31 December 2022. A substantial portion of the advances portfolio includes loans and advances to businesses operating in diverse sectors of the economy.

As per the Group’s accounting policy (refer note 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements), the Group determines provisions against non-performing advances exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning for loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Group’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision therefore, involve use of management judgment, on a case to case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Group.

In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the consolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of provision against advances as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter.

The accounting policy and disclosures relating to provisioning against non-performing advances are included in note 4.5 and 9 respectively to the consolidated financial statements.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

We applied a range of audit procedures including the following:

- We reviewed the Group’s process for identification and classification of non-performing advances. As part of such review we performed an analysis of the changes within the different categories of classified non-performing accounts from last year to the current reporting date. This analysis was used to gather audit evidence regarding downgrading of impaired advances and declassification of accounts from non-performing to regular and vice versa, as the case may be.
- We have performed procedures on test basis for the computations of provisions to assess that the same is in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations;
- In addition, we selected a representative sample of borrowers from the advances portfolios including individually significant credit facilities and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Group and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower;
- In respect of the level of general provision maintained by the Group, we discussed the approach and policy followed by the Group with the management and the regulatory approvals in place for such policy.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing advances and provisions made for the same in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.


# Independent Auditors’ Report


• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Arslan Khalid.

Further, SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated 05 July 2022 directed the Banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' with effect from 01 January 2023. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

# 2.7

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

# 2.7.1 IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'

Regulatory Framework applicable to the banking sector

As per SBP BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022, the effective date for the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is accounting period beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As part of the same circular, SBP has issued detailed instructions on the application of the Standard, including transitional provisions, impact on the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) calculation and reporting requirements.

The IFRS 9 application instructions and guidelines that have been issued as part of the circular include the following key components:

- a) Basis for classification and measurement of debt and equity securities;
- b) Framework for determination of “Expected Credit Losses (ECL)” under the requirements of IFRS 9, including required risk management policies;
- c) Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities have been exempted from the application of the above ECL Framework;
- d) In respect of non-performing exposures (Stage 3 exposures) provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements;
- e) In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital and fully described in Annexure B to the aforementioned circular.

The State Bank of Pakistan vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023 has issued revised formats for interim and annual financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from January 01, 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures on adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022. The estimated ECL adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at January 1, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 1,717 million (without considering general provisions already held).

As at 31 December 2022, the management is carrying a general provision of Rs. 5,750 million (before tax) against loans / advances portfolio on prudent basis. After IFRS 9 implementation, the management of the Bank may decide on the amount of management ECL overlay out of the general provision already held.

# 2.8 Critical accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis of making judgment about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements are in respect of the following:

# 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year.

# 4.1 Basis of consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the control commences until the date the control ceases. In preparing consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of the Holding Company and subsidiaries are consolidated on a line by line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated.

Non-controlling interest are part of results of operations and net assets of the subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Holding Company. Interest in the equity of the subsidiaries not attributable to the Holding Company is reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity as non-controlling interest. Profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interest is reported in the consolidated profit and loss account as profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interest.

# 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents as referred to in the consolidated cash flow statement comprise cash and non-restricted balances with treasury and other banks less overdrawn nostros accounts. Restricted balances not available for use if any, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.

# 4.3 Lendings to / borrowings from financial institutions

The Bank enters into transactions of lendings and borrowings at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

Sale under repurchase obligation

Securities sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repos) continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position and are measured in accordance with accounting policies for investments. Amounts received under these agreements are recorded as repurchase agreement borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price is amortised as expense over the term of the repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds received and subsequently reported as payable under the contractual terms.

Purchase under resale obligation

Securities purchased with a corresponding commitment to resale at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position. Amounts paid under these arrangements are included in repurchase agreement lendings. The difference between purchase and resale price is accrued as income over the term of the reverse repo agreement. These are initially recognised at amount of funds disbursed and subsequently reported as receivable under the contractual terms.

These are investments which do not fall under held for trading and held to maturity categories.

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Investments (other than held for trading) are initially measured at fair value plus transaction cost associated with the investment. Investments classified as held for trading are initially measured at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the profit and loss account.

After initial recognition, quoted securities (other than those classified as held to maturity) are carried at market value. Unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment in value, if any. Held to maturity securities are carried at amortised cost.

Surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as 'available-for-sale', is included in the statement of comprehensive income and is shown in the statement of financial position as part of equity. The surplus / (deficit) arising on these securities is taken to the profit and loss account when actually realised upon disposal or in case of impairment of securities. The unrealised surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as held for trading is taken to the profit and loss account.

Premium or discount on debt securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity is amortised using effective interest method and taken to the profit and loss account.

Details of valuation techniques used in determination of fair value is included in note 40 of consolidated financial statements.

# Investments in associates

Under the equity method, the investments in associates are initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates since the acquisition date. The profit and loss account reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associates. Any change in OCI of associates is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associates, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.

# 4.5 Advances

# Loans and advances

These are stated net of provisions for non - performing advances.

# Receivables against lease finance where Bank is a lessor (other than Ijarah)

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value.

# Islamic Financing and Related Assets

# Ijarah finance

Assets leased out under ijarah arrangements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Such assets are depreciated over the terms of ijarah contracts.


# Murabaha

Funds disbursed under murabaha arrangements for purchase of goods are recorded as advance for murabaha. On culmination of murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, murabaha receivables are recorded at the sale price net of deferred income. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the reporting date are recorded as inventories.

# Inventory

The Bank values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Bank / customers as an agent of the Bank for subsequent sale. Inventory against each contract is maintained on specific identification method.

# Istisna

In Istisna financing, the Bank places an order to purchase some specific goods / commodities from its customers to be delivered to the Bank within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount hence financed is paid back to the Bank.

# Diminishing Musharaka

In Diminishing Musharaka financing, the Bank enters into Musharaka based on Shirkat-ul-milk for financing an agreed share of fixed asset (e.g. house, land, plant or machinery) with its customers and enters into periodic rental payment agreement for the utilisation of the Bank’s Musharaka share by the customer. The customer purchases the Bank's share gradually as per his undertaking.

# Running Musharaka

In Running Musharaka financing, the Bank enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat-ul-Aqd or Business Partnership in customers operating business. Under this mechanism the customer can withdraw and return funds to the Bank subject to his Running Musharakah Financing limit during the Musharakah period. At the end of each quarter / half year the customer pays the provisional profit as per the desired profit rate which is subject to final settlement based on the relevant quarterly / half-yearly / annual accounts of the customer.

# Musawama

In Musawama financing, the Bank purchases specific goods / commodities on cash basis from its customer for onward sale. Upon realisation of sale proceeds, the finance is adjusted.

# Provision for non-performing advances

Provision for non-performing advances is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations for domestic branches, whereas requirements of respective central banks is followed in respect of overseas branches and is charged to the profit and loss account. The Bank also maintains general provision in addition to the requirements of the Prudential Regulations on the basis of the management's risk assessment.

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess amount of non-performing loans and determine provision required there against. While assessing this requirement various factors including the past dues, delinquency in the account, financial position and future business / financial plan of the borrower, value of collateral held and requirements of Prudential Regulations are considered. The Bank is allowed to consider the effect of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collaterals in determining the amount of provision, however, no benefit of FSV of collateral is taken in determining provisioning amount.

The amount of general provision against domestic consumer and SME advances is determined in accordance with the relevant / Prudential Regulations and SBP directives.

For overseas operations, the Bank records an allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (all referred to as ‘financial instruments’). The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the Lifetime Expected Credit Losses or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ Expected Credit Losses (12mECL).

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

Advances are written-off when there is no realistic prospects of recovery.



# 4.6 Operating fixed assets and depreciation

# Capital work in progress

Capital work in progress is stated at cost less impairment, if any.

# Property and equipment - owned

Land is measured at cost at the time of initial recognition and is subsequently carried at revalued amount less impairment, if any. Buildings are initially measured at cost and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. All other operating fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is charged to profit and loss account on straight line basis so as to charge the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2. The depreciation charge is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. Depreciation is charged on prorata basis, i.e., full month charge in the month of purchase and no charge in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from the fair value. The valuations involve estimates / assumptions and various market factors and conditions. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and buildings, except to the extent that it reversal of a deficit already charged to profit and loss account on the same asset. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in profit and loss account, except for a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets are included in income currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The right-of-use assets are presented within note 10 fixed assets and are subject to impairment in line with the Group’s policy as described in note 4.14 impairment of non-financial assets.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental lending rate to measure lease liabilities.

# 4. Intangible assets

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Amortisation is based on straight line method by taking into consideration the estimated useful life of assets at the rates specified in note 11. Intangible assets are amortised on prorata basis i.e. full month amortisation in the month of purchase and no amortisation in the month of disposal.

# 4.7 Non - banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially measured at settlement amount and upon revaluation, are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. The useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued as per SBP's requirement by independent professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of assets is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title of assets is charged to profit and loss account and not capitalised.

# 4.8 Borrowings / deposits

Borrowings / deposits are recorded at the amount of proceeds received. The cost of borrowings / deposits is recognised on an accrual basis as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Deposits mobilized under Islamic Banking operations are generated under two modes i.e. “Qard” and “Modaraba”. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as ‘Current accounts’ and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as ‘Saving deposits / Fixed deposits / Current remunerative deposits’.

# 4.9 Subordinated debt

Subordinated debt is initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received and subsequently reported at outstanding amounts as a financial liability. Mark - up accrued on subordinated debt is recognised separately as part of other liabilities and is charged to the profit and loss account over the period on an accrual basis.

# 4.10 Employees' benefits

# Defined benefit plan

The Bank operates an approved gratuity fund for all its confirmed employees, which is administered by the Trustees. The Bank's costs and contributions are determined based on actuarial valuation carried out at each year end using Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Method. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in 'other comprehensive income' as they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods. The liabilities for employees' benefits plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets and future salary increases as disclosed in note 37. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

# Defined contribution plan

The Bank operates an approved provident fund scheme for all its regular permanent employees, administered by the Trustees. Equal monthly contributions are made both by the Bank and its employees to the fund at the rate of 10% of the basic salary in accordance with the terms of the scheme.

10.3 In accordance with the Bank's accounting policy, the Bank's leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land were revalued at 01 June 2020. The revaluation was carried out by an independent valuer, M/s. Iqbal A. Nanjee & Co. on the basis of present physical condition and location of leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land. Fair values were ascertained by the independent valuer under market approach through various enquiries conducted by them at site from real estate agents and brokers. The revaluation resulted in surplus of Rs. 3,618.097 million over the book value of the respective properties and also net deficit of Rs. 122.190 million on certain properties. Had the leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land not been revalued, the total carrying amounts of revalued properties as at 31 December 2022 would have been as follows:

|                             | 2022      | 2021      |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------- |

| Buildings on leasehold land | 6,399,816 | 6,666,180 |

10.4 The gross carrying amount of fully depreciated assets still in use is as follows:

# 37. DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

# 37.1 General description

The Bank operates an approved gratuity fund for all its confirmed employees, which is administered by the Trustees. The benefits under the gratuity scheme are payable on retirement at the age of 60 years or on earlier cessation of service as under:

| Number of years of eligible service completed: | Amount of gratuity payable:                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Less than 5 years                              | Nil                                        |
| 5 years or more but less than 10 years         | 1/3rd of basic salary for each year served |
| 10 years or more but less than 15 years        | 2/3rd of basic salary for each year served |
| 15 years or more                               | Full basic salary for each year served     |

The Bank's costs and contributions are determined based on actuarial valuation carried out at each year end using Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Method. All actuarial gains / losses are recognised in 'other comprehensive income' as they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss account in subsequent periods.

# 37.14 Funding Policy

The Bank will fund the yearly contribution to the defined benefit plan each year, as per the amount calculated by the valuer.

# 37.15 Significant Risk

# Asset Volatility

The Defined Benefit Gratuity Fund is almost entirely invested in Government Bonds with mostly fixed income bonds. Almost 65.43% of the total Investments (Rs. 3.429 billion) is invested in PIB's. This gives rise to significant reinvestment risk.

The remaining fund is invested in Treasury Bills. The T-Bills exposure is almost 34.17% (Rs. 1.790 billion). The asset class is volatile with reference to the yield on this class. This risk should be viewed together with change in the bond yield risk.

# Changes in Bond Yields

There are two dimensions to the changes in bond yields: first, as described above; second, the valuation of the gratuity liability is discounted with reference to these bond yields. So any increase in bond yields will lower the gratuity liability and vice versa, but, it will also lower the asset values.

# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the gratuity fund liability carries. In a general economic sense and in a longer view, there is a case that if bond yields increase, the change in salary inflation generally offsets the gains from the decrease in discounted gratuity liability. But viewed with the fact that asset values will also decrease, the salary inflation does, as an overall affect, increases the net liability of the Bank.


# Life Expectancy / Withdrawal Rate

The gratuity is paid off at the maximum of age 60. The life expectancy is in almost minimal range and is quite predictable in the ages when the employee is in the accredited employment of the Bank for the purpose of the gratuity. Thus, the risk of life expectancy is almost negligible. However, had a post retirement benefit been given by the Bank like monthly pension, post retirement medical etc., this would have been a significant risk which would have been quite difficult to value even by using advance mortality improvement models.

The withdrawal risk is dependent upon the: benefit structure; age and retention profile of the staff; the valuation methodology; and long-term valuation assumptions.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallize. This includes:

# Model Risk

The defined benefit gratuity liability is usually actuarially valued each year. Further, the assets in the gratuity fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.

# Retention Risk

The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.

# Final Salary Risk

The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.

# Operational Risk related to a Separate Entity

Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.

# Compliance Risk

The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank does not comply with minimum statutory requirements.

# Legal / Political Risk

The risk that the legal / political environment changes and the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected.

# DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The general description of the plan is included in note 4.10.

# 40. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government securities - PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Foreign securities - Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed securities - Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Mutual funds - Net asset values declared by respective funds
- Unlisted equity investments - Break-up value as per latest available audited financial statements

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities. The provision for impairment of debt securities and loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group's accounting policies as stated in notes 4.14 and 4.5.

# 40.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR)

The MCR standard sets the paid-up capital that the Bank is required to hold at all times. As of the statement of financial position date, the Bank's paid-up capital stands at Rs. 11.114 billion as against the required MCR of Rs. 10 billion.

# Minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)

The CAR on the basis of above framework works out to be as follows:

|                    | 2022         | 2021    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------- |

- Credit Risk: Standardised Approach
- Market Risk: Standardised Approach
- Operational Risk: Basic Indicator Approach

# 45. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has a risk management framework commensurate with its size and the nature of its business. The Board of Directors has approved risk management policies covering key areas of activities for the guidance of management and committees of the Board, management committees, and Divisions / Departments of the Group.

This section presents information about the Group’s exposure to and its management and control of risks, in particular the primary risks associated with its use of financial instruments.

# 45.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from failure by a client or counterparty to meet its contractual obligation. It emanates from loans and advances, commitments to lend, contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, and other similar transactions both on and off balance sheet.

The objective of credit risk management is to keep credit risk exposure within permissible level, relevant to the Group’s risk capital, to maintain the soundness of assets and to ensure returns commensurate with risk. Credit risk of the Group is managed through the credit policy approved by the Board, a well-defined credit approval mechanism, prescribed documentation requirement, post disbursement administration, review and monitoring of all credit facilities, and continuous assessment of credit worthiness of counterparties. Decisions regarding the credit portfolio are taken mainly by the Central Credit Committee. Credit Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group's credit risk.

Counterparty exposure limits are approved in line with the Prudential Regulations and the Group's own Policies by taking into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria. There is an established system for continuous monitoring of credit exposures and follow - up of any past due loans with the respective business units. All past due loans, including trade bills, are reviewed on fortnightly basis and pursued for recovery. Any non-performing loans are classified and provided for as per Prudential Regulations.

The Group has also established a mechanism for independent post - disbursement review of large credit risk exposures. Credit facilities, both fund based and non - fund based, extended to large customer groups and industrial sectors are regularly monitored. The Group has concentration of credit in textiles which is the largest sector of Pakistan's economy. Concentration risk is managed by diversification within sub - sectors like spinning, weaving and composites etc.




Credit Administration Department (CAD) is primarily responsible for custody, monitoring, and maintenance of security that underlies the Group’s credit portfolio. CAD is also responsible for ensuring that all required terms and conditions as per approvals are properly reflected in customer documentation.

The Group has implemented its own internal risk rating system for the credit portfolio, as per guidelines of SBP. Credit ratings by external rating agencies, if available, are also considered.

Generally, the Group primarily lends against cash flows, which is considered the primary source of repayment. However, if cash flows of a borrower deteriorate and are insufficient to service debt obligations, collateral serves as the secondary recourse of repayment.

Specific and general provisions on the credit portfolio are determined in accordance with Prudential Regulations. The Group maintains additional general provision in line with its prudent policies and as per IFRS 9 for overseas branches. Particulars of provisions against advances are given in note 9.4.

The Group uses the Standardised Approach to calculate capital charge for credit risk as per Basel regulatory framework, with comprehensive approach for credit risk mitigation.

Stress testing for credit risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of increase in non – performing loans and downward shift in these categories.

# 45.2.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse movements in interest rates. ALCO monitors and manages the interest rate risk with the objective of limiting the potential adverse effects on the profitability of the Group arising from fluctuation in the market interest rates and mismatching or gaps in the amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in different maturity time bands.




# Interest Rate Risk Management

The Group's interest rate exposure is calculated by categorising its interest sensitive assets and liabilities into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates. Interest rate risk exposures of the Group are controlled through dealer limits, counter-party exposure limits and (when necessary) type-of-instrument limits. Outright purchase and sale of securities are also approved by ALCO. Duration and modified duration of various types of debt securities as well as their entire portfolio are also calculated, and the impact of adverse change in interest rates on the market value of the securities is estimated. Stress testing for interest rate risk is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates.

# Interest rate / yield risk in the banking book – Basel Specific

The Group holds financial assets and financial liabilities with different maturities or repricing dates and linked to different benchmark rates, thus creating exposure to unexpected changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk in the banking book refers to the risk associated with interest-bearing financial instruments that are not held in the trading book of the Group.

Repricing gap analysis presents the Group’s Interest Sensitive Assets (ISA) and Interest Sensitive Liabilities (ISL), categorised into various time bands based on the earlier of their contractual repricing or maturity dates (or settlement dates for off-balance sheet instruments). Deposits with no fixed maturity dates (for example, saving deposits and treasurer’s call deposits) are included in the lowest, one-month time band, but these are not expected to be payable within a one-month period. The difference between ISA and ISL for each time band signifies the gap in that time band, and provides a workable framework for determining the impact on net interest income.

The Group reviews the repricing gap analysis periodically to monitor and manage interest rate risk in the banking book.

# 45.3 Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risks. Group classifies operational loss / near miss incidents into seven loss incidents types, which are Internal Fraud, External Fraud, Employment Practice & Workplace Safety, Client, Product & Business Practice, Damage to Physical Assets, Business Disruption & System Failure, and Execution, Delivery & Process Management.

Operational risk is managed through the Operational Risk Policy, Internal Control System and Internal Audit Policy, Compliance Policy & Programme, Information Technology (I.T.) Policy, I.T. Governance and Risk Management Framework, I.T. Security Policy, Human Resource Policy, Consumer Protection Framework, KYC / CDD Policy, AML / CFT and CPF Policy, Fraud Prevention Policy, Service Quality and Consumer Grievance Handling Policy, Business Continuity Management Policy and Outsourcing Policy approved by the Board, along with the operational manuals and procedures issued from time to time; system of internal controls; Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan for I.T.; and regular audit of the branches and divisions. Operational risk related matters are discussed in the operations committee, compliance committee of management and I.T. steering committee. Audit Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group’s operational risk.

The Group’s operational risk management framework, as laid down in the operational risk policy, permits the overall risk management approach to evolve in the light of organisational learning and the future needs of the Group.


The Group places a high priority on conducting all business dealings with integrity and fairness, as laid down in the Code of Conduct, which is required to be complied with by all employees.

Internal controls are an essential feature of risk reduction in operational risk management and the Group continues to improve its internal controls.

Business Continuity Plan of the Group pays special attention to identification of potential threats and associated risks in critical business processes by carrying out Business Impact Analysis and Risk Assessment including those which are dependent on external vendors or third parties, identification of alternative mechanisms for timely resumption of services, with special focus on critical business processes, location of off-site backup & regular review and testing of the plan.

Bank AL Habib’s internet banking platform, both web and mobile based applications are successfully implemented and regularly enhanced to provide better customer experience.

The Group has zero tolerance for Cybersecurity risks and non-compliance to regulations. Monitoring controls and processes have been implemented to identify and appropriately address Cybersecurity risks. Long term measures are defined in Cyber Security Strategy that is supported by a complementing Action Plan. While Information Security Risk Management plan covers measures for identifying the risks posed to Information Systems in alignment with Group’s strategy. I.T. Security has developed a cyber secure environment by implementing various technical and administrative controls to ensure security of customers’ data residing with the Group. In this regard, Group is also in process of implementing industrial standards and best practices for Information Security assurance.

# 45.3.1 Operational Risk-Disclosures Basel II Specific

The Group uses Basic Indicator Approach to calculate capital charge for operational risk as per Basel regulatory framework. This approach is considered to be most suitable in view of the business model of the Group which relies on an extensive network of branches to offer one-stop, full-service banking to its clients. The Group has developed and implemented an Operational Loss Database. Operational loss and "near miss" events are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions taken on an ongoing basis, including measures to improve security and control procedures. Key Risk Indicators have also been developed along with thresholds which are being closely monitored for breaches. Risk Evaluation exercise is carried out for new products, processes and systems or any significant change in the existing product, processes and systems as per the operational risk policy of the Group.

# 45.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss to the Group arising from its inability to meet obligations as they fall due or to fund growth in assets, without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Key elements of the Group’s liquidity risk management are as follows:

- To maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet the Group’s funding requirements at any time.
- To keep a strong focus on mobilization of low-cost core deposits from customers.
- To maintain a realistic balance between the behavioral maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.
- To maintain excellent credit rating (as borrowing cost and ability to raise funds are directly affected by credit rating).
- To have a written contingency funding plan to address any hypothetical situations when access to normal sources of funding is constrained.

# 45.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio

SBP issued BPRD Circular No. 08 dated June 23, 2016 advising implementation of Basel III liquidity standards that constitute two ratios, i.e., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and five monitoring tools.

LCR is the measure of conversion capability of the Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) into cash to meet immediate liquidity requirements over a 30 days horizon.




# 45.4 Liquidity Risk Management

# 45.4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

The Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on monthly basis as per the guidelines given in the above mentioned circular. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile which requires the Bank to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-days period. As of 31 December 2022, the Bank’s LCR stood at 252% against the SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.

# 45.4.2 Governance of Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is managed through the liquidity risk policy approved by the Board. The Group has “zero tolerance” for liquidity risk and will continue to maintain a comfortable margin of excess liquidity in the form of cash and readily marketable assets to meet its funding requirements at any time. Management of liquidity risk is accomplished through a formal structure which includes:

- Board of Directors (BOD)
- Risk Management Committee
- Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
- Treasury Division
- Risk Management Division and Middle Office
- Finance Division
- Information Technology Division

The Board of Directors approves the liquidity risk policy and ensures, through quarterly reviews by the Risk Management Committee of the Board, that the Group’s liquidity risk is being managed prudently. Risk Management Committee of the Board provides overall guidance in managing the Group’s liquidity risk. Liquidity position is monitored daily by the Treasury Division and the Middle Office and reviewed regularly by ALCO.

# 45.4.3 Funding Strategy

The Group’s prime source of liquidity is the customers' deposit base. Within deposits, the Group strives to maintain core deposit base in form of current and saving deposits and avoids concentration in particular products, tenors and dependence on large fund providers. As a general rule, the Group will not depend on borrowings in the inter-bank market, including repos, to be a part of its permanent pool of funds for financing of loans, but will use these as a source for obtaining moderate amounts of additional funds to meet temporary liquidity needs in the normal course of business or for money market operations.

# 45.4.4 Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like core deposits to total deposits, advances to deposits, liquid assets to total deposits, Interbank borrowing to total deposits, which are monitored on regular basis against limits. Further, the Group also prepares the maturity profile of assets and liabilities to monitor the liquidity gaps over different time bands. For maturity analysis, behavioral study is carried out to determine the behavior of non-contractual assets and liabilities. The Group also ensures that statutory cash and liquidity requirements are maintained at all times.

In addition, LCR, NSFR and Monitoring Tools of Basel III framework further strengthen liquidity risk management of the Group.

# 45.4.5 Liquidity Stress Testing

As per SBP FSD Circular No. 01 of 2020, Liquidity stress testing is being conducted under various stress scenarios. Shocks include the withdrawals of deposits, withdrawals of wholesale / large deposits & interbank borrowing, withdrawal of top deposits, etc. Results of stress testing are presented to ALCO and Risk Management Committee. The Group’s liquidity risk management addresses the goal of protecting solvency and the ability to withstand stressful events in the market place. Stress testing for liquidity as prescribed in the liquidity risk policy is carried out regularly to estimate the impact of decline in liquidity on the ratio of liquid assets to deposits plus borrowings.



# 45.4.6 Contingency Funding Plan

Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity risk policy of the Group which identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity contingency and describes the actions to be taken to manage it. The contingency funding plan highlights liquidity management actions that needs to be taken to deal with the contingency. Responsibilities and response levels are also incorporated in order to tackle the contingency. Moreover, CFP highlights possible funding sources, in case of a liquidity contingency.

# 45.4.7 Main Components of LCR

Main components of LCR are High Quality Liquid Assets and Net Cash Outflows. Outflows are mainly deposit outflows net of cash inflows which consist of inflows from financing and money market placements up to 1 month. The inputs for calculation of LCR are based on SBP BPRD Circular No. 08 dated 23 June 2016.

# 45.4.8 Composition of HQLAs

High Quality Liquid Assets consist of Level 1 Assets which are included in the stock of liquid assets at 100% weightage of their market value i.e., Cash & Treasury balances, Conventional Government Securities, GOP Ijarah Sukuks, Foreign Currency Sukuks & Bonds issued by sovereigns. While Level 2 Assets comprise all equity shares (excluding shares of Financial Institutions) listed on PSX 100.

# 45.4.9 Concentration of Funding Sources

The Group relies on customers' deposits as its key source of funding, especially current and saving deposits and time deposits of small / medium denominations, and avoids concentration of large deposits. Share of core deposits in total deposits and of large deposits in total deposits are regularly monitored. In particular the Group does not depend on large depositors or borrowings from SBP and financial institutions to meet its funding requirements.

# 45.4.10 Currency Mismatch in the LCR

About 90% of the Group's assets and liabilities are in local currency. Currency mismatch in other currencies is regularly monitored.

# 45.4.11 Centralisation of Liquidity Management

Overall liquidity management of the Group is centralised in Treasury Division at Principal Office. The Group mobilises deposits through its branch network. It also uses the branch network to grant loans to customers. Branches that have more deposits than loans, transfer (“lend”) their excess deposits to the Principal Office. Branches that do not have enough deposits to fund their loans, acquire (“borrow”) additional funds from the Principal Office.

# 45.4.12 Other Inflows & Outflows

Benefit of pledged deposits (deposits under lien) are not accounted for in calculation of LCR.

# 45.4.13 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

NSFR is the ratio of the amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) - source of funds, capital and liabilities relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF) - use of funds, assets and off - balance sheet exposures. The objective of NSFR is to ensure the availability of stable funds that a Group must hold to enable it to build and maintain its assets, investments and off balance sheet portfolio on an ongoing basis for longer term, i.e., over a one year horizon. NSFR reduces maturity mismatches between the asset and liability items on the balance sheet and thereby reduces funding and roll - over risk. The Bank’s NSFR stood at 179% as on 31 December 2022.


# 45.5 Maturities of Assets and Liabilities

based on contractual maturity of the assets and liabilities of the Group

The following maturity profile is based on contractual maturities for assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised in the shortest maturity band.

# 45.6 Maturities of assets and liabilities - based on expected maturities of the assets and liabilities of the Group

For assets and liabilities that have a contractual maturity, the expected maturity is considered to be the same as contractual maturity. Assets and Liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity have been categorised on the basis of expected maturities as determined by ALCO. In case of saving and current accounts, their historical net withdrawal pattern over the next one year was reviewed, based on year-end balances for the last three years. Thereafter, taking a conservative view, ALCO categorised these deposits in various maturity bands. Other assets and liabilities have been categorised on the basis of assumptions / judgments that are believed to be reasonable.

- Period, return, safety, security and liquidity of investment.
- Maturities of funds obtained from Principal Office, Islamic Banking Institutions and Shariah compliant organizations as regulated in Pakistan.
- Element of risk attached to various types of investments.
- SBP rules & Shariah clearance.

# 9.2 Avenues / sectors of economy / business where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed

The Mudarba based funds have been deployed in the following avenues / sectors / business:

- Chemical and pharmaceuticals
- Agribusiness
- Textile
- Sugar
- Shoes and leather garments
- Investment in sukuk, shares and mutual funds
- Production and transmission of energy
- Food and allied except sugar
- Cement

# 9.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool at every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income / loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 50% (2021: 50%) of Net Income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 50% (2021: 50%) of Net Income. After the allocation of Income between the equity holder and depositors the profit is distributed among the account holders on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# Complaint Handling

Under the umbrella of Customer Service Division, Complaint Management is primarily in control of upholding high FTC (Fair Treatment to Customers) standards by promptly resolving complaints and providing fair resolutions to customers.

To promote customers centricity in the culture and dynamics of BAHL, we have developed a comprehensive policy for handling customer complaints that is established on the values of fairness, transparency, promptness, visibility, and accessibility. BAHL takes complaints as an effective measure to improve its services instead of considering complaints as root cause for customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, Fair Treatment to Consumers Committee (FTCC) is established to anticipate customer problems and recommend resolution that can give our customers a better experience.

In order to ensure that customer concerns are quickly resolved, Bank’s customer complaint unit has been enhanced further during 2022. Additionally, training sessions have been conducted to emphasize complaint management procedures and guidelines throughout the bank.

Customers can register complaints through a variety of channels, including a call center, the bank’s website, direct emails, social media, and letters delivered directly or through drop box to the customer services division. These complaints are swiftly recorded in the complaint management system. From the time a complaint is acknowledged until it is resolved, the bank has a defined escalation matrix to resolve complaints, where if any complaint is not resolved within the allotted turnaround time, it is escalated to the next senior level of management to ensure resolution of the complaints on priority.

As a post resolution activity, the complaint trends and analysis are shared with Board Members, Senior Management and Business Segments. Based on the findings, root cause analysis is conducted and communicated timely with the relevant departments for reduction of customer grievance.

# Key Highlight

In 2022, the Bank received 383,488 complaints about 77% higher than the previous year. The complaints were investigated and closed within an average turnaround time of 4 working days.
