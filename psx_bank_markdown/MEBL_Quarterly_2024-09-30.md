# DIRECTORS' REVIEW 

The Board of Directors is pleased to present the condensed interim unaudited unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements of Meezan Bank Limited for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

## Economy

Pakistan's economy is on the path to recovery as positive trends continue to emerge in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2024-2025, driven by prudent policies and strategic initiatives implemented by the Federal Government, which have started to restore market confidence and stimulate economic activity. Key initiatives such as fiscal consolidation, broadening the tax base and efforts to address circular debt issue in the power sector would further strengthen the public finances. GDP growth accelerated to $2.4 \%$ in FY 2024, supported by increased industrial output, reduced inflationary pressures and an improved current account balance. Given the improved economic fundamentals, this positive trajectory is expected to continue in FY 2025.

Year-on-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has receded significantly, reaching single digits after peaking at 38\% in May 2023. As of September 2024, inflation stands at 6.9\%, the lowest in thirty-four months. This easing of inflation has prompted the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, reducing the policy rate by a cumulative 450 basis points to $17.50 \%$ by the end of September 2024, down from $22.00 \%$ in September 2023. This downward trend in Policy Rate is expected to continue, given the improved inflationary outlook. The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has also shown remarkable performance, rising by $30 \%$ since the end of 2023. The PSX-100 Index closed at 81,114 points in September 2024, up from 62,451 points in December 2023, positioning it among the best-performing indices globally. This upward momentum is attributed to political stability, improved economic fundamentals and favourable market sentiment.

On the external front, Pakistan's total foreign exchange reserves increased to $\$ 16$ billion in September 2024, up from $\$ 12$ billion in September 2023 supported by receipt of the first loan tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), robust remittances from overseas Pakistanis and improved export proceeds. The Government has successfully managed the trade deficit through increased exports and rationalization of imports. Worker remittances remain a critical source of foreign exchange, with positive trends emerging following the administrative reforms that have narrowed the exchange rate disparity between the interbank and open markets. Record high remittances of USD 8.8 billion were received in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025. The above factors have resulted in a significant reduction in the current account deficit. The IMF's 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement of approximately $\$ 7$ billion will further support macroeconomic stability and encourage efficient policies and reforms to address structural challenges and foster inclusive and resilient growth. These measures have resulted in stabilization of the PKR/USD exchange rate with the PKR strengthening to PKR 277.7 per US Dollar by the end of September 2024, compared to PKR 281.9 per US Dollar at the end of December 2023.

To ensure sustainable growth, continued fiscal consolidation in FY 2025 and beyond is essential. Overall, the nation's economy is beginning to stabilize, buoyed by the promising outlook of the new IMF programme, which is anticipated to drive further macroeconomic improvements in the long term.

## Financial Highlights

Alhamdulillah, we are pleased to report that Meezan Bank has delivered strong results for the nine months ending September 2024, with a 34\% increase in Profit after Tax, rising to Rs 77.5 billion from Rs 58 billion in the corresponding period last year. This translates into Basic Earnings per Share of Rs 43.26 by September 2024, compared to Rs 32.42 in the same period last year. The Bank's Return on Average Equity (ROAE) clocked at 50\%, highlighting our remarkable financial performance, while Return on Average Assets (ROAA) surpassed 3\%. Our strategy of balanced dividend pay-outs and profit retention has resulted in strong internal capital generation, reflected in a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) in excess of 20\%.



<!-- Page 7 -->

We are pleased to announce that the Board has approved an interim cash dividend of Rs 7.00 (70\%) for the third quarter of 2024. This decision brings the total dividend payout for the nine-month period to Rs 21.00 (210\%), which includes the Rs 14.00 per share (140\%) interim cash dividend distributed in the first half of 2024. Our unwavering commitment to our shareholders is reflected in our long-standing tradition of consistently paying dividends every year since the Bank's listing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Meezan continues to maintain its status as the most valuable bank in Pakistan, with a market capitalization of Rs 409 billion ( $\$ 1.5$ billion), underscoring investor confidence in the Bank's board and management, performance and growth prospects. Below are the financial highlights of Meezan Bank:

Rupees in millions

|  Statement of Financial Position | September 30,
$\mathbf{2 0 2 4}$ | December 31,
$\mathbf{2 0 2 3}$ | Growth \%  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Total Assets | $3,379,808$ | $3,012,109$ | $12 \%$  |
|  Investments | $1,741,989$ | $1,572,388$ | $11 \%$  |

|  ADR (Gross Advances to Deposits)- \% | $43.8 \%$ | $44.7 \%$ | $(1 \%)$  |
|  Equity | 230,731 | 184,908 | $25 \%$  |

The return from financing, investments and placements increased by $24 \%$, to Rs 378 billion compared to Rs 304 billion in September 2023, driven by a higher average SBP policy rate and an expanded average volume of earning assets. Over the nine months period, the SBP policy rate averaged $21.04 \%$, up from $20.25 \%$ in September 2023. Returns on deposits and other expenses also rose from Rs 149.2 billion in September 2023 to Rs 163.1 billion marking a 9\% increase year-over-year. Overall, our net spread improved by $39 \%$ to Rs 215 billion, up from Rs 155 billion in the corresponding period last year.

Fee and commission income depicted a robust growth of $24 \%$, rising to Rs 15.4 billion by the end of the nine-month period from Rs 12.4 billion in September 2023, largely driven by contributions from Debit Card services, branch banking and trade-related income. During this period, our Debit Card portfolio expanded by around 500,000 cards, bringing the total to more than 3.7 million. Debit Card spending increased by $31 \%$, with Near Field Communication (NFC) transactions



<!-- Page 8 -->

surging by $156 \%$. Domestic spending on Debit Cards also rose significantly to Rs 178 billion for the nine months ending September 2024, compared to Rs 124 billion in the same period last year, reflecting a substantial increase of $42 \%$. On the remittances front, Meezan Easy Remit is making significant strides in enhancing its global network, ensuring efficient cross-border transactions for our valued customers. During this period, our remittances income witnessed a jump of $68 \%$ compared to the same period last year, contributed by increase in remittance volumes. Dividend income nearly doubled to Rs 1.1 billion from Rs 588 million in September 2023, primarily driven by healthy distribution from investment in shares and mutual funds.

Operating expenses increased by $31 \%$, rising from Rs 50.8 billion in September 2023 to Rs 66.5 billion in the current nine-month period. This increase is primarily due to sustained inflationary pressures throughout the period along with strategic investments in IT projects and the costs associated with expanding our branch network-reflecting our commitment to future growth. Despite these higher expenses, the Bank was able to maintain its cost to income ratio below 30\%. The Bank remains dedicated to pursuing further cost rationalization and process automation strategies.

Total assets reached Rs 3.38 trillion, representing a 12\% increase from Rs 3.01 trillion in December 2023. The liquidity generated through incremental deposits was effectively channelled in building the financings and investments portfolio which registered growth of $13 \%$ and $11 \%$ respectively. The investments portfolio rose to Rs 1.74 trillion from Rs 1.57 trillion at the end of 2023. This growth is largely due to ongoing Sukuk auctions conducted by the Government of Pakistan, which have helped address traditional liquidity management challenges within the Islamic Banking Industry (IBI).

The gross financing portfolio reached Rs 1.12 trillion from Rs 992 billion in December 2023, translating in Gross Advances-to-Deposits Ratio (ADR) of 44\%. With the Gross ADR tax in place again, which was previously exempted for the banking sector for the financial year 2023, the Bank will strive to achieve a Gross ADR in excess of $50 \%$ while prioritizing asset quality preservation and adhering to all risk acceptance parameters. While growth is a priority, the objective remains to maintain a high-quality asset portfolio. As of September end, Meezan has one of the industry's lowest non-performing financing ratios at 1.7\%. The Bank maintains a robust level of provisions against its non-performing financing portfolio, resulting in a coverage ratio of 179\% as of September 2024.

The Bank's deposits portfolio grew by 15\%, reaching Rs 2.56 trillion compared to Rs 2.22 trillion at year-end 2023. The Current Account (CA) deposit portfolio grew to Rs 1.2 trillion representing $47 \%$ of total deposits, while the Savings Account (SA) portfolio saw a significant increase of 26\%, rising by Rs 231 billion to cross Rs 1 trillion. Together, Current and Savings Account (CASA) deposits amounted to Rs 2.32 trillion, representing $90 \%$ of the Bank's total deposit portfolio. During the nine-month period, Meezan Bank expanded its client base by adding approximately 757,000 new-to-bank customers, enhancing our deposit relationship portfolio. Meezan Bank's Roshan Digital Account continues to experience remarkable growth, maintaining its leadership position in the industry with total inflows of USD 2.3 billion, representing 26\% of total industry inflows during the nine-month period ended September 2024. Currently, over 115,000 Meezan RDA accounts are operational, providing seamless banking services to members of the Pakistani diaspora residing in more than 144 countries worldwide.

In line with our hybrid growth model, we are expanding our physical presence while enhancing our digital customer onboarding processes. As of the end of the current nine-month period, our strategically located branch network consists of 1,015 branches across 339 cities, supported by an extensive ATM network with over 1,200 touchpoints nationwide. Our ATMs are biometric-enabled and offer Tap and Withdraw services, enabling customers to access ATM functions with a simple tap of their NFC-enabled debit cards. Additionally, our Merchant Acquiring Business includes over 24,000 POS terminals and partnerships with more than 800 e-commerce merchants across 326 cities. Notably, nearly $45 \%$ of our Card Acquiring Business comes from SME vendors, highlighting our commitment to financial inclusion. Our state-of-the-art Mobile Banking App offers a seamless and secure platform for customers to conduct digital transactions

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW 

efficiently. Meezan Bank's leadership in digital transactions among retail customers is further confirmed by 1-Link's Monthly Ranking Reports, which consistently rank us as the top bank for overall digital transactions processed through 1-Link's grid.

The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed Meezan Bank with the highest possible credit rating of 'AAA' (Triple A) for the Long Term and 'A1+' (A-One Plus) for the Short Term, maintaining a stable outlook.

## Outlook

Meezan Bank remains committed to supporting the economic growth and stability of our nation through the development of the Islamic Banking Industry. Our strategy prioritizes balanced growth, sector diversification and exceeding regulatory stability benchmarks. We are expanding our presence through both physical and digital channels, with a strong focus on delivering exceptional digital services to maintain our industry leadership. In view of the recent reduction in policy rate by Monetary Policy Committee of the SBP, there will be a pressure on the margins of the banking industry going forward. The Bank will endeavour to mitigate this impact through growth in core CASA deposits and improving its non-fund based revenue.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment to establishing a sustainable Islamic financial system in the country. Our significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the proactive support of our diverse customer base, to whom we are deeply indebted. We also express our gratitude to the Board of Directors, members of the Shariah Board, our shareholders and holders of Additional Tier I and Subordinated Tier II Sukuks for their continuous patronage for establishing Meezan Bank as the leading Islamic Bank in the country.

We would like to convey our appreciation to every member of our devoted team for their diligent efforts and steadfast dedication to furthering the mission of Islamic Banking. Above all, we humbly acknowledge and offer gratitude to Allah Almighty for His continuous blessings upon our Bank and each one of us, which have made possible our notable achievements within a relatively brief timeframe. We beseech Him for His continued support, granting us the fortitude and insight to continue advancing our Vision of "establishing Islamic banking as banking of first choice".

ڈائریکٹرز کا تجربہ

# انجنڈریلوزت الفلمین

بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹر زمیزان پیک لمونڈ کے 30 ستمبر 2024 کو ختم ہونے والی سہ ماہی اور نو مینیوں کے مختصر عبوری غیر جانچ شدہ مالیاتی حسابات اور انصافی مالیاتی حسابات پیش کرتے ہیں۔

## معیشت

ماہی سال 2024-2025 کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں مثبت رنٹانات اچا گر ہونے کے باعث پاکستان کی معیشت بحالی کی راہ پر گامزن ہے، جو کہ وفاق حکومت کی جانب سے نافذ کردہ دانشمندانہ پالیسیوں اور اسٹرسٹنگ اقدامات کا نتیجہ ہیں جنہوں نے مارکیٹ کا اعتماد بحال کرنا اور معاشی سرگرمیوں کو تنکرک کرنا شروع کر دیا ہے۔ اہم اقدامات جیسے کہ مالیاتی استحکام، نیکس کی بنیاد کو وسیع کرنا اور پاورکینٹر میں گردشی قرضوں کے سینک کوحل کرنے کی کوششوں سے عوامی مالیات کو مزید تقویت ملے گی۔ ماہی سال 2024 میں مجموعی داخلی پیداوار کی شرح نمبر 24 فیصد تک پہنچ گئی جس کی مدد سے صفتی پیداوار میں اضافہ، افراط زر کے دباؤ میں کمی اور کرنٹ اکاؤنٹ نیشن میں بہتری آئی۔ بہتر معاشی بنیادی اصولوں کے پیش نظر، یہ مثبت رفتار ماہی سال 2025 میں جاری رہنے کی امید ہے۔

سال بہ سال کٹر نیومر پر انس انڈیکس (CPI) افراط زر میں نمایاں کمی آئی ہے جو کہ می 2023 میں %38 کی اونچی سطح پر جانے کے بعد اکائی کے ہندسوں تک پہنچ گئی ہے۔ عنبر 2024 میں افراط زر %6.9 پر ہے جو چوتیس مینیوں میں سب سے مرشح پر ہے۔ مہنگائی میں اس کمی نے احیث پیک آف پاکستان (SBP) کو مزید موافق مانیٹری پالیسی کا موقف اپنانے پر آمادہ کیا، جس سے عنبر 2024 کے آخر تک پالیسی ریٹ کو مجموعی طور پر 450 یسر بچائنیں سے کم کر کے %17.50 کر دیا گیا، جو کہ عنبر 2023 میں %22.00 سے کم ہو گیا ہے۔ افراط زر میں بہتری کے پیش نظر پالیسی کی شرح میں کمی کا یہ رنٹان جاری رہنے کی توقع ہے۔ پاکستان اسٹاک ایڈجسٹج (PSX) نے بھی شاندار کارکردگی دکھائی ہے، جس میں 2023 کے اختتام سے اب تک 30 فیصد اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ PSX-100 انڈیکس عنبر 2024 میں 81,114 پالتنیں پر بند ہوا، جو دمبر 2023 میں 62,451 پالتنیں سے بڑھ کر اس کی عالمی سطح پر بہترین کارکردگی کی جانب اشارہ کرتا ہے۔ اس ترقی کی رفتار کی وجہ سہا سی استحکام، بہتر معاشی بنیادیں اور سازگار مارکیٹ کے حالات ہیں۔

بیروٹی محاذ پر، پاکستان کے زر مبادلہ کے کل ذخائر عنبر 2024 میں بڑھ کر 16 ملین امریکی ڈالر ہو گئے، جو کہ عنبر 2023 میں 12 ملین امریکی ڈالر تھے اور جسے بین الاقوامی مالیاتی فنڈ (آئی ایم اایف) سے قرض کی پہلی قد لکی وصولی، سندھ پاور پاکستانوں کی جانب سے تر机ات زر میں زبردست اضافے اور برآمدات میں بہتری کی وجہ سے معاون حاصل ہوئی۔ حکومت نے برآمدات میں اضافہ اور درآمدات کی معقولیت کے ذریعے تنہائی شمارے کو کامیابی سے کم کیا ہے۔ ورکرز کی تر机ات زر غیر ملکی زر مبادلہ کا ایک اہم ذریعہ بنی ہوئی ہیں، جو کہ انتظامی اصلاحات کے نتیجے میں مثبت رنٹانات ابھر رہے ہیں جنہوں نے انٹر پیک اور اوپن مارکیٹوں کے درمیان شرح مبادلہ کے فرق کو کم کر دیا ہے۔ ماہی سال 2025 کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں 8.8 ملین امریکی ڈالر کی ریکارڈ بلند تر机ات زر موصول ہوئیں۔ مندرجہ بالا عوامل کے نتیجے میں کرنٹ اکاؤنٹ شمارے میں نمایاں کمی واقع ہوئی ہے۔ آئی ایم اایف کا تقریباً 7 ملین امریکی ڈالر کا 37 ماہ کی اکثخیٹڈ ڈلٹر گمنٹائی (EFF) کی وجہ سے نیکرو آئٹاک استحکام کو مزید معاونت ملے گی اور یہ سائن کینٹیوں سے نمٹنے اور جامع اور لیکدار غو کے فروغ کے لیے موثر پالیسیوں اور اصلاحات کی حوصلہ افزائی کرے گا۔ ان اقدامات کے نتیجے میں دمبر 2023 کے آخر میں پاکستان روپے 281.9 فی امریکی ڈالر کے مقابلے میں عنبر 2024 کے آخر تک پاکستان روپے 277.7 روپے فی امریکی ڈالر پر مختصر ہونے کے ساتھ روپے امریکی ڈالر کی شرح تبادلہ میں استحکام آیا ہے۔

پائیدار ترقی کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے، ماہی سال 2025 اور اس کے بعد جاری ماہی استحکام ضروری ہے۔ نئے آئی ایم اایف پروگرام کے امید افزا انتظامی نظر کے باعث مجموعی طور پر ملک کی معیشت مختصر ہونا شروع ہورہی ہے، جس سے مستقبل میں مزید معاشی بہتری کی توقع ہے۔

## مالیاتی نکات

اقدامند ہمیں یہ اطلاع دینے ہوئے خوشی ہورہی ہے کہ میزان پیک نے عنبر 2024 کو ختم ہونے والے نو مینیوں کے لیے مختصر نتائج پیش کیے ہیں، جس میں نیکس کے بعد منافع میں 34 فیصد اضافہ ہوا ہے، جو پچھلے سال کی اسی مدت میں 58 ارب روپے سے بڑھ کر 77.5 ملین روپے ہو گیا ہے۔ یہ عنبر 2024 تک 43.26 روپے فی شیمز کی بنیادی آمدنی کی ترجمانی کرتا ہے، جو پچھلے سال کی اسی مدت میں 32.42 روپے تھی۔ پیک کا اوسط ایکو پٹی پر منافع (ROAE) %50 تک پہنچ

آپ بینک اخراجات میں 31 فیصد اضافہ ہوا، جو تنمیر 2023 میں 50.8 فین روپے سے بڑھ کر موجودہ نو ماہ کی مدت میں 66.5 فین روپے تک پہنچ گیا۔ یہ اضافہ بنیادی طور پر آئی ٹی پر وائیکس میں اسٹرسنگ سرمایہ کاری اور ہمارے براچ لیٹ ورک کو وسعت دینے سے وابستہ اخراجات کے ساتھ پوری مدت میں مرحلانی کے مسلسل دباؤ کی وجہ سے ہوا ہے، جو کہ مستقبل کی ترقی کے لیے ہمارے عزم کی حکامی کرتا ہے۔ ان اضافی اخراجات کے باوجود، ویک اینی لاگت سے آمدنی کا تناسب %30 سے نیچے برقرار رکھنے میں کامیاب رہا۔ ویک لاگت کو مزید متفوق بنانے اور خود کا طریقے سے قبل کرنے کی حکمت عملیوں کو آگے بڑھانے کے لئے کوٹنال ہے۔

کل بجائے 3.38 کمرہ روپے تک پہنچ گئے، جو ڈمبر 2023 میں 3.01 کمرہ روپے سے 12 فیصد اضافے کو ظاہر کرتا ہے۔ اضافی ڈھانز کے ذریعے پیدا ہونے والی لیکو پڈیٹی کو فٹائنگ اور سرمایہ کاری کے پورٹ فولیو کی تعمیر میں مؤثر طریقے سے استعمال کیا گیا جس سے بالترتیب %13 اور %11 کی شرح نمو ریکارڈ کی گئی۔ سرمایہ کاری کا پورٹ فولیو 2023 کے آخر میں 1.57 کمرہ روپے سے بڑھ کر 1.74 کمرہ روپے تک پہنچ گیا۔ یہ نمو بڑی حد تک حکومت پاکستان کی جانب سے جاری سکوک نیلا میوں کی وجہ سے ہے، جس نے اسلامی جیکنگ انڈسٹری (IBI) میں لیکو پڈیٹی چیجنٹ کے روایتی چیلنجوں سے نمٹنے میں مدد فراہم کی ہے۔

مجموعی فٹائنگ پورٹ فولیو ڈمبر 2023 میں 992 ارب روپے سے بڑھ کر 1.12 کمرہ روپے تک پہنچ گیا، جو کہ 44 فیصد کے مجموعی ایڈ و انسٹ نو ڈپازنس ریشیو (ADR) کو ظاہر کرتا ہے۔ کروں اے ڈی آرکنس دوبارہ لاگو ہونے کے ساتھ، جسے پہلے مالی سال 2023 کے لیے جیکنگ بیکلر کے لیے لائنٹی دیا گیا تھا، ویک اخناؤں کے معیار کے تحفظ کو ترجیح دینے ہوئے اور تمام خطرے کی قبولیت کے پیرامینرز پر عمل کرتے ہوئے %50 سے زیادہ مجموعی ADR حاصل کرنے کی کوشش کرے گا۔ اگر یہ ترقی ایک ترجیح ہے، تاہم بنیادی مقصد ایک اعلیٰ معیار کے اخلاجات کے پورٹ فولیو کو برقرار رکھنا ہے۔ تنمیر کے آخر تک میزبان کاٹن پر فارمنگ فٹائنگ ریشیو انڈسٹری میں سب سے کم میں سے ایک ہے جو کہ %1.7 ہے۔ ویک اپنے ٹان پر فارمنگ فٹائنگ پورٹ فولیو کے بدلے پر وہ بیڈلز کی ایک مضبوط سطح کو برقرار رکھتا ہے، جس کے نتیجے میں تنمیر 2024 تک کو ترجیح ریشیو %179 ہے۔

ویک کے ڈپازنس پورٹ فولیو میں 15 فیصد اضافہ ہوا، جو کہ سال 2023 کے آخر میں 2.22 کمرہ روپے کے مقابلے میں 2.56 کمرہ روپے تک پہنچ گیا۔ کرنٹ اکاؤنٹ (CA) ڈپازٹ پورٹ فولیو بڑھ کر 1.2 کمرہ روپے ہو گیا جوگل ڈپازنس کا 47 فیصد ہے، جبکہ سیوگنز اکاؤنٹ (SA) پورٹ فولیو میں 26 فیصد کا نمایاں اضافہ دیکھا گیا، جو 231 ارب روپے کے اضافے سے 1 کمرہ روپے سے تجاوز کر گیا۔ کرنٹ اور سیونگ اکاؤنٹ (CASA) کے ڈپازنس مجموعی طور پر 2.32 کمرہ روپے بنتے ہیں جو کہ ویک کے گل ڈپازٹ پورٹ فولیو کا %90 ہے۔ نو ماہ کی مدت کے دوران میزبان ویک نے تقریباً 757,000 سے ویک صارفین کو شامل کر کے ڈپازٹ ریلیشن شپ پورٹ فولیو کو بڑھایا۔ میزبان ویک کا روشن ڈسچیلل اکاؤنٹ مسلسل قابل ذکر ترقی کا مظاہرہ کر رہا ہے، جس نے 2.3 ارب امریکی ڈائریکگل آمدنی کے ساتھ انڈسٹری میں اپنی اول پوزیشن کو برقرار رکھا ہے، جو تنمیر 2024 کو ختم ہونے والی نو ماہ کی مدت کے دوران انڈسٹری کی گل آمدن کا 26 فیصد ہے۔ فی الحال 115,000 سے زیادہ میزبان روشن ڈسچیلل اکاؤنٹس ہیں، جو کہ دنیا بھر کے 144 سے زائد ممالک میں مقیم پاکستان تارکین وفن کو علیحمی رکاوٹ کے جیکنگ خدمات فراہم کر رہے ہیں۔

ہمارے ہائبرڈ گروتھ ماؤل کے مطابق ہم اپنے ڈھیلنڈ سکٹر آئن بورڈنگ کے عمل کو بڑھاتے ہوئے اپنی فیزیکل موجودگی کو بڑھارہے ہیں۔ موجودہ ٹو ماو کی مدت کے اختتام تک ہمارا اسٹرسٹنگ طور پر واقع برائیج لیت ورک 339 شہروں میں 1,015 برائیوں پر مشتمل ہے، جس کو ملک بھر میں 1,200 سے زیادہ نیچے پوانٹن کے ساتھ ایک وسیع ATM لیت ورک کی مدد حاصل ہے۔ ہمارے احداث ایمز بائیوٹینٹرک فعال ہیں اور لیپ اینڈ ودڈرا کی خدمات پیش کرتے ہیں، جس سے صارفین اپنے این ایف بی فعال ڈریٹ کارڈز کے ایک سادہ لیپ کے ساتھ احداث ایم کٹلائن تک رسائی حاصل کرسکتے ہیں۔ مزید برآں، ہمارے مرینت ایکوائزنگ بزنس میں 24,000 سے زیادہ POS ڈومینٹر اور 326 شہروں میں 800 سے زیادہ ای کامرس مرینتس کے ساتھ شراکت داری شامل ہے۔ خاص طور پر ہمارے کارڈ حاصل کرنے والے کاروبار کا تقریباً 45% ایسا ایم ای وینڈرز سے آتا ہے، جو مالی شمولیت کے لیے ہماری واٹنگی کو ظاہر کرتا ہے۔ ہماری جدید ترین موبائل ہیڈنگ ایپ صارفین کو مؤثر طریقے سے ڈھیلنڈ لین دین کرنے کے لیے ایک ہموار اور محفوظ پلیٹ فارم پیش کرتی ہے۔ رینیل صارفین کے درمیان ڈھیلنڈ لین دین میں میزبان ہیڈ کی قیادت کی مزید تصدیق 1-Link کی ماہانہ ریٹنگ ریورٹس سے ہوتی ہے، جو ہمیں 1-Link کے گرو کے ذریعے پروسس ہونے والی مجموعی ڈھیلنڈ لین دین کے لیے مسلسل سرفہرست ہیڈ کے طور پر درجہ دیتی ہے۔

VIS کریڈٹ ریٹنگ کمپنی لولیٹڈ نے مستحکم آلات تک کو برقرار رکھتے ہوئے میزبان ہیڈ کو طویل مدت کے لیے 'AAA' (ٹرپل A) اور مختصر مدت کے لیے +A-One Plus) A1) کی اعلی ترین تکدکریڈٹ ریٹنگ کے ساتھ دوبارہ تصدیق کی ہے۔

**لطفہ نظر**

میزبان ہیڈ اسلای ہیڈنگ انڈسٹری کی ترقی کے ذریعے ہمارے ملک کی اقتصادی ترقی اور استحکام میں معاونت کے لیے پرعزم ہے۔ ہماری حکمت عملی متوازن نمو، شعبے میں تنوع اور ضابطوں کے استحکام کے معیارات سے تجاوز کو ترجیح دیتی ہے۔ ہم اپنی انڈسٹری کی لیڈر بیپ کو برقرار رکھنے کے لیے غیر معمولی ڈھیلنڈ خدمات کی فراہمی پر بھر پور توجہ کے ساتھ، فیزیکل اور ڈھیلنڈ دونوں چینلز کے ذریعے اپنی موجودگی کو بڑھارہے ہیں۔ اسٹیٹ ہیڈ کی ماٹیٹری پالیسی کمپنی کی جانب سے پالیسی ریٹ میں حالیہ کمی کے پیش نظر، بڑھتے ہوئے ہیڈنگ انڈسٹری کے مارٹن پر آئندہ دباؤ پڑے گا۔ ہیڈ CASA کے بنیادی ڈنڈز میں اضافے اور اپنی غیر فنڈ پر مبنی آمدنی کو بہتر بنا کر اس اثر کو کم کرنے کی کوشش کرے گا۔

ہم اسٹیٹ ہیڈ آف پاکستان، وزارت خزانہ اور سیکہر لینڈ اینڈ اسپیچیج کیمکن آف پاکستان کو ملک میں ایک پانچہ ارا سلای مالیاتی نظام کے قیام کے لیے ان کے غیر متبلزل عزم کے لیے تیدرل سے خراج تحسین پیش کرتے ہیں۔ ہماری اہم کامیابیاں ہمارے منکوع صارفین کے فعال تعاون کے بغیر ممکن نہیں ہوئیں، جن کے ہم دل کی گہرائیوں سے متفروض ہیں۔ ہم بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹرز، شریف بورڈ کے ممبران، اپنے شیئر ہولڈرز اور ایڈیشنل Tier I اور ماتحت Tier II کے ہولڈرز کا بھی شکرہ ادا کرتے ہیں کہ انہوں نے میزبان ہیڈ کو ملک میں ایک سرکردہ اسلای ہیڈ کے طور پر قائم کرنے کے لیے مسلسل سر پرستی کی۔

اسلای ہیکاری کا مشن آگے بڑھانے کے لیے ہم اپنی پرعزم ٹیم کے ہر کن کو ان کی مستعد کوششوں اور ثابت قدمی کے لیے خراج تحسین پیش کرنا چاہتے ہیں۔ سب سے بڑھ کر ہم ماہبڑی کے ساتھ اپنے ہیڈ اور ہم میں سے ہر ایک پر اللہ تعالی کی مسلسل تعنتوں کا اعتراف کرتے ہیں اور اس کا شکرہ ادا کرتے ہیں، جس نے نسبتا مختصر وقت کے اندر ہماری قابل ذکر کامیابیاں کو ممکن بنایا ہے۔ ہم اس کی مسلسل خوشفودی کے لیے اُس سے اتکا کرتے ہیں، ہمیں "اسلای ہیکاری کو پہلی نیند کی ہیڈنگ کے طور پر قائم کرنے" کے اپنے دلان کو آگے بڑھانے کے لیے ہمت اور ہمسیرت عطا کرے۔

1.2 The Bank was granted a 'Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank' license on January 31, 2002 and formally commenced operations as a Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank with effect from March 20, 2002, on receiving notification in this regard from the State Bank of Pakistan (the SBP) under section 37 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956. Currently, the Bank is engaged in corporate, commercial, consumer, investment and retail banking activities.
1.3 The Bank was operating through one thousand and fifteen branches as at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: one thousand and four branches). Its registered office is at Meezan House, C-25, Estate Avenue, SITE, Karachi, Pakistan.
1.4 The VIS Credit Rating Company Limited (VIS) has reaffirmed the Bank's medium to long-term rating as 'AAA' and short-term rating as 'A1+' on June 28, 2024 (2023: 'AAA' and 'A1+' dated June 27, 2023).

## 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Resident Shariah Board Member (RSBM) of the Bank.

## 3 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

3.1 These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;

<!-- Page 21 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting". They do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

### 3.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting And reporting standards that are effective in the current period:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2024 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under note 5.2.

### 3.3 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and Reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

## 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

4.1 These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims which are stated at revalued amounts; investment classified at fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income, commitments in respect of certain foreign exchange contracts which are measured at fair value; defined benefit obligations which are carried at present value; and right of use of assets and related lease liability measured at present value on initial recognition.

### 4.2 Functional and presentation currency

Items included in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates. These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.

### 4.3 Rounding off

Figures have been rounded off to the nearest thousand rupees unless otherwise stated.

### 4.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are the same as that applied in the preparation of the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 5.2.

## 5 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for changes mentioned in notes 5.1 and 5.2.

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Bank are consistent with those disclosed in the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

### 5.1 Adoption of new forms for the preparation of condensed interim financial statements

The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and BPRD Circular No. 07 dated April 13, 2023, issued the revised formats of the annual / interim financial statements which are applicable for the preparation of condensed interim quarterly / half yearly financial statements, periods beginning on or after



<!-- Page 22 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

January 01, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023). The implementation of the revised formats has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is that the right of use assets and corresponding lease liability are now presented separately on the face of statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (previously titled fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. As a result of this change, the property and equipment of the Bank decreased by Rs 20,941 million and Rs 19,572 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. Furthermore, other liabilities of the Bank decreased by Rs 25,186 million and Rs 22,094 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to current period presentation, as presented in note 40.

### 5.2 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 17, 2023, IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 (previously January 01, 2023) for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2022. Moreover, SBP has also issued application instructions on IFRS 9 for banks in Pakistan for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of accounting for financial liabilities. To determine appropriate classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be assessed based on combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics. The adoption of IFRS 9 has also fundamentally changed the impairment method of financial assets with a forward-looking Expected Credit Losses (ECL) approach.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has made certain amendments and extended the timelines of SBP's IFRS 9 Application Instructions to address most of the matters raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by the extended timelines.

There are a few matters which include income recognition on islamic financings, maintenance of general provision, and fair valuation of subsidised financings, the treatments of which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

### 5.2.1 Classification

## Financial assets

Under IFRS 9, existing categories of financial assets: Held for Trading (HFT), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held to Maturity (HTM) and loans and receivables have been replaced by:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss account (FVTPL)


## Financial liabilities

Under IFRS 9, the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as before adoption of IFRS 9 and thus all financial liabilities are being carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities can also be designated at FVTPL where gains or losses arising from entity's own credit rating risk relating to, are required to be presented in other comprehensive income with no reclassification to profit or loss account. The Bank does not have any financial liability measured at FVTPL.

### 5.2.2 Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:



<!-- Page 23 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED 

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

- The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual revenue, maintaining a particular yield profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed; and
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank's assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank's original expectations, the Bank does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. These securities are classified in the 'other' business model and measured at FVTPL.

Eventually, the financial assets fall under either of the following three business models:
i Hold to Collect (HTC) Business Model: Holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
ii Hold to Collect and Sell (HTC\&S) Business Model: Collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
iii Other Business Models: Resulting in classification of financial assets as FVTPL.

### 5.2.3 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI)

As a second step of its classification process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 'Principal' for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium / discount). The most significant elements of profit within a financing arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the profit rate is set. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with basic financing arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.

### 5.2.4 Application to Bank's financial assets

## Debt based financial assets

Debt based financial assets held by the Bank includes: Islamic financing and related assets, investment in federal government securities and other government / private sukuk, due from financial institutions, cash and balances with treasury banks; balances with other banks; and other financial assets.
a) These are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- the assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding.

The Bank's business model for these financial assets can still be HTC even when sales of these financial assets occur. However, if more than an infrequent number of sale of significant value are made, the Bank assess whether and how the sales are consistent with the HTC objective. This assessment include the reasons for the sales, the expected frequency of sales, and whether the assets that are sold are held for an extended period of time relative to their contractual maturities.



<!-- Page 24 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

b) Aforementioned financial assets are measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:

- the asset are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding. c) Aforementioned financial assets, if held for trading purposes are measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The application of these policies also resulted in classifications and consequent remeasurements of certain investments in GoP ijarah sukuk held under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 based on business model. Moreover, the Bank's investment in sub-ordinated sukuks issued by other Banks under available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassified as FVTPL since they do not pass the SPPI criteria due to equity conversion features embedded in the terms of these sukuks. Additionally, the Bank, has elected to classify investment in Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates (previously classified under Available for Sale portfolio) as at December 31, 2023 at FVTPL.

## Equity based financial assets

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual share in the issuer's net assets.

The Bank measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Bank's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Bank's policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than for trading. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the unconsolidated statement profit and loss account, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account as income when the Bank's right to receive payments is established.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reversed impairment of Rs 2,562 million on equity investment held as at December 31, 2023 and the same has been transferred

to deficit on revaluation of investments through remeasurements. Gains and losses on equity instruments at FVTPL are included in the 'Gain on sales of securities' line in the unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

The measurement category and carrying amounts of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 1, 2024 are compared as follows:

### 5.2.5 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchase or sell the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like Islamic financing and related assets, due from financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers' account or financial institutions or as per underlying Shariah mode. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased. The Bank will recognise due to customer and financial institution balances when these funds reach the Bank.

## a) Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit income / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account.

## b) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction cost. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for these financial assets in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account only in case of debt instruments. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit on revaluations of assets to unappropriated profit.

## c) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost will be directly recorded in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. Rental / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

### 5.2.6 Derecognition

## Financial assets

Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Bank has not retained control.

The Bank enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as 'pass through' transfers that result in derecognition if the Bank:
(i) Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;
(ii) Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and
(iii) Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.

Collateral (shares and sukuks) furnished by the Bank under due from and due to institutions are not derecognised because the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met.

## Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when these are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).

The exchange between the Bank and its original participants of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least $10 \%$ different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of profit rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration.

If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.

### 5.2.7 Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.



<!-- Page 27 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance ; and
- The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.


### 5.2.8 Modification

The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and shall recognise a modification gain or loss in condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account. The gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset's original effective profit rate (or credit-adjusted effective profit rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

### 5.2.9 Overview of the expected credit loss (ECL) principles

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with Islamic financing and related assets and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months' expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined below.

The 12 mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12 mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument's credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject customer. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer / facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 60 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank rebuts 60 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Bank applies the similar principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

IFRS 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below:

Stage 1: When financial instruments are first recognised, the Bank recognises an allowance based on 12 mECLs . Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and they have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12 mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12 mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure at default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected Loss given default (LGD) and discounted by an approximation to the original effective profit rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

Stage 2: When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but probability of default (PD) are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

Stage 3: For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Bank recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these instruments. The Bank uses a PD of 100\% and LGD as computed for each portfolio or as prescribed by the SBP under the prudential regulations which ever is higher.

Purchased or
originated
credit impaired
(POCI):

Undrawn financing commitments

POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit / rental is subsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.

When estimating LTECLs for undrawn financings commitments, the Bank estimates the expected portion of the financings commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the financings is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios.

For revolving facilities that include both a financings and an undrawn commitment. ECLs are calculated on un-drawn portion of the facility and presented within other liabilities.

Guarantee and letters of credit contracts

The Bank estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs is recognised within other liabilities.

## The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:



<!-- Page 29 -->

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

PD The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank's internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the past 7 years. PDs for non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

EAD The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and profit, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued profit from missed payments. The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier. The Bank's product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail facilities, in which the Bank has the right to cancel and / or reduce the facilities with one day notice. However, in case of revolving facilities, the Bank does not limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, but, instead calculates ECL over a period that reflects the Bank's expectations of the customer behaviour, its likelihood of default and the Bank's future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities.

LGD The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective profit rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective profit rate (at reporting date), the Bank uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

Effective profit rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liabilities to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three scenarios (a base case, an upside, a downside). Each of these is associated with different PDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financing are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The Bank considers only those collaterals as eligible collaterals in the EAD calculation which have the following characteristics:

- History of legal certainty and enforceability
- History of enforceability and recovery.

The Bank's management has only considered cash, liquid Securities, gold, and Government of Pakistan guarantees as eligible collaterals in the LGD calculation. All of these collaterals have a 0\% haircut other than equity securities where haircut of $15 \%$ is applied.

The credit exposure (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL calculation.

The SBP has issued FAQs in its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 with regard to certain interpretation of the SBP application instructions. In respect of Stage 3 provision, the SBP has clarified that the banks, while assessing the higher of IFRS 9 ECL and provision under the SBP Prudential Regulations, shall take into account the ECL against corporate / commercial / SME financing portfolios at the borrower / facility level, and for the retail financing at segment / product basis.

## Forward looking information

In its ECL models, the Bank relies on a range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as:

- GDP growth
- Volume of exports of goods
- Consumer price index
- Unemployment rate


## Definition of default

The Bank defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:

The customer is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments, except in case of agriculture, project infrastructure and housing financing. This implies that if one facility of a counterparty is defaulted as per the definition; all other facilities would deem to be classified as stage 3.

Further the following qualitative criteria has been determined for assessment of default:

- The Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security (if held).
- The Bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the Bank taking on the exposure.
- The Bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, profit or (where relevant) fees.
- The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the industry group.


## Write-offs

The Bank's accounting policy under IFRS 9 remains the same as it was under SBP regulations / existing reporting framework.

### 23.3 Other contingent liabilities

The Income Tax Department amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2023. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against Islamic financing and related assets, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase, non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East - Pakistan Branches and the levy of super tax were also raised. The matter has been decided in Bank's favour by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. Both the Bank and the tax department filed a reference with the High Court of Sindh in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East - Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

## 36 FAIR VALUE INSTRUMENT

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost / held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified as amortised cost / held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies which are best reflective of their business model in accordance with the SBP application instructions. The fair value of unquoted debt securities that are not available, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of acurrent and active

market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer financing and deposits, are frequently repriced.

### 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured as at September 30, 2024 and December 31,2023 by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfactions of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values.

## Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values

|  Item | Valuation approach and input used  |
| --- | --- |
|  Listed Securities | The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange.  |
|  GoP Sukuk | The fair value of GoP Ijarah sukuks listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange has been determined
through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The fair value of other GoP Ijarah sukuks
quoted are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial
Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes
received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.  |
|  Foreign Sukuk | These are measured at fair value using the rates published by the valuation expert portal (Bloomberg).  |
|  Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.  |
|  Non-banking assets acquired
in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in
the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.  |
|  Mutual Funds | The valuation has been determined based on net asset values (NAV) declared by respective funds.  |
|  Unquoted Equity Securities | The value of unquoted equity securities are determined by using different methods for different securities.
Fair value of investment in one of the unquoted investee has been determined by Dividend Discount Model
(DDM) by using constant dividends streams of the entity by using various key assumptions considering
economic and market conditions. Key assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate (if applicable).  |
|  Corporate sukuks | The valuation has been determined through closing rates announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters.  |

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year. The valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims, mentioned above, is conducted by the valuation expert appointed by the Bank which is also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation expert uses a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's non-banking asset acquired in satisfaction of claims. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. This value is adjusted to reflect the current condition of the property. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuation cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

The sensitivity analysis of the fair value measurement of unquoted equity securities due to changes in observable inputs has not been disclosed as the amount is not material and significant.
