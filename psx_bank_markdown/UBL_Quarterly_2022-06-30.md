# DIRECTORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the financial statements of United Bank Limited (UBL) for the half year ended June 30, 2022.

## Performance Overview

On a standalone basis, UBL recorded Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 34.2 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2022, a strong growth of $32 \%$ year on year. The bank also maintained its trajectory of expansion in earnings this quarter as PBT is up 16\% Q2'22 versus Q1'22.

The Bank's gross revenues were recorded at Rs. 59.8 billion for H1'22, an increase of 29\% year on year. Net mark-up income stood at Rs. 45.1 billion for H1'22, a strong growth of $29 \%$ versus last year. Non-markup income of Rs. 14.7 billion was earned in H1'22 (H1'21: Rs. 11.4 billion), well ahead of last year, owing to significant increase in foreign exchange income as well as strong growth across all major fee-based revenues.

The bank's operating expenses stood at Rs. 24.1 billion for H1'22, a growth of 19\% over H1'21, a result of significantly higher inflation levels. Cost to income ratio improved further to $40.3 \%$ for H1'22 as against $43.4 \%$ in the corresponding period of last year.

The bank recorded a net provisioning expense of Rs. 0.8 billion for H1'22, this charge was mainly to build coverage against foreign bonds, offset by strong NPL recoveries across both domestic and international.

## Financial Highlights

On a standalone basis, UBL recorded Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 11.9 billion for H1'22 versus a PAT of Rs. 15.0 billion for H1'21. Earnings per share (EPS) was measured at Rs. 9.69 for H1'22 (H1'21: Rs. 12.25). The current reporting period includes a one-off taxation adjustment with respect to prior years, a result of revisions in the Finance Act 2022.

On a consolidated basis, UBL recorded PAT of Rs. 12.2 billion (H1'21: Rs. 15.0 billion). The consolidated EPS was measured at Rs. 9.77 for H1'22 (H1'21: Rs. 12.24).

## Net Markup Income

Net markup income was recorded at Rs. 45.1 billion for H1'22, with a growth of 29\% year on year. The bank's markup earning assets averaged Rs. 2.1 trillion in H1'22, growing by 16\% year on year. Bank level Net interest margins (NIMs) were measured at $4.5 \%$ for H1'22 (H1'21: 4.0\%).

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased the policy rate from $7.0 \%$ at Jun'21 to $15.0 \%$ in the last one year up to Jul'22. This was to counter the effects of rising inflation, significant increase in global commodity prices and a weakening domestic currency. Benchmark interest rates averaged $11.2 \%$ in H1'22 versus $7.0 \%$ in H1'21, which improved earning margins over the corresponding period of last year.

Domestic deposits averaged Rs. 1.5 trillion in H1'22, growing by 7\% over last year i.e. an incremental increase of Rs. 94 billion. Domestic CASA deposits averaged Rs. 1.3 trillion for H1'22, with a growth of 9\% year on year, with a growth in the deposits base of Rs. 111 billion. The average CASA to total deposits ratio continued to



<!-- Page 6 -->

strengthen and was measured at $87.1 \%$ in H1'22 (H1'21: 85.1\%). The bank added approximately 302,000 new current account relationships in H1'21 as against 290,000 current account relationships in the corresponding period of last year. This resulted in average current deposits recording a growth of $12 \%$ year on year to Rs. 691 billion in H1'22. Resultantly, the average current to total deposits ratio improved to $45.2 \%$ in H1'22 from $43.1 \%$ in H1'21. The domestic portfolio of savings accounts averaged Rs. 641 billion in H1'22, with a steady increase of $6 \%$ year on year. The domestic cost of deposits was measured at $5.1 \%$ as against $3.4 \%$ in the corresponding period of last year, thus remaining relatively well contained despite the sharp increase in interest rates in the last 12 months.

Bank level performing advances averaged Rs. 640 billion for H1'22, growing by 19\% year on year. Domestic performing advances averaged Rs. 503 billion for H1'22, with an increase of $15 \%$, with a cautious build up across the Corporate and SME segments. The Islamic loan book increased over two-folds over the corresponding period of last year to average Rs. 63 billion in H1'22.

# Economy Review 

The domestic economy remained under severe stress in the first half of 2022 as prices of food, fuel and energy remained highly elevated. As the world adjusts to supply chain disruptions aggravated by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, substantial increase in domestic inflation levels have put a significant strain on the country's foreign exchange reserves.

The Rupee has depreciated by a significant 33\% since Dec'21, from Rs. 178 / USD on December 31, 2021, to Rs. 236 / USD on July 27, 2022. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has raised interest rates by a cumulative 525 bps since Dec'21, including the 125 bps increase in its most recent meeting held on July 07, 2022, taking the benchmark rate to $15.0 \%$.

The country's import bill continues to soar, as the Current Account recorded a deficit of USD 15.2 billion for 11M FY'22 versus USD 1.2 billion for the corresponding period of last fiscal year. The country's balance of trade recorded a deficit of USD 48.4 billion for FY'22, with an increase of 56\%. Led by the textile sector, the country's exports picked up well in FY'22 recorded at USD 31.8 billion, growing by a strong 26\%. However, the import bill grew significantly this year, due to the high cost of energy imports, and was recorded at USD 80.2 billion for FY'22, up 42\% year on year. Home remittances continue to make a significant contribution to the country's external position with inflows of USD 31.2 billion for FY'22 and despite a slowdown in the global economy recorded an increase of $6 \%$.

The recent taxation and fiscal consolidation measures with a pass through of high energy costs to domestic consumers have laid the grounds to the resumption of the IMF program. However, this has led to a significant increase in CPI inflation levels, which was recorded at a historic high of $21.3 \%$ for the month of Jun'22. Inflation levels averaged $12.1 \%$ for FY'22 versus $8.9 \%$ for FY'21. The economy is bound to face a slowdown in times ahead with the consumption impact of rising domestic prices. These will be elevated in the medium term and is likely to exert pressure on the country's ability to meet its external financing obligations.

The KSE-100 index also remained impacted by the current economic crisis but remained relatively resilient and closed at 41,541 points as at Jun 30, 2022, declining by $7 \%$ since Dec'21. Deposits for the banking sector stood at Rs. 22.8 trillion at Jun'22, up 9\% since Dec'21, while banking sector advances closed at Rs. 10.9 trillion at Jun'22, up 7\% over Dec'21. Non-performing loans for the banking industry stood at Rs. 864 billion at Mar'22, slightly above the levels at Dec'21, as the asset quality improved slightly from $7.9 \%$ at Dec'21 to $7.8 \%$ at Mar'22.

Net markup income was recorded at USD 24.2 million in H1'22, in line with last year. Non markup income of USD 7.2 million was earned in H1'22 as against USD 18.4 million earned last year, which was higher due to capital gains. Operating expenses were recorded at USD 15.0 million, in line with last year. The business recorded a net provision charge of USD 6.2 million for H1'22, mainly arising on its Sri Lanka sovereign debt holdings, as against a net provision charge of USD 6.6 million incurred on the loan portfolio last year.

UBL International's deposits averaged USD 1.3 billion for H1'22, slightly ahead of last year. Cost of deposits was reduced from $1.2 \%$ in H1'21 to $1.0 \%$ in H1'22. Performing advances averaged USD 740 million for H1'22, with a steady growth of $15 \%$. The foreign debt investment portfolio averaged USD 674 million and earned the bank a consistent and healthy yield of $5.3 \%$ during H1'22.

UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED

JUNE 30, 2022
(Un-audited)



<!-- Page 12 -->

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT 

## To the members of United Bank Limited

## Report on Review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Information

## Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of United Bank Limited (the Bank) as at 30 June 2022, the related unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, and notes to the financial information for the six-months period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "interim financial information"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial information in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the financial information based on our review. The figures of the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income for the quarters ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 have not been subject to limited scope review by us as we are only required to review the cumulative figures for the sixmonths period ended 30 June 2022.

## Scope of review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

## Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

## Other Matter

The financial statements for the Bank for the six-month period ended 30 June 2021 and for the year ended 31 December 2021 were reviewed and audited by another firm of chartered accountants who have expressed unmodified conclusion and unmodified opinion vide their review report and audit report issued on 25 August 2021 and 7 March 2022 respectively.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Arslan Khalid.

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED) 

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022


#### Abstract

The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014. However, vide its notification SRO 56 (I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, it has been notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under trust structure.

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated March 22, 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the information and disclosures required in preparation of audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.


These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent the separate condensed interim financial statements of the Bank. The consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies are presented separately.

### 2.2 Standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting standards that are effective in the current period

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. These are either considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant impact and accordingly, have not been detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

### 2.3 Standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting standards that are not yet effective

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular no. 3 dated July 05, 2022, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments has been made applicable to Banks in Pakistan for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023 (for banks having asset size of Rs. 500 billion or above). The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is being assessed.

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions from January 01, 2018. Accordingly, the requirements of this standard are incorporated in the Bank's unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

There are certain other new amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023, but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and are, therefore, not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

## 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.

## 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Bank has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

20.1 The Income Tax returns of the Bank have been filed up to the tax year 2021 (accounting year ended December 31, 2020) and were deemed to be assessed under section 120 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance).

The income tax authorities have issued amended assessment orders for the tax years 2003 to 2021, and created additional tax demands (including disallowances of provisions made prior to Seventh Schedule) of Rs. 14,970 million (2021: Rs. 13,752 million). The Bank has filed appeals before the various appellate forums against these amendments. Where the appellate authorities have allowed relief on certain issues, the assessing authorities have filed appeals before higher appellate forums. Where the appellate authorities have not allowed relief the Bank has filed appeals before higher appellate forums. The management of the Bank is confident that the appeals will be decided in favor of the Bank.

The tax returns for Azad Kashmir (AK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) Branches have been filed upto the tax year 2021 under the provisions of section 120(1) read with section 114 of the Ordinance and in compliance with the terms of the agreement between banks and the Azad Kashmir Council in May 2005. The returns filed are considered as deemed assessment orders under the law.

The tax authorities have also carried out monitoring for Federal Excise Duty, Sales tax and withholding taxes covering period from year ended 2005 to 2019. Consequently various addbacks and demands were raised creating a total demand of Rs. 2,632 million (2021: Rs. 2,632 million). The Bank has filed appeals against all such demands and is confident that these would be decided in the favor of the Bank.

The tax returns for Yemen have been filed upto the year ended December 31, 2019 and for UAE and Qatar branches upto the year ended December 31, 2021 under the provisions of the laws prevailing in the respective countries, and are deemed as assessed unless opened for reassessment.

The Bank has received corrective tax assessment of QAR 642 thousand (Rs. 32.695 million) from the General tax Authority (GTA) in respect of tax year 2015. Management has filed an appeal against the said penalty and is confident that the matters will be decided in favor of the Bank and the possibility of any outcome against it is remote.

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security).

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.
22.3.2 During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.
22.3.3 For contingencies relating to taxation, refer note 20.1.

The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.
34.1 The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:
Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

34.1.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3.

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Federal Government securities | The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the <br> prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / <br> Bloomberg. |
| Non-Government debt securities | The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the <br> prices / rates from MUFAP. |
| Foreign debt securities | The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is <br> determined using the rates from Bloomberg. |
| Mutual Fund units | The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on <br> their net asset values as published at the close of each business day. |
| Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward <br> Government securities transactions | The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward <br> Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing <br> calculations. |
| Derivatives | The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models <br> using present value calculations. |
| Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in <br> satisfaction of claims | Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims <br> are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is <br> based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of <br> changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be <br> determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity <br> has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial <br> statements. |

## 39. YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the two central banks regulators, i.e. CBY Sana'a and CBY Aden, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana'a to facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch's control. UBL is cognizant of the associated risks of ceasing its branch's business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.

## 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021.

## 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Group has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the consolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

The effect of these changes on depreciation expense in the current period / year and the next year is as follows:

|  | January - June <br> 2022 | January - <br> December <br> 2022 | January - <br> December <br> 2023 |

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Group's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Group is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.
24.3.2 During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.
24.3.3 Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice to UBL Fund Managers Limited requiring them to pay sales tax under Punjab sales tax on Service Act 2012 on management fee earned in Punjab from May 22, 2013.

There were no convertible dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding as at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.

## 36. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.
36.1 The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED)

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 36.1.1 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3.

|  Item | Valuation approach and input used  |
| --- | --- |
|  Federal Government securities | The fair value of Federal Government securities is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Bloomberg.  |
|  Non-Government debt securities | The fair value of non-government debt securities is determined using the prices / rates from MUFAP.  |
|  Foreign debt securities | The fair value of foreign corporate and foreign government securities is determined using the rates from Bloomberg.  |
|  Mutual Fund units | The fair values of investments in mutual fund units are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.  |
|  Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions | The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.  |
|  Derivatives | The fair valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.  |
|  Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.  |

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UN-AUDITED) 

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022

## 41. YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the two central banks regulators, i.e. CBY Sana'a and CBY Aden, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana'a to facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch's control. UBL is cognizant of the associated risks of ceasing its branch's business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.
