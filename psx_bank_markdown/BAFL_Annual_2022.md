# HOW IT ALL BEGAN!

Over 25 years ago, the Abu Dhabi Group shareholders, led by the Founder Chairman, His Highness Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, acquired Habib Credit and Exchange Bank Limited with a vision to transform the banking landscape and improve access to finance. The Founder Chairman has always had a great affinity with Pakistan, and this investment was a testament to his belief in the great potential of the people in the country.

The institution was subsequently renamed 'Bank Alfalah' and became known as the caring bank, with customer-centricity and innovation at the heart of its values. These values continue to guide the institution 25 years on.

For over two decades now, Bank Alfalah has evolved into a leading Commercial, Retail, Islamic and Digital Bank, which is recognised for its dynamism, innovation and customer-centricity.

The Chairman’s commitment to Bank Alfalah demonstrates his dedication to elevating financial services and bridging the gap between customers and the financial industry.

Thanks to the guidance and leadership of the Chairman, the Board, and the dedication of the employees in Pakistan, Bank Alfalah has evolved into an institution that significantly contributes to the growth and prosperity of the industry.

OUR HERITAGE AND PRIDE
The story of bringing the Founder Chairman’s vision of the transformation of the banking industry to life started with three branches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi, laying the groundwork for future expansion centered on customer-centricity and innovation.

Built before partition in 1914, Shaahdin Manzil, a heritage landmark with historical significance, was home to one of the three branches. In 2001, Bank Alfalah worked with stakeholders and financed the upgradation of the architectural monument.

The Bank has played a vital role in revitalising another stunning heritage landmark building on II Chundrigar, which has been the cornerstone of the financial industry of Pakistan for decades. The hallmark building now serves as the Bank’s Head Office.

# CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE



Chairman’s Message - 2022

It gives me immense pleasure to present the Annual Report of Bank Alfalah Limited. The year 2022 has been one of subdued growths for Pakistan, with damage and disruption caused by catastrophic floods, a tight monetary stance, high inflation, and a less conducive global environment. The floods had a substantial negative impact on Pakistan’s economy and on the poor, mostly through the disruption of agricultural production. Our prayers and thoughts are with those who were impacted by the flood.

Global growth remained relatively slow in 2022 despite eased COVID-19 restrictions. Key impediments to growth were higher than expected inflation worldwide, global output contraction, climate change impact, tighter financial conditions and spillovers from the war in Ukraine. These challenges continue to impact global economies including Pakistan.

# Marking 25 years

2023 marks the 25th year of Bank Alfalah in Pakistan. The Abu Dhabi Group acquired the operations of Bank Alfalah in 1997 and since then the Bank has evolved as one of the most preferred financial partners of corporate, SME and retail customers. The Bank has over 850 branches across Pakistan and is connected with its customers through 60,000+ touchpoints. It offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to cater to the growing needs of customers from various business segments.

During the last 25 years, the Bank remained fundamentally true to its vision, its ethos and purpose have grown and evolved. Bank Alfalah has accorded highest priority to providing quality service and great customer experience. Our motto is to nurture the best teams, develop strong relationships with the right vendors and suppliers, and to give back to the community.

Today, Bank Alfalah is a tech savvy bank with strategic focus on accessibility and digital inclusion. We continue to innovate and invest in our digital capabilities to complement our strong branch network, enabling our customers to bank how and where they want. We strive every day to improve and make it both simple and easy for customers to manage their finances with us. We continue to create innovative, convenient and comprehensive digital solutions for our customers.

The performance of the Bank in terms of growth and profitability, and our strong equity base is a result of the focused execution of our strategy over the years. The Bank’s consistent focus on growing its deposit franchise, especially deposits at low or no cost, has enabled it to be a competitive lender. The balance sheet is now more resilient, and the business model is more robust to ride out volatile periods and achieve long-term growth and profitability.

Over the years, Bank Alfalah has been a leading facilitator of national economic development; the Bank is a trusted partner in SME lending, and a leading player in trade, cash management, home remittance and employee banking business. We have also garnered a strong reputation as a preferred employer. All of this has contributed towards the Bank receiving numerous accolades locally and internationally.

Our employees have demonstrated immense professionalism and dedication throughout our journey since 1997. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all employees for their commitment and hard work, and for upholding the ethos of the Bank Alfalah brand. The Board is committed to ensuring that Bank Alfalah is a forward looking and resilient organisation with a focus on long-term value creation. Our business is grounded by strong corporate governance and risk management practices, and our philosophy of being a reliable and dependable bank. Our commitment to becoming Pakistan’s leading bank is stronger than ever and we continue to value and build our brand and image.

# Flood Relief

Bank Alfalah stands firm on its promise to help rebuild flood affected areas and has formulated a two-phase plan of redeveloping communities in a sustainable, equitable and financially inclusive way. Earlier in August 2022, Bank Alfalah’s Board of Directors approved USD 10 million (PKR 2,180 million) to help with the extensive relief and rebuilding efforts. The pledged amount is being distributed through donations via select NGOs and organizations to provide immediate relief, with a substantial amount earmarked for rebuilding.





infrastructure in the medium to long term. While no financial sum suffices in the face of such devastation and irreversible loss, we are hopeful that our contribution will serve to partially alleviate the suffering of the affected. This gesture by the Board of Bank Alfalah is a testament to the strong bond between UAE and Pakistan and reaffirms the strong positioning of Bank Alfalah as a truly caring bank.

# Forward Looking Statement

Our vision is to continue to build our deposit base, grow our market share in low-cost deposits, and expand our domestic footprint to widen our reach while continuing to provide unparalleled services to our customers. We will focus on harnessing technology to ensure that our customers’ banking needs are satisfied. Emphasis will remain on facilitating trade, aiming to maintain our leadership position in home remittances and increasing penetration in cash management and bank-at-work space.

# Banking Awards

Bank Alfalah, for its efforts and success in introducing innovative and transformative offerings and simplifying and easing customers’ banking experience through its digital services, was commemorated by the prestigious Institute of Bankers Pakistan (IBP) at the Pakistan Banking Awards. The Bank was conferred with ‘Best Digital Banking’ and ‘Best Bank in Housing Finance’ awards at the Pakistan Banking Awards 2022. It was recognised for winning its customers’ trust and providing end-to-end banking services and the convenience of financial transactions from the comfort of the customer’s location. It remains our strategic focus and vision to innovate and continually evolve our product suite to exceed customer expectations.

# Economic Opportunities

Optimally located at the crossroads of Asia, Pakistan has the potential to become a regional economic hub, ideal for investments and opportunities leading to job creation. Pakistan can leverage its strategic location through connectivity and economic integration with its neighbours creating an economic corridor which could provide impetus to ambitious projects and business goals. This would help in upskilling local communities, which continue to strive for localized value development, effectively turning Pakistan’s growing population into an asset. Additionally, implementation of a more conducive policy framework would enhance the business ecosystem and increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and investor interest.

Pakistan is also blessed with a diverse geography, which allows diverse livestock farming and crops, as well as production of food commodities and other related products. Planned investment in agriculture would be helpful on multiple fronts including food security, poverty alleviation and provision of quality raw material for industries, particularly the textile sector. This will help earn critical foreign exchange directly and indirectly, and build reserves. Structural reforms in key areas, including rationalizing regulations and taxation of businesses, are crucial to propelling the country’s economic growth.

# PRESIDENT AND CEO MESSAGE



# 30 BANK ALFALAH





# In 2022, the world experienced a transition as it began recovering from the pandemic's impacts.

While some stability was achieved through economic recovery, we soon started facing new challenges due to a global economic downturn fueled by supply-chain disruptions and the unprecedented destruction caused by floods in Pakistan.

The Bank and its vast network of branches made a concerted effort to help those in need, showing our commitment to being a caring Bank. Thanks to the Chairman and the Board's generous support, we were at the forefront of providing relief and rescue to the impacted ones. The Bank continues to disburse the pledged amount to over 21 reliable and trusted charity partners across Pakistan.

Despite the numerous complexities, our performance has been outstanding. I extend my sincerest gratitude to all teams for embodying our values and living up to our One Bank, One Team motto, thus enabling the Bank to deliver exceptional service to our customers and communities.

We continued the journey with an impressive growth trajectory in 2022 with our transformative strategy, which places customer-centricity at the forefront of all our initiatives. By working in collaboration, we have created synergies throughout the Bank based on strategic pillars centered on the accomplishment of these five crucial elements:

- Amplifying market shares and improving profitability.
- Enhancing transactional convenience and capabilities across customer segments.
- Developing a unique Bank Alfalah culture based on customer-centricity, teamwork and engagement with colleagues, families, and communities.
- Engendering innovation, driving investment in technology and digital capabilities.
- Establishing strategic partnerships to enhance our range of products and services.

With an evolving banking landscape, we are mindful that customers' needs are changing, new ideas are budding, and requirements are mounting. In 2023, we will remain unwavering in our commitment to putting our customers first and continuously raising the bar for service standards through ongoing innovation and technological progress.

In 2023, we will be confronted with various socio-economic challenges. To overcome these hurdles, we must firmly stand together, be committed to our values and continuously look for opportunities to positively contribute towards finding a better way forward.

Amid the unparalleled disaster caused by floods in our country, we stepped up to provide aid to those affected. Our benevolent Chairman, His Highness Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, and the Board were moved by the remarkable resilience and strength of character demonstrated by the people of Pakistan. To alleviate the suffering of those impacted, the Chairman and Board pledged USD 10 million towards relief and reconstruction efforts.

The video on the Bank’s overview, business performance, strategy and outlook is uploaded on the website.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
# Directors’ Report To The Shareholders

Dear Shareholders, worsened key economic indicators and rating downgrade.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Directors' Report of the Bank along with the audited financial statements and auditor’s reports for the year ended December 31, 2022.

# Economic Review

# Global Economy

2022 has been marked by the advent of the Russia-Ukraine war which has compounded economic challenges globally. Spillovers from the war in the wake of Covid, just as restrictions were being eased, had an adverse effect on the energy supply-chain across Europe with repercussions across the globe. Heightened fear of a global recession pushed central banks to tighten money supply in an attempt to contain inflation.

Pakistan closed FY2022 (Jul-Jun) with GDP growth of 5.97%, surpassing the 5.0% target and previous year growth rate of 5.7%. This is attributable to policies supporting consumption, production and post-Covid recovery. All major economic sectors registered impressive growth:

- i) agriculture sector +4.4%
- ii) industrial sector +7.2%
- iii) services sector +6.2%.

However, growth trends were largely neutralized by challenges faced later in the year.

Headline inflation averaged 19.7% in 2022 compared to 9.5% in 2021, as a result of commodity super-cycle, flooding, tariff hikes, subsidy reversal and PKR devaluation. Food inflation remained elevated throughout the year, peaking during the floods while energy prices increased as the Government increased utilities tariffs, reduced subsidies and passed on petroleum price surges. Ripple effects have translated into more persistent core inflation that hovered around 16% during the last quarter of 2022. In response to this and to manage the Balance of Payments, SBP hiked policy rate to 17% from 9.75% at the start of the year.

Balance of Payments remained under pressure during the year with commodity surge inflating Current Account Deficit (CAD). However, with effective policy action on both monetary and fiscal front, CAD during Jul-Nov 2022 eased to USD 3.1 bn, down 57% YoY. Trade Deficit reduced by 7% to USD 31.6 bn in 11MCY22, whereas Remittances reduced by 3.8% to USD 27.5 bn in 11MCY22.

On a positive note, global inflation is likely to come under control in 2023, down to 6.5% compared to an estimated 8.8% in 2022.

# Domestic Economy

Pakistan’s Foreign Exchange Reserves held by the SBP on Dec 30, 2022 stood at USD 5.6 bn compared to USD 17.7 bn on Dec 31, 2021. This translates into an import cover of less than a month. As a result, Pakistani Rupee remains extremely volatile. During 2022, the Rupee was at a low of 174.5 and high of 239.9 to the US Dollar and closed the year at 22% devaluation. However, Pakistan repaid its USD 1.0 bn Sukuk Eurobond as scheduled, negating markets fears of default.

Though some stability has been achieved with a new Finance Minister assuming charge and taking regulatory and administrative measures, the widening gap between Interbank and Open Market rate and a growing parallel grey market remains a concern.

Fiscal side also remains challenging with the deficit increasing to 7.9% of GDP in FY22 compared to 6.1% in FY21. During the year, tax collection increased by a decent 28%, however, there has been a 21% drop in non-tax.

32  BANK ALFALAH


DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Revenue due to non-materialization of budgeted inflows resulting in effective overall revenue growth of 16%. Current expenditures increased by 27% due to rising debt servicing cost and subsidies and grants. Recently announced austerity measures in the Federal Budget are steps in the right direction however, rehabilitation costs for flood impact would keep the fiscal deficit elevated.

As the macroeconomic and political situation unfolded, Pakistan equities remained bearish and volatile with the benchmark KSE-100 index falling by 9.4% in 2022. The equity market started the year on a positive note amid foreign buying, IMF tranche disbursement and international sukuk bond issuance. However, political uncertainties, macroeconomic deterioration and floods marred market sentiment as the year progressed. Foreign investors remained sellers; net outflow of USD 48 mn was witnessed, within which foreign corporates sold stocks of USD 127 mn. Locally, mutual funds and insurance sector remained on the selling side which was absorbed by individuals, companies and banks.

# Outlook of the economy

Fiscal and monetary actions are hard steps but would help in bringing sustainability and resilience to the macro outlook. Import control measures have started reflecting in trade numbers while some relief on the commodity prices could contain inflation reading in 2H2023 although a lot would ride on the timing of energy price adjustments. Concrete diplomatic efforts brought stability and have helped in the recently convened Geneva conference, with pledges of more than USD 9.0 bn by donors to help Pakistan recover from devastating floods. However, resumption of IMF program remains vital along with the continuity of sustainable economic policy by building consensus.

# Outlook of the banking sector

Despite the challenges of inflation, FX volatility and trade, banking sector outlook remains positive. Improved banking spreads are likely to continue while credit quality and capital adequacy are likely to remain core focus areas. The SBP introduced Licensing and Regulatory Framework for digital banks in line with international best practices early last year. The regulator received 20 applications and it has recently issued licenses to five applicants to kick-start the journey of digital banking.

The Government has enhanced the quantum of additional taxation applicable on banks that have low ADR. The ADR of Bank Alfalah remains comfortably above the threshold, however banks with low ADR would continue to focus on cautious advances growth or modest balance sheet growth to avoid higher tax incidence. Meanwhile, in time, implementation of IFRS-9 will shift the industry’s approach towards risk-based pricing for loans.

During the year, SBP remained aggressive and further increased key policy rate by 625bps in CY22 to 16.0% amid persistent global and domestic supply shocks, PKR weakness and falling reserves. However, despite the attractive saving rates, banking sector deposits adopted a modest pace in 2022, rising 6% YoY, in line with M2 growth.

Success of the IMF program will determine economic conditions and will be pivotal in framing the outlook. Additionally, 2023 being an election year, with structured reforms and expected resolution of IMF standoff, the banking sector is likely to remain robust and resilient.

| Basic and Diluted earnings per share – Rupees | 10.27  | 8.00   |

Bank Alfalah kept its growth trajectory. The bank posted profit after taxation growth of 28.1% from last year; which stood at Rs. 18.206 billion as compared to Rs. 14.217 billion last year. This translates into earnings per share (EPS) of Rs. 10.27 (2021: Rs. 8.00). The growth in profit before tax of 54.7% helped absorb the impact of one-time super tax imposed by the Federal Government.

Revenue increased by 58.5% year-on-year (YoY) and stands at Rs. 99.126 billion as compared to Rs. 62.522 billion last year. Markup income grew significantly by 67.2%. Well positioned ALM book along with strong earning assets growth led to this growth. Non-markup income stood at Rs. 21.786 billion, higher by 34.0% from SPLY; growth was visible in all non-fund-based income lines with exception of capital gains due to rapid increase in the discount rates by the central bank to curb inflation and one-off gain last year. FX income increased on back of better trade and remittance flows and higher market volatility. Dividend income doubled due to better corporate earnings and positioning in high yielding dividend stocks.

The exceptional efforts of the network, a diversified product suite and well-executed strategic plan resulted in Bank Alfalah achieving an impressive deposit growth of 30.5% in 2022. The bank’s deposits closed the year at Rs. 1.487 trillion. The increase is mainly due to the strong growth of 32.1% in current accounts, which stood at Rs. 661.365 billion as at Dec 31, 2022. CA mix closed at 44.5%.

The bank grew loans by 9.5% YoY, while maintaining.

34   BANK ALFALAH



credit discipline. The growth is reﬂective of the Bank’s strategy to focus on consumer ﬁnance, SME lending and penetration in digital lending space. Despite challenging market fundamentals, the bank’s credit performance was quite strong during the current year. As at the year end, our gross advances to deposits ratio (ADR) stood at 51.5%, higher than 50% on which higher income tax rate becomes applicable. Our underwriting discipline and rigorous client selection continued to serve us well which reﬂects in our non-performing loans ratio which stood at 4.0%. This is despite some prudent classiﬁcations. Further non-performing loans remain fully covered with coverage being 107.6%. Moreover, the bank, in light of uncertain economic conditions has taken a general provision against the high-risk and ﬂood impacted credit portfolio, which is showing higher economic vulnerability. This portfolio excludes GoP backed exposures, staff loans, loans secured against liquid collaterals.

# Capital Structure of the Bank

The Bank remained well-capitalised with a capital base well above regulatory benchmarks and Basel capital requirements. It continues with a policy of sufﬁcient proﬁt retention to increase its risk absorption capacity. The Bank’s total Capital Adequacy Ratio is 13.83% against the requirement of 11.50% (including Capital Conservation Buffer of 1.50% of the total Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). Quality of the capital is evident from the Bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio, which comes to 9.51% against the regulatory requirement of 7.50% (including CCB of 1.5%). Detailed disclosures on CAR and Risk Management are given in notes 44 & 45 respectively, in the annexed unconsolidated ﬁnancial statements.

# Business Performance Review

Business development, performance and position of the Bank, and its impact on the environment are discussed in detail in Organisational Review, Outlook, Performance and Position sections of this Annual Report.

# Government of Pakistan (GoP) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) policies and their impact on the Bank’s business performance

In line with the Government’s vision to achieve growth in construction and export, and to improve the business environment for local manufacturers, SBP continued with its enabling role towards Government policies for economic development and effective resource utilization. As focus remained on promoting ﬁnancial inclusion, ﬁnancial development and documentation of financial transactions, SBP, with the support of local banks and DFIs, has launched various schemes. Bank Alfalah consistently demonstrated its dedication towards achieving these developmental goals and has been recognized time and again for its remarkable performance and contribution to economic growth.

# 1. Digitisation for ﬁnancial inclusion

Focus on digital ﬁnancial solutions is of great significance to ﬁnancial inclusion. As digital channels can increase the outreach of the ﬁnancial sectors more effectively and economically, the SBP has initiated plans on many fronts, including licensing of digital banks, RAAST, Asaan Mobile Account etc.

# a. Digital Products

As a thought leader in the industry, we accelerated our efforts to enhance digital banking offerings, and to develop innovative ways to connect with customers, while continuing to prioritise our customer-centric approach. We continue to innovate and invest in our digital capabilities to complement our strong branch network, enabling our customers to bank how and where they want. Our strategy is aligned with SBP objectives to promote ﬁnancial inclusion; provide credit access to unserved and underserved; and to provide affordable/cost effective digital ﬁnancial services.

# b. RAAST

SBP launched Pakistan’s ﬁrst instant payment system Raast, to provide instant, reliable and zero-cost digital payment services in Pakistan. Raast is an end-to-end digital payments solution and is targeted to be used to settle small-value retail payments of individuals and small businesses in real time. In the ﬁrst phase, bulk payment module was launched in early 2021 while in the second phase, P2P (person to person) payments were initiated in early 2022. Users can now transfer funds using their bank's mobile application, internet banking or over-the-counter services without paying any transaction cost. Bank Alfalah has been very active in promoting this new payment gateway. As a result, more than half a million bank customers have been linked to Raast, channeling 2.7 mn transactions valuing PKR 198 bn during 2022.



DIRECTORS’ REPORT

# 2. Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy

During the year, the Bank, in line with SBP’s vision continued to take measures to improve financial inclusion and financial literacy. To this end, the Bank launched Banking on Equality and implemented Customers’ Digital Onboarding Framework.

# a. Banking on Equality

Diversity & Inclusion has been an important initiative in our culture change journey. The State Bank of Pakistan’s Banking on Equality introduced in the year 2022 has enabled our robust Diversity & Inclusion strategy and helped us align our initiatives with the guidelines provided. Our initiatives designed to drive diversity ratio, sensitization of workplace, financial inclusion of women and specially abled customers, learning and development of women and many others have had a positive impact on the business. Increasing number of accounts and other products and services for women have helped financial inclusion and empowerment. Further, learning & development has facilitated women branch managers in outperforming their male counterparts. Sensitization has helped in creating a conducive environment at BAFL and many other initiatives have helped us in attracting and motivating women to take up careers at Bank Alfalah. The Global Diversity and Inclusion Benchmark forum has also awarded us for exceeding their set benchmarks in ten categories in 2022.

# b. Digital Onboarding

Bank Alfalah reimagined customer experience right at the point of origination, going through successive iterations from rationalization of paper-based application forms to tablet-based banking and culminating at a fully digitized, self-initiated customer digital onboarding experience. We are the pioneers in introducing digital onboarding and were given exclusive pilot approval by the regulator. The sophistication and capabilities acquired during the innovation process were greatly applied towards both segments of our target markets i.e. Resident Pakistanis (residing in Pakistan) as well as Non-resident Pakistanis (living abroad) for a fully digital onboarding process. Bank Alfalah RAPID, through its universal set of products and services catering to the financial needs of all strata of society, will go a long way towards digitalizing financial services and improving financial inclusion and access to finance.

# 3. Roshan Digital Account (RDA)

RDA is the SBP flagship program to bring banking solutions to Non-Resident Pakistanis (NRPs), which has also been helping the country in terms of remittance inflows. Under the scheme, SBP has built many much-needed products around RDA including i) Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPCs), ii) Roshan Apni Car (RAC), iii) Roshan Apna Ghar (RAG), iv) Roshan Samaaji Khidmat (RSK), and v) Roshan Equity Investments. Through the RDA channel, NRPs can digitally open/operate FCY/LCY accounts through internet banking and mobile apps without lengthy documentation gaining access to a savings tool providing attractive returns through NPCs. Bank Alfalah successfully opened more than 43 thousand RDAs since inception till Dec 31, 2022. Total investment made in Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPCs) through Bank Alfalah amounted to PKR 62.1 bn since inception, till Dec 31, 2022.

# 4. SME Asaan Finance (SAAF) Scheme

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contribute about 40% of Pakistan’s GDP and remain critical to economic development. In this regard, SBP, in collaboration with Govt. of Pakistan, launched SAAF which is a refinance and credit guarantee facility for creditworthy SMEs facing challenges in accessing funding. Its features include: i) option for Shariah-compliant products, ii) facility for Working Capital and Term Loans, and iii) acceptance of personal guarantees. By Jun 30, 2022, total lending under the scheme reached PKR 13.8 bn. Bank Alfalah, being already active in this segment and helping towards the ultimate Government goal of economic development, remained at the forefront. During 2022, the Bank processed around 1,700 loan applications and disbursed more than PKR 3.0 bn.

# 5. Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG)

With forward and backward linkages to various industries, revival of construction and housing is of great significance. A mark-up subsidy facility was announced by the Government in 2021 for the middle-income segment to buy/construct their first house. Until Jun 30, 2022, total loans approved reached PKR 236 bn while disbursement stood at PKR 100 bn at the industry level. Bank Alfalah has disbursed more than PKR 7.0 bn under this scheme in 2022.

# 6. Refinance Facilities

In order to ensure adequate supply of financing to industries, especially export-oriented industries, SBP launched various schemes to meet business growth needs. Major schemes include Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) under which the Bank has disbursed around PKR 19.0 bn during 2022, and LTFF for export-oriented sector under which the Bank has disbursed around PKR 7.0 bn during 2022.

# The Group’s Performance

Bank Alfalah posted consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs. 18.397 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: Rs. 14.460 billion). Earnings per share (EPS) attributable to equity holders of the Bank was measured at Rs. 10.38 in comparison to Rs. 8.12 for the last year. The key contributor to the increase in the consolidated profit is the share of profit from associates amounting to Rs. 669.831 million (pre-tax).

The Bank has 62.50% shareholding in Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited, which is engaged in the business of stock brokerage, investment banking, corporate finance and fund placements. Further, the Bank has associated entities with equity investment of 30% in Alfalah Insurance Limited, 30% in Sapphire Wind Power Limited and 40.2% in Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited.

# Performance of Subsidiary:

Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited incurred an operating loss of Rs. 11.741 million as compared to an operating profit of Rs. 74.075 million for the last year mainly because of significant reduction in the trading values at PSX which affected the entire industry. On the contrary, Alfalah CLSA managed to increase its revenue through an aggressive retail expansion strategy and addition of new business segments. This business expansion resulted in an increase in financing cost and administrative expenses offsetting brokerage, advisory and bank profits. Accordingly, earning per share (EPS) for the year declined to Rs. 0.19 as compared to Rs. 1.53 last year.

For the upcoming year, the company expects economic growth to continue, albeit, at a slower pace. Market volumes are expected to remain at a lower level due to impaired macroeconomic factors; while a slight upward revision in interest rates during the year may slow the pace of growth in the benchmark index.

# DIRECTORS’ REPORT

# Dividend, Bonus Shares And Other Appropriations

# Uncertainties that could affect the Bank’s resources, revenues and operations

All projections are, by nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, some beyond control. Factors that may potentially affect the Bank’s resources, revenues and operations are:

- Global macroeconomic conditions impacting overall economic activity;
- Impact of climate conditions on economic activity and business operations;
- Geopolitical risks and uncertainties across the geographies that we operate in;
- Global AML/CFT compliance in accordance with FATF;
- Trade policies of trade partner countries;
- Economic decisions on discount rate/monetary policy;
- Disciplined fiscal policy and corporate taxation measures;
- Law and order situation/political environment within the country;
- Local government rules and regulations;
- Emergence of disruptive technologies; and
- Risk of cyberattacks.

The Bank’s Risk Management Group regularly performs stress tests against various pre-determined scenarios to analyse the impact of any potential losses and to determine whether the Bank has enough capital to withstand the impact of adverse developments. The results of such tests have showed that the Bank has adequate capital, liquidity and profitability to bear any losses.

The Bank proactively monitors these uncertainties and risks, whilst ensuring that corrective and protective measures are undertaken to maintain operating performance and protect shareholder interests. A detailed overview is given in the ‘Outlook’ and ‘Strategy’ sections of this Annual Report.

# Subsequent Events

There are no significant post balance sheet events that could materially affect the company’s performance as presented in these financials or could have required a disclosure of facts.

# Acknowledgement

On behalf of the Board, we would like to thank the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and other regulatory authorities for their continuous guidance and support. At the same time, we would like to express our gratitude to our shareholders, our customers and business partners for their continued patronage.

Over the years, we have laid the foundations to deliver great value and service to our customers, while improving profitability and strengthening our balance sheet. We will remain focused on serving our customers and playing a key role in supporting economic recovery. In doing this, we will be mindful of our responsibilities to our staff and communities, and of continuing to deliver high returns to our shareholders.

# Stakeholders’ Engagement

# Customers

# Customer Experience and Complaint Management

The Customer Experience Unit functions as the center point for promoting customer interests and serves the customer-centric agenda of the Bank which majorly revolves around the following:

- the Bank’s conduct with customers
- improving our service levels
- pushing service innovation
- understanding the customer via consistent research
- service culture evolution within the Bank

Specifically, the Customer Experience unit works on the following to promote customer centric culture.

- Consumer Protection Policy - Bank Alfalah has a comprehensive consumer protection policy that encompasses broad guidelines to manage customers throughout their journey with the Bank, ranging from product development, sales practices, marketing activities, communication protocols, and handling of customers. Further, through the Live Service Monitoring Program, real-time remediation is driven at the branches by taking corrective measures on aspects that can be dealt with immediately.
- Promoting a Service-Oriented Culture (in collaboration with HR) - Customer Experience and HR together have undertaken long running initiatives in order to inculcate and promote a customer centric and service oriented culture at Bank Alfalah. Through the introduction of the “At Your Service” program, the aim is to create a welcoming environment for the customers and to serve them right and on time through six basic behaviors that we can mindfully adapt. Through the Digital Soft Skills training, we are trying to train the employees on handling different kinds of customers through situation based learning. Furthermore, Customer Experience designs and runs internal campaigns to drive awareness on various attributes of serving the customers – e.g. ABC of Business Etiquettes which talks about the appearance, behavior, and communication of the employees with the customers; Workplace Ethics campaign was directed towards greeting culture, body language, soft skills, and data privacy awareness; Customer Diversification was directed towards:
- Customer service quality level
- Areas for process improvement
- Avenues for digitisation and innovation
- Knowledge Initiatives - Customer Experience drives a robust knowledge enhancement program focused towards increasing our staff awareness levels regarding not only products, processes, and services, but also soft skills and interaction basics at the branch level. To promote and embed customer-centricity, not only do we take the contemporary approach, we also use media such as service snippets, infographics, and online portals. We have a Knowledge Portal, a one-stop-shop for all product knowledge available with the click of a button through our portal in order to make the consultation experience for the frontline staff and the customers easier, more accurate and quicker.
- Customer Insights - Customer Insights focuses on enabling and generating feedback from customers on various journeys and touchpoints within the bank. These could include surveys based on satisfaction with products and processes or feedback on strategic aspects of service. Currently, these surveys are conducted through different manual and digital means (SMS and ROBO Calls) which allows us to reach out to a wider audience through the most effective tool. From conducting ~20,000 surveys in a year, this tool has helped reach more than 200,000 customers in 2022. Further, in 2022, we initiated the Voice of Employee Program pilot through pushing SMS Surveys to our employees and getting their feedback on the support they internally receive from the stakeholders.

# Attrition Management Unit

In 2022, a new unit was set-up as a pilot based on the product cancellation analysis done. This was to generate insights on the reasons around why the customers are closing their bank accounts with us or are cancelling other products. Through this, the unit tried to retain the customer or to forward their concerns to be addressed to relevant stakeholders for higher customer retention and stronger relationship management.

# Process Optimisation

The Bank keeps a close eye on complaints, processes and channels to identify gaps and opportunities in order to increase operational efficiency and drive improvement across the organisation. This sub-unit creates synergies across the Bank to drive innovation and change in order to provide an enhanced experience and optimise the customers’ journey. One of the major projects this year was to establish an Incidents Management mechanism at the Bank. Through this, any incidents that can potentially have a mass impact on the customer complaints, contact center service levels, or the customer satisfaction are identified and are reported for the bank to proactively remediate. Another innovation this year was to develop the Branch Experience (BEX) mobile application which allows the branches to self-assess on service aspects. Furthermore, this helps anyone conducting a branch visit (ranging from the Senior Management to the officers) to log their feedback immediately.

# Complaint Management Unit

This Unit ensures diligent complaint closures, while maintaining high Fair Treatment of Customers standards. In 2022, we directly received a total of 68,032 complaints against 91,217 complaints last year, which were successfully resolved. Additionally, the Bank conducts thorough root-cause analyses to facilitate and drive continuous improvement in collaboration with the business and product management teams via various channels.

| Number of complaints | 2022   | 2021   |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
|                      | 68,032 | 91,217 |

All initiatives we propose are a product of the feedback received from our employees, and as a result have a direct impact on the business, behavioural aspects, and customer loyalty. Our devised strategy has been inculcated into the Bank’s overarching 5 year strategy, evidencing our senior management’s commitment and zeal towards ensuring a positive Culture for our employees.

# Video Mystery Shopping Programme

Bank Alfalah regularly conducts a Video Mystery Shopping Program to gauge the interaction experience and other service impacting attributes like the ambiance, ATM experience, security experience etc. In 2022, we conducted this research twice with a 100% network coverage of Branches, Premier Lounges, and Consumer Finance Service Centers in order to build momentum before commissioning the study in 2023.

# Learning and Development

“Opportunity to Learn and Grow” is one of the main pillars of the Bank’s People Happiness Charter. Our aim is to invest in employee development and training opportunities so that our employees continue to hone their skills and advance their careers. Specific focus is placed on job role enrichment, upskilling employees and professional development to enhance the skillset of our workforce.

Strengthening the employee induction programs is another focus area to ensure smooth transition of new joiners by equipping them with knowledge about Code of Conduct, Culture, Systems, Policies & Compliance. The bank hosts two programs by the name of Start Right – for all new joiners, and Ready to Perform – for front line employees.

2022 remained an exceptional year for learning and development. The year witnessed digital transformation of learning methodologies, revamping our physical learning spaces. From virtual infrastructure up-gradation to extending innovative learning opportunities, the Learning Division made concerted efforts to equip employees with the best skill-set, enabling them to discover new and better ways to serve our customers.

In line with Employee Happiness Charter to extend opportunities to learn and grow, learning interventions were offered virtually as well as in person. Training interventions and e-Learning modules were offered in various disciplines. Leadership trainings were organized for the executives. Knowledge sessions were organised for various businesses including special focus on SBP initiatives.

Further, in order to induct young talent at Bank Alfalah,



# STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIP & ENGAGEMENT

A customised batch learning program was organised for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Management Trainees. We will continue to inculcate learning solutions for our people to enhance their personal and professional skills and nurture a learning culture for organisational growth. In line with the Employee Happiness Charter, we will be heavily investing in enhancing the Customer Happiness Journey by upskilling our employees on Service Quality Management.

The organization’s focus on Culture & Inclusion is evident from the fact that ‘Culture’ has been placed as a central pillar of Bank Alfalah’s 5-year strategy demonstrating our senior leadership’s commitment to improving diversity. Bank Alfalah believes in diversity of ideas and highly encourages employees to do things differently which is an integral part of the organization’s vision and mission. Our Values are well defined by allotting behaviors and competencies to our employees providing a holistic understanding to them. This facilitates an alignment to our Values leading to a positive Culture and a workplace that has a conducive environment for everyone, irrespective of their diversities.

We believe that DE&I inspires creativity and innovation, unlocks productivity, and enhances profitability. Our D&I strategy rests on the following four pillars:

Developing gender intelligent leadersIntroducing and monitoring diversity indicatorsCreating measures to facilitate work-life balance and conducive work cultureHelping women succeed and nurturing their ambition

The bank‘s commitment to build a diverse workforce and an inclusive work culture where everyone is valued, led us to win the following awards and accolades in 2022:

In Pakistan, GDIB Awards are conducted by HR Metrics to recognise organisations’ commitment towards DE&I.

We are humbled to receive these awards, and we will continue to advance our journey of becoming one of the most diverse and inclusive employers of Pakistan.

# a) Childcare Allowance

In pursuit of becoming a family-friendly organisation, Bank Alfalah provides childcare allowance to its women employees and single parents. This initiative fulfills our commitment to working mothers/single parents as it helps them arrange day-care/care taker facilities, while setting their sights on their careers.

# b) Maternity and Paternity Leave

We understand that both mothers and fathers have unique roles to play as parents, especially during the first few days with a newborn. Our women employees are eligible for a 6-month long maternity leave, while our male employees can avail 7-day paternity leave.

# c) Maternity Cover Incentive

We have launched a Maternity Cover policy to ensure continuity of work while a woman is away on maternity leave. We offer our employees the opportunity to serve as ‘Maternity Cover’ for 6 months to take over work of the employees going away on maternity leave. The employee serving as Maternity Cover gets a special monetary incentive at the end of 6 months. Serving as the Maternity Cover offers development opportunities for employees as it diversifies their experience and gives them the chance to learn new skills.

# d) Iddat Leave

This is a unique type of leave that Bank Alfalah is offering across all industries. We offer a fully paid 130-day long Iddat Leave for our women employees in the unfortunate event of their spouse’s death or divorce so they may have job security and peace of mind during their grieving time.

# e) Flexible Working Hours

Bank Alfalah aims to create an environment where the value of flexible working hours is understood and managers are receptive to the needs of their teams. This policy reinforces a culture of meritocracy through focus on outcomes rather than location or hours worked.

# f) Communication Channel for Women

Bank Alfalah has a channel specifically dedicated to women through which the Bank regularly stays in touch.

engaged with its employees by sharing articles, counseling services, and reinforcing policies on how to handle harassment. This interactive approach helps create a more conducive work environment for them. They can reach us through email and phone at any time so that we remain accessible to them, hear them out, and support them if they are facing any issue regarding work environment, work-life balance and growth opportunities.

# g) Employee Volunteering Leave

Bank Alfalah offer leave of upto 2 working days during which employees can donate their time and talents to the communities around them.

# h) Celebrating International Women’s Day

In 2022, we celebrated the entire month of March as the month of happiness for women during which we:

- Sent out celebratory chocolates to all women at Bank Alfalah
- Rolled out communications to emphasize on the benefits for women
- Re-launched e-learnings for gender stereotypes
- Launched a logo for Diversity and Inclusion

Conducted high impact meet and greet engagement sessions in Karachi and Lahore covering over 70% women bank-wide. We engaged the masses and created awareness on the DE&I agenda, culture, values and efforts Bank Alfalah is making to create a conducive environment for women in specific.

# i) SheLEAD (Bank Alfalah’s Signature Leadership Development Programme for Women)

Developing women to prepare them for leadership roles is at the heart of the Bank’s D&I agenda. We have designed and launched SheLEAD as our in-house signature leadership development programme for women, which enables women to drive their careers forward, overcome self-limiting beliefs, and build strategic networks. It uses discussions, self-reflection activities and videos as training methodologies programs.

# j) Sponsorship Programme for Women

We have launched the Sponsorship Programme to provide our women employees the support and direction they need to advance their careers. Sponsorship, often confused with mentorship, is different from the latter in the sense that while mentors share advice and guidance with their mentees, sponsors advocate for their protégés, are personally interested in their upward movement, and highlight their achievements. Our senior management served as mentors, while women in mid-level leadership are given an opportunity to apply for this program as protégés. Sponsors and protégés are paired up for a 6-month long sponsorship relationship during which the sponsors are expected to not just share career advice and guidance with women, but also champion their visibility in the Bank and highlight their achievements.

# • Celebration of Festivals of the Minority Groups

Bank Alfalah rolled out communication and personalised messages from Head HRLG to celebrate festivals of minority groups so they may feel welcome and included. Some of these festivals include Holi, Diwali, Easter, and Nowruz.

# • Disability Inclusion

We conducted sensitization sessions for line managers of employees with disabilities to ensure that they are treated fairly, and are offered equal opportunities to learn and succeed. Moreover, we have signed an MoU with ConnectHear to facilitate our deaf and mute employees.

Additionally, in line with State Bank of Pakistan’s requirements, we formulated a policy for differently-abled individuals by hosting a focus group with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that we are a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce. The policy focuses on providing equal employment opportunities and an inclusive infrastructural work environment for differently-abled individuals, while sensitizing our current employees’ mindsets. The policy was approved by the Board of Directors following which an entire strategy along with the initiatives was decided as the way forward.

# • Breast Cancer Awareness

Every year in October, we run a breast cancer awareness campaign in order to destigmatize this taboo topic and raise awareness about its risk factors and early detection methods. In our internal communications to employees, we shared facts, myths vs. facts, what symptoms women should not ignore, what to do when women are experiencing symptoms and who is recommended breast cancer screenings and self-exams in partnership with Shaukat Khanum. Furthermore, Bank Alfalah’s head office was decorated with pink lights and pink masks and ribbons were distributed bank-wide to raise awareness.

STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIP & ENGAGEMENT

# Analysts and Credit Rating Agencies

Credit rating agencies provide value for investors and market participants by rating the creditworthiness and ability of the Bank to repay its credit and debt obligations. By providing a rating, credit rating agencies put different entities on an equal footing, providing a comparable rating for different types of entities and different types of bonds. A credit rating takes into account many factors, including the financial health of the entity, cash flows, lien priority, entity governance, past history of debt repayment, bond term, and future economic outlook relevant to the entity.

The Bank engages with PACRA for entity and instruments ratings. The credit rating is updated on an annual basis and the rating report is submitted to the State Bank of Pakistan and made public within seven days of the notification of rating by the credit rating agency. Furthermore, the Bank discloses its credit rating prominently in its published annual and quarterly financial statements.

# Media

The media is instrumental in communicating the Bank’s vision, mission and core beliefs in order to inform and educate customers and potential customers. The Bank utilises conventional and digital media to reach its audience. Whether its television and print or the increasingly popular social media, the Bank aspires to expand its footprint, establish its brand, and inform and update its customers regarding its initiatives and tailor-made offerings. Without the press, the Bank would not be able to develop a relationship of trust with its stakeholders.

The Bank fully uses the power of media to keep all its stakeholders informed and aware of its performance. The role of the media is immense in the spread of information pertaining to the Bank, whether it’s information on financial literacy, green banking, digitisation, DE&I initiatives, regulations, advertisements or promotions. The Bank strives to maintain frequent and open communication with the media at all times to create brand awareness and strengthen its brand image.

# Regulatory Bodies

Bank Alfalah assigns high importance to compliance with laws and regulations by implementing the same at all levels of the Bank in true letter and spirit. Promoting high standards of integrity and ethics, the Bank has developed and enforced a robust compliance model with three lines of defense across the organisation for ensuring effective management of compliance risks.

Furthermore, the Bank considers regulatory compliance and reporting a key responsibility, among other compliance requirements, which is carried out by the Bank appropriately as prescribed by various regulatory bodies. We believe in being fair and open in all our reporting to and dealings with the regulators with a vision to maintain a transparent relationship with regulatory bodies.

# Society

Bank Alfalah considers contributing to society a prime responsibility of the Bank as a responsible corporate citizen. As a prominent and responsible entity operating in the country, the Bank continually looks for opportunities to give back to society. The Bank believes in developing the community in a sustainable way forward.

The Bank contributes to society through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, whereby it undertakes various activities to benefit society at large. This is done through multiple initiatives such as ration distribution and donations to communities in need, plantation drives to aid the environment, financial grants to enable quality education, medical treatment for the underprivileged, infrastructural developments, and interactive sessions aimed at personal development.

Please refer to the Sustainability section of this Annual Report for details on the engagement with community/society.

# Methods and Assumptions used in Compiling Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key Performance Indicators are the metrics utilised by the Management to measure performance against strategic objectives. KPIs are designed carefully keeping in view quantitative and qualitative aspects.

- Quantitative aspects relate to the Bank’s financial base, ability to generate funds, deployment of funds in the most profitable avenues, profitability, market share, growth in share price, value addition over the book price of shares, adequacy of capital, and liquidity.
- Qualitative aspects relate to customer and investor confidence, brand identity and loyalty, innovation, employee confidence, data security, strategic partnerships, and risk management.

KPIs are continually reviewed and worked upon by the Management of the Bank. They are analysed, correlated with the external environment, and aligned with factors affecting the Bank’s strategies and performance. They are visibly communicated and followed, in line with the strategy of the Bank.

# Methods in Compiling Indicators

# Quantitative KPIs

- Market share: The Bank focuses on gaining market share in deposits, advances, trade, remittances and government initiatives such as RDA. Our growing share reflects the trust of our customers in the Bank and is an indication of customers’ preference to choose Bank Alfalah as the preferred transaction bank. The Bank constantly assesses this indicator through a comparative analysis of the volumes of peers, in order to grow and decide on various growth strategies.
- Share price and value addition over the book value of the share: This is a measure of shareholders’ and investors’ confidence in the Bank’s performance. The Bank monitors this KPI closely and aligns its financial performance to build momentum in investor confidence.

- Profitability: The main elements of profitability, markup income and non-fund based revenue, are derived from effective balance sheet management, high earning assets and a sound deposit level. Furthermore, while the costs of doing business due to investment in IT & Digital infrastructures may go up, the Bank willingly incurs such costs without compromising on profitable ventures. The Bank controls and manages the costs of driving sound profitability and evaluates its profitability levels (Earnings Per Share) in order to maximize shareholder return and ensure sustainable returns.

- Dividend payouts: Sustainable dividends are at the forefront of the Bank’s strategy with a view of maximizing shareholders’ long-term returns. The Bank will continue to prioritize a consistent and healthy dividend payout over the coming years.

- Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios: Maintaining capital well above the regulatory capital adequacy limits (including buffers) and strong liquidity ratios indicate the Bank’s sound financial footing. These are calculated based on various regulatory instructions. The Bank keeps a check and balance on these ratios and does not deviate from regulatory requirements.

- Ability to generate funds: The Bank had successfully generated funds through a Medium Term Note and multiple ADT-1 instruments. These reflect institutional investors’ confidence in the soundness of the Bank’s balance sheet, efficient liquidity management, and our ability to repay debts.

# Qualitative KPIs

These are closely linked with the above quantitative aspects. Hence, the outcomes of these quantitative KPIs have a strong correlation with qualitative KPIs. The Bank continually invests its capital in a manner that ensures that we simultaneously continue to achieve and exceed set qualitative indicators. Given below are some qualitative KPIs, which the management tracks:

- Quality service: We do this by driving society towards digital innovation. The increased usage of our digital avenues such as Alfa app, QR Payments, Alfa Payment Gateway, CDMs, ATMs/KIOSK, and POS machines represent the quality of service that we have delivered to our customers. Further, the Bank’s dedicated Customer Experience unit measures and manages performance quality through various service parameters across the Bank.
- Customer satisfaction: The Bank has conducted various customer surveys to collect direct feedback and has improved its customer satisfaction level over the period of time. The methods used are Digital Survey Platform (calls and SMS) and Customer Experience Management (monitoring quality of service at customer touch points).
- Employee happiness: The Bank strives to enhance employee happiness since it has an important bearing on customer service and performance-oriented results. The bank has made employee happiness a core element of its culture. This is evident from the Bank’s regular practice of following a People Happiness Framework and monitoring happiness scores based on annual feedback from all employees.

Risk Management Division of the Bank devises risk appetite every year which is then approved by the Board considering the Business plans and macro economic environment. The Bank’s RA for 2022 was established considering historical trend, regulatory requirements, stress test results and senior management’s views about economic situations versus the business objectives. Application of the RA and its monitoring helps to ensure the Bank stays within appropriate risk boundaries.

# Functions of Risk Appetite:

- Policies, Procedures, Manuals and SOPs: The Bank has well established policies and other documentary guidelines for every product and process. These serve as guidelines and monitoring tools for the staff performing various risk related activities. All relevant departments are responsible for ensuring compliance with documents.

# RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES

The Risk Assessment has been done for the following:

- Business model: Potential risks facing the Bank’s business model which in turn affect the survival of the Bank. Sound business growth with managed risk is crucial for operations. The Bank considers expected level of profitability, market reputation, experienced personnel, logistic support, etc for business model. Relevant risks can be credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, reputational risk and concentration risk.
- Future performance: Technological obsolescence and inability to cope with recent technological developments can also threaten the existence. Further, the situations of the country/region where the Bank operates also cause impacts and is a necessary factor for consideration in risk assessment. The Bank considers reputation, ability to meet stakeholders expectations, capital adequacy, macro and microeconomic scenarios, risk management practices for its future performance. Relevant risks could be information security risk, environmental risk and legal risk.
- Liquidity: The ability to operate with sufficient funds to meet depositors obligations is key to operating as a bank. Further, this also includes fulfilling regulatory requirements set by the regulator, hence, compliance plays an important role in this regard. The Bank considers fundamentals like maintaining adequate capital, liquidity and operational control at all times in order to safeguard the interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders and other stakeholders and meet its obligations against these. Relevant risks could be liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and compliance risk.

Other key focus areas are:

- Build a risk culture
- Financial crime and economic vulnerability
- Client risk rating focus
- Regulatory compliance
- Information and Cyber Security
- New technologies
- Environment, Social & Governance (ESG)
- Business resilience

The risk management and mitigation strategy is therefore fundamentally based on maintaining adequate capital, liquidity, and operational control at all times in order to safeguard the interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders and other stakeholders.

# Key Risks

| TYPES OF RISKS | LIKELIHOOD | MATERIALITY |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Credit Risk    | High       | High        |

It means the possibility of monetary loss to financial institutions arising due to the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to perform a commitment per the agreed terms and conditions, among other things, on account of lending, trading, hedging, settlement, and other financial transactions.

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Risk Ratings, Stress Testing, limit monitoring, exception monitoring and delinquency ratio.

Mitigation Strategy: The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risk is identified and analysed diligently, ensuring that credit commitments are appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices), and documented. Bank Alfalah has a Credit Operational Manual (COM) and a Credit Policy Manual (CPM) in place to strategise and govern the Bank’s overall lending strategy. Furthermore, the Bank has an internal Credit Initiation and Risk Rating System through which risk levels are assessed based on customers’ risk profiles. Bank Alfalah is also in the process of implementing IFRS-9 to measure and assess changes in credit risk. The timely recognition of and provision for credit losses promote a safe banking system and play an essential role in supervision. Furthermore, the portfolios and well-defined parameters are actively reviewed, and, if required, corrective actions are taken at a nascent stage.

| Credit Concentration Risk | Medium | Medium |

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Limits monitoring including Sectors, Tenors and Risk Weighted Assets.

Mitigation Strategy: The SBP has prescribed regulatory limits for banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Moreover, to restrict industry concentration risk, the Bank’s annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industries. The Bank manages and monitors its portfolio of loan assets and limits for high-risk customers. Limit concentrations are monitored in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity, and large exposure.

| Operational Risk | Medium | Medium |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ |

It is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate internal processes, people and systems, or from external events including legal risks. This excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Mitigation Strategy: Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Bank and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System) for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. We aim to implement a new process based Risk and Control Self-Assessment method across the Bank in order to effectively manage operational risks and continually monitor the effectiveness of defined controls through first-line self-assessment reviews, especially for the processes and activities that may significantly impact the Bank’s risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES

| TYPES OF RISKS | LIKELIHOOD | MATERIALITY |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Market Risk    | High       | High        |

It is the risk arising from changes in the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank due to adverse movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and commodity prices, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. Due to the external nature of the risk, and given the prevalent rising interest rate scenario, the likelihood of adverse price movements is currently high. However, stringent controls are in place to mitigate any material impact on profitability and capital. This risk includes Interest rate risk, Equity price risk, Foreign Exchange risk and Commodity risk.

Impact: Financial

Capital Affected: Financial Capital

Assessment tools: Investment Limits, Exposure Limits and Sensitivity Analysis, tolerance Limits, Duration & PV 01 limits

Mitigation Strategy: The Market and Liquidity Risk Unit monitors the impact of price and rate movements on the Bank’s portfolios and periodically reports to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee (IC), which are primarily responsible for oversight of market risk. The Bank has developed various tools for risk measurement and its mitigation thereof, including Value at Risk (VaR), Duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) and Re-pricing Gaps. In addition, the Bank carries out stress tests, using both internally developed scenarios and scenarios prescribed by the regulator. Moreover, the Bank has a comprehensive risk control limit framework, which defines exposure limits (for each portfolio, issuer, tenor, rating and sector), PVBP limits, money market gap limits, FX gap limits, currency-wise NOP limits, stop loss limits, tolerance limits, counterparty limits, dealer limits, and broker limits. The Bank uses a standardized approach to calculate market risk capital charge under the Basel framework.

Assessment tools: Stress Testing, Advances to Deposits Ratio, Stable Funding Ratio, Statutory Liquidity Reserve Ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Liquid Assets to Liquid Liability ratio and Maturity Gaps.

Mitigation Strategy: The Market and Liquidity Risk Unit performs independent monitoring and reporting of the overall liquidity position in line with regulatory requirements and the Bank’s own risk appetite at the Bank and operations level. The Bank is fully compliant with Basel III liquidity standards, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), with a considerable cushion over the regulatory requirement. Stress Tests are performed (both SBP and internal for all operations and at the Bank level) under which liquidity risk factors are given major shocks to check the vulnerability of the Bank’s balance sheet to those hypothetical shocks in various stress scenarios.

| Model Risk | Medium | High |

# Key Opportunities and Initiatives

| TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES        | LIKELIHOOD | MATERIALITY    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Opportunities in Home Finance | High       | Medium to High |

Pakistan is one of the most difficult countries in the world to get a home loan. Relatively few banks offer and actively market mortgages, and those that do often have onerous rules. That, combined with a reluctance among many Pakistanis to borrow from banks, means that mortgage lending is just minimal percent of gross domestic product. That is slowly starting to change. Pakistan’s government launched an ambitious push to build 5 million affordable homes and relaxed some rules governing mortgages, making it easier for low-income families to secure home loans.

# Financial Obligations

The Bank has fulfilled all its financial obligations and has made timely repayments of its debt/borrowing during the year.

# Strong Capital Base

The Bank is adequately capitalised to overcome liquidity problem, repay debts and meet operational losses, if any. The Bank’s capital adequacy ratio as of 31st December, 2022 was 13.83%, which is higher than the minimum capital ratio of 11.5% required by the Central Bank, and is adequate to meet future business requirements. This CAR is as a result of efficient balance sheet management and operational effectiveness.

The Bank has disclosed its Capital Adequacy Ratio and other liquidity ratios (Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio) in note 44 of unconsolidated financial statements. The note contains regulatory requirement as well as the Bank’s actual position.

Further, the Bank has given detailed Basel disclosure on its website. Refer https://www.bankalfalah.com/financial-reports. Also, refer to note 45 of the unconsolidated financial statements for all Risk Management Disclosures.

# Liquidity Management and Contingency Plan

We manage and control our liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is primarily responsible for the formulation and oversight of our liquidity management strategy. Under the framework, we closely watch the liquidity position for all jurisdictions and at a consolidated level through the monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, which ensures efficient and timely decision-making.

The Bank’s overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversity and stability, and includes our equity and deposits. We have in place a set of liquidity ratios such as Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for all operations, currencies, and at a consolidated level along with maturity gaps, which are monitored on a regular basis for effective management of liquidity. Moreover, we are fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR requirements, which shows our ability to meet our short-term funding needs, and availability of stable funding against our asset portfolio.

A Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is also in place to address liquidity issues in stress scenarios for each operation. The plan covers trigger (systemic and bank specific) action plans along with roles and responsibilities in the event of a liquidity crisis. Treasury prepares CFPs for all operations on an annual basis to identify stress scenarios and funding plans for such situations along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division, and are approved by the ALCO annually.

The Bank has issued a Medium Term Note (MTN) of Rs. 11 Bn in 2020, which has a maturity of three years, and is secured against government securities. PACRA assigned ‘AAA’ (triple A) rating to this MTN. The ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk, a strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments in the long term, and the highest capacity for timely repayment in the short term.

During the year, the Bank issued another tranche of ADT-1 amounting to Rs. 7.0 Bn. The funds so received are aimed at supporting tier one capital of the Bank. Further, the Bank may from time to time consider options for raising capital keeping in view of business needs and regulatory requirements.

The liquidity profile of the Bank is adequate to cater to unforeseen liquidity crises, and any operational losses occurring in the normal course of business. As of 31st December, 2022, our Basel III liquidity ratios, LCR and NSFR, stand at 185% and 150% respectively, well above the regulatory requirement of 100%. Our strong capital base is evident from our ability to withstand any liquidity challenge.

The Bank has adequate plans to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, including long-term debts.

# Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis

The Year – 2022 proved to be quite challenging with respect to macro economic and political environment for the country. The rising political tensions during the first quarter of the outgoing current year created uncertainty in the country that led to the currency crisis and PKR devalued to Rs. 239.37 to US dollar within a span of three to four months. The delay in the restoration of IMF program and dwindling FX reserves further put pressure on the external account and exchange rate as well. The release of IMF installment was a breather for only a month or so but soon negative month on month growth in exports/remittance and with external loan repayments including International Sukuk of USD 1 billion during the first of week of Dec-2022, the SBP reserves dropped to USD 6.714 billion.

Bank Alfalah is working for the relief of flood affectees from the beginning and used the strong network of its branches and front-line staff to help those who were hit by floods. The Bank established Flood Relief Camps and started in-kind donation drives at 32 locations including the Head Office and branches across the country to collect clothes, food items and medicine for the flood-hit communities.

# Commitment to Pakistan

This gesture by the Chairman and Board of Bank Alfalah is unprecedented and is a testament to the strong bond between UAE and Pakistan while reaffirming the strong positioning of Bank Alfalah as being a truly caring bank. His Highness has always been a great supporter of Pakistan and expressed his concerns at the calamity that has recently overwhelmed the country. However, he has also been deeply impressed by the extraordinary fortitude and resilient spirit that characterizes the people of Pakistan as it advances to navigate a way to a safer shore.

# Green Banking Initiatives

Traditionally financial considerations have been the drivers of profit. The severity and accelerated pace of environmental degradation and social deterioration forced a redrawing of priorities for companies on how they should conduct business and for the banks as to what and whom they should finance.

By virtue of their role as intermediaries between people with shortages and surpluses of capital, banks hold a unique position in the economy for sustainable development. This intermediary role is both quantitative and qualitative. We believe that the greatest impact we have on the environment and society is through our financing activities.

Due to their efficient credit approval systems, banks are well-equipped to weigh and the Bank asks customers to rectify negative carbon impact. Green banking integrates financial, social and environmental considerations into decision-making to enable sustained profits and higher returns on investments.

# Areas of Green Banking

Green Banking is divided into the following three areas:

1. Environmental Risk Management, which requires banks to integrate green banking in their credit approval processes and adopt environmental risk management practices, as well as ensure compliance with environmental laws by the borrowers in banks’ credit portfolio.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Bank Alfalah had started the process in early 2015, in collaboration with IFC, to integrate Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) in the credit approval process of the Bank. The ESMS Framework essentially requires that any relevant lending opportunity is to be reviewed and evaluated under the:

- IFC Exclusion List
- Applicable national laws on environment, health, and safety
- IFC Performance Standards

This framework is an integral part of the credit approval process and all relevant credit proposals require credit, environmental and social review prior to approval of the competent authority. The implementation of ESMS framework for clients of low risk sectors is being carried out by our credit professionals provided they clear ESMS module. For sectors of medium and high risk, the Environmental Risk Unit is responsible for identifying, vetting and rating projects from an Environmental and Social Management Risk (ESRM) perspective. All personnel working in this unit have acquired IFC online certification of ’Sustainability Training and E-Learning Program’ (STEP). Additionally, in-house classroom trainings on Environmental and Social.


ANNUAL REPORT 2022 189


# SUSTAINABILITY & CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Management System (ESMS) are conducted for client-dealing Relationship Managers and credit staff. As a result, our borrowers are now aware of the importance of the environment, the need for environmental due diligence, environmental laws, and the role of environmental protection agencies in each province. The bank helps the borrowers to comply with the environmental laws and in case of non-compliance, pushes the customers towards compliance by giving short deferrals and maintain periodic follow-ups with the customers.

During 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. Bank Alfalah is currently aligning its procedures with the afore-mentioned SBP manual.

The cumulative impact of all steps taken so far shows that the Bank has successfully started to achieve the objective of Green Banking as laid down in the SBP Guidelines.

# a) Own Impact Reduction

Own Impact Reduction entails reducing Bank Alfalah’s own carbon footprint. This involves increasing the use of solar energy, which decreases the Bank’s reliance on grid-energy/fossil fuel based energy; reduction in paper consumption; and rationalisation of water consumption.

Achievements in this regard include 150 ATMs converted on solar energy, declining paper consumption, replacement of diesel-fueled generators with UPSs for backup power supply, replacement of regular saver lights with low consumption LEDs, and the replacement of conventional ACs with inverter ACs. The Bank is also continually bringing about resource efficiency and reducing cost by optimal utilisation of all resources.

# b) Green Business Facilitation

Green Business Facilitation, which entails providing finance to businesses (existing and/or fresh customers) willing to invest in operations and technologies bringing improvement in environmental risk management, and resource efficiency. We encourage our clients to improve their operations and technologies by initiating eco-friendly schemes.

We introduced a green financing product ‘Alfalah Green Energy’, which is a term finance facility for customers willing to install solar energy equipment for generation of electricity ranging from 4 KW to 1,000 KW with net metering. It allows repayment tenure of up to 5 years with 3 months’ grace period.

SUSTAINABILITY & CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

# Environment, Social, Governance Initiatives and the Bank’s Contribution

# Background

All three ESG disciplines have distinct set of standards and practices but at a consolidated level, they indicate an organization’s dedication to achieving the greater good for the environment, society and the organisation itself. Shareholders/investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders expect companies to reduce impacts that their businesses have on environment and be more transparent about ESG reporting. ESG program looks at business practices to ensure that the companies actually do what they are required to do. There are important components within each ESG discipline:

| Environmental criteria focuses on the company's impact on the planet. This category includes energy usage, pollution outputs, water management, and other environmental impacts. | The social element of ESG focuses on the way the company treats people. It includes the relationships that organizations have with their workforces, the societies in which they operate, and the current atmosphere including diversity, equity and inclusion; health and safety, labor management, data privacy, and community relations. | The governance aspect refers to a set of organizational practices; controls, and procedures used to make effective decisions, remain compliant, and meet stakeholder demands, including fraud, anti-bribery and corruption, security, financial performance, business ethics, and internal audit; as well as executive leadership and pay. |

Director’s personal interest could possibly conflict with their duty to the Bank. Conflicts may arise in several situations. Typical scenarios are:

- Where the Directors have a direct or indirect material interest in a transaction that the Bank enters into;
- Where the Directors hold positions or offices or possess a property that may result in conflicting duties; and
- Where the Directors stand to benefit from information received by them, or opportunities made available to them in their capacity as Directors or officers.

The Bank exercises particular care in monitoring whether or not it is placed in a position of actual or potential conflicts.

In dealing with conflicts of interest, the Bank pays close attention to the:

- Provision of the Companies Act, 2017 and Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019;
- SBP’s Corporate Governance Regulatory Framework; and
- Article of Associations of the Bank.

# Managing and monitoring conflicts of interest:

- The Directors are well-versed in their responsibilities to act in the best interests of the Bank and investors and to refrain from any conduct that may be considered adverse or contrary to the interests of the Bank and investors;
- The Directors are required to disclose their (along with family members) interests to the Bank before entering into any such transaction as per the manner prescribed in the applicable laws and regulations; The concerned Director, if any, does not participate in any deliberation, decision-making, proceeding, or investigation action by the Board of Directors in case of a conflict of interest.

# Whistleblowing Policies and Procedures

# Overview

In line with the goal of maintaining the highest standards of ethical, moral and legal business conduct, the Bank has established a Whistleblowing Policy to ensure that any concerns raised in relation to unethical practices, corruption and/or fraudulent activities that may cause damage to the Bank’s assets/reputation, are duly addressed.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022 239


# GOVERNANCE

This reinforces focus and commitment to create an environment of trust and transparency, which subsequently nurtures a culture based on honesty and the highest ethical standards.

# Purpose

The core purpose of the Whistleblowing Policy is to provide a safe and secure channel to internal as well as external stakeholders (i.e. our staff or any other person) with genuine suspicions about any wrongdoing/irregularity, to raise concerns/complaints without any fear of reprisal or adverse consequences. The objective of this policy is to encourage everyone to come forward and register concerns through a secure and confidential channel for the redressal of complaints and concerns or for further detection or prevention of any impropriety or malpractice in order to safeguard the interests and reputation of the Bank. It remains an ethical responsibility of all Directors, Senior Management and employees to report violations in accordance with the approved Whistleblowing Policy.

# Scope

The policy encompasses voluntary disclosures by a person about any type of actual or suspected wrongdoings/improprieties at the individual/organisational level, including unethical or fraudulent activities and misconducts that may pose serious threats to the Bank’s operations, financial performance or reputation.

# Process of the Whistleblowing

Any person with the intention to disclose any wrongdoing/impropriety, whether actual or suspected, with reasonable evidence, should report it in writing to the Group Head, Audit and Inspection Group. This can be done either through email at (whistleblowing@bankalfalah.com), surface mail, calling the whistleblower hotline number, or interoffice mail at the official address of CIA/Head of Internal Audit by marking the envelope as ’Confidential‘. Keeping in view the nature, materiality and seriousness of the allegation, CIA/Head of Internal Audit decides whether it requires immediate investigation/audit. All complaints are subject to review by Chairman BAC without any exception.

# Protection for Whistleblower

The identity of the whistleblower is kept most confidential, and it remains the Management’s responsibility to ensure that no harm comes to the whistleblower by virtue of his act of blowing the whistle in good faith.

# Opportunity to shareholders for participation in AGM

Any general meeting called on by the Bank is informed to all shareholders through proper notice in line with regulatory instructions. Further, public awareness message is also sent through newspaper and stock exchange notices. Through this manner, the Bank ensures that each and every shareholder has an opportunity to become aware about the meeting and make for participation in the meeting.

# Number of Instances during the Year and Reporting to Audit Committee

Reported instances are presented through the Group Head, Audit and Inspection, for oversight of the Board Audit Committee (BAC) in BAC meetings. The instructions from BAC, if any are immediately circulated to the concerned departments for enforcement of actions required in real-time. 37 whistles were blown during the year 2022 and details thereof were duly submitted to BAC.




# GOVERNANCE

# Business Resilience (Business Continuity Plan) and Disaster Recovery Planning

To ensure that the Bank’s services are always available to its customers even in crisis, or any other disruptive event, a robust business resilience framework is in place. The Bank’s business resilience team continually works to create a culture that enables adaptability in its business operations amidst any disruptions through proactive planning, maintenance and testing by aligning Business Continuity Management (BCM) of people, spaces, systems, and dependent third parties.

The Board of Directors (BoD) has approved thorough and comprehensively established procedures, whereby the critical business processes at the Bank can be restored in a timely and orderly manner, and can be continued on an interim basis with minimal delay to operations, making sure that all critical business functions continue in the case of a disaster. The Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is intended to be used by the Bank’s resilience teams and all concerned as an action guide in the event of a disruption, providing a pre-planned response to any unforeseen event. BCP is an uninterrupted process, which assures that the Bank remains fortified against all possible threats. Hence, key plans and documents are periodically reviewed and aligned with the changing business environment that the Bank operates in.

The most important and noteworthy aspect of Business Continuity is training and testing of critical functions, allowing relevant teams to stay abreast with roles and responsibilities during emergencies, and to assess effectiveness of their respective departmental recovery plan by testing it within the decided timelines like Recovery Time Object (RTO), Recovery Point Object (RPO) and Maximum Tolerable Down Time (MTD).

# Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The period of time within which the process should be recovered after an outage.

# Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The point in time when the data must be restored in order to perform the process. RPO is the basis on which a data backup strategy is developed.

# Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)

The period of time within which the process should be recovered after an outage.

# Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption

Bank Alfalah has a zero-tolerance policy regarding corruption and bribery. The Bank expects all employees to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, and to comply with all laws, regulations and corporate policies and procedures. The employees are, therefore, required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Bank. Any deviation may lead to strict disciplinary action.

The following Committees, comprising of senior executives, fulfill their responsibilities to ensure adherence to policies, rules and regulations:

- Disciplinary Action Committee
- Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee
- Grievance Handling Committee

The Bank’s Disciplinary Action Committee decides the action to be taken against a staff member in the event that the Bank and/or its clients sustain any losses, damages and/or claims due to any illegal activity or any actions/inactions of the employee in breach of the Code of Conduct, and/or any other policy of the Bank.

The Anti-Corruption Policy as well as other policies relating to Business Ethics are described in the Employee Code of Conduct and Vendors/Suppliers Enlistment Process. These policies are applicable to all the employees, in all the operations, as well as to all the Board Members. Top-level commitment is essential in ensuring dedication, focus and compliance with the anti-corruption framework. The work within anti-corruption and related policies is authorised, endorsed and supported by the Board of Directors, and President and CEO.

# Formulation and Implementation of Remuneration Policy and Assessment of Board Performance

During the year 2020, A. F. Fergusons - member firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged to assist the Bank in implementation of the Remuneration Policy Guidelines issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The scope included drafting the mechanism for identification of Material Risk Takers and Material Risk Controllers, review of their existing scorecards and preparation of risk-adjusted scorecards, drafting the Remuneration Policy for the Bank, including deferral mechanism, and assisting the Bank in implementation of the policy.

The BoD has the overall responsibility for reviewing, approving and monitoring implementation of the bank-wide Remuneration Framework, based on the recommendations of Board Human Resources Remuneration and Nominations Committee (BHR&NC). In addition, the Board, through BHR&NC, reviews on periodic basis, reports on remuneration structure, including the composition of fixed and variable remuneration of the President and CEO and the Management Team (direct reportees of the President and CEO and Board/Board Committees).

The Board remains responsible for determining compensation and benefits for certain corporate roles, including the President and CEO, CFO, Head of Audit and Inspection, and Company Secretary.

# Features of total compensation

The Bank offers a compensation structure with a balanced mix of fixed and variable elements. The compensation mix is periodically reviewed by Human Capital Group to ensure external competitiveness and internal adequacy. The review also takes into account the results of performance evaluations, and assigned roles and responsibilities. The objective of maintaining a balanced pay mix is to encourage behaviours focused on the achievement of long-term sustainable results.

# Objectives of the Framework

1. To promote and be consistent with sound and effective risk management, and not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk thresholds of the Bank;
2. To ensure that the remuneration practice is in line with the Bank’s objectives, taking into consideration all major risks that the Bank may face, and promotes and supports long-term performance;
3. To align remuneration with risk appetite and with conduct expectations of the Bank, regulators and stakeholders;
4. To attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, but also reward those who promote corporate values correlated with long-term value generation.

# Governance Framework

The Bank’s Governance Framework, with respect to these guidelines, aims at ensuring appropriate control oversight on remuneration practices.




# GOVERNANCE

- Factors considered for differentiating variable pays across employees or group of employees

# Types of employees considered as Material Risk Takers (MRTs) and Material Risk Controller (MRCs)

The inclusion criteria have been developed in accordance with the guidelines and applicable best practices, and are subject to approval by the BHR&NC. The inclusion criteria comprises of two sections; namely the qualitative and quantitative MRT/MRC inclusion criteria.

# Qualitative inclusion criteria

The following qualitative criteria shall be applied for identification of MRTs and MRCs:

1. President and CEO, or any other equivalent position;
2. Members of the Management Team, i.e. reporting directly to the President and CEO, and the BoD or any Board Committee;
3. Members of critical Management Committees;
4. Heads of critical functions responsible for managing business, risks and controls, that may subject the Bank to significant risks; and
5. Country Heads of overseas branches, unless the related branch is subject to similar remuneration regulations in the host countries.

# Quantitative inclusion criteria

Quantitative inclusion criteria includes:

1. Credit Risk;
2. Market Risk;
3. Operational Risk; and
4. Liquidity Risk.

# Responsibility levels of the key executives and Directors

# Compensations provided to non-executive Directors

In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Policy on Directors' Remuneration was unanimously approved by the shareholders of the Bank in the 28th Annual General Meeting held on 27th March, 2020. The basis of compensation provided to non-executive Directors is covered in the said policy.

# Remuneration provided to the Shariah Board Members and its components

The remuneration of the Shariah Board is governed under the compensation policy approved by the Board of Directors.

# Fixed and variable pay provided to senior executives, including CEO, MRCs and MRTs

# Fixed Pay

For fixed pay, HRLG annually derives an appropriate benchmark with external market data, in order to ensure the appropriateness of the fixed remuneration for the Bank to be able to attract and retain the relevant resources, particularly in relation to the MRTs/ MRCs.

# Variable Pay

Variable remuneration takes into account performance of the Bank’s, the Group, business unit/product and individuals. Achievement/underachievement of financial performance, excessive or undue risks, customer experience, audit/internal controls/compliance issues, etc. are generally considered for determining risk-adjusted variable remuneration. Performance-based remuneration in the form of annual or periodic bonuses and sales incentives are disbursed in cash and/or share options.



GOVERNANCE

In accordance with relevant HR policies and frameworks, the basis for payment of bonuses and awards to CEO, senior executives and MRTs/MRCs is determined keeping in view the achievement of KPIs in all value drivers. The Bank ensures that Risk Control Function employees are remunerated independently of the functions they oversee:

1. The Bank ensures provision of adequate feedback on relevant risk adjustments in the risk-adjusted balanced scorecards of MRTs/MRCs;
2. The Bank reviews the targets and measurement benchmarks against relevant risk adjustments, assigned within the risk-adjusted balanced scorecards to ensure alignment with the risk profile and risk appetite of the Bank; and
3. The Bank ensures timely provision of information/feedback to assist in performance evaluation against risk adjustments of MRTs/MRCs.

Deferred remuneration, especially with risk adjustments, is a useful tool for improving risk-taking incentives because the amount ultimately received by employees can be made to depend on risk outcomes. The deferral amount shall be withheld for a period of three years whereas the remaining portion of the variable compensation shall be paid upfront to the CEO, key executives and MRTs/MRCs. The deferred remuneration shall vest proportionately over the deferral period following the year of the variable remuneration award.

The deferred portion of the variable remuneration shall be paid to the CEO, key executives, and MRTs/MRCs proportionally through yearly instalments, during the deferred period, in case no malus triggers are applicable. In case of malus, and where accountability has been determined in accordance with the conduct and accountability framework of the Bank, the entire or certain portion of the deferred remuneration shall be withheld and not paid to the CEO, key executives and MRTs/MRCs on becoming due, and will be recorded back as income in the books of accounts of the Bank.

Policy on vesting and deferral of variable remuneration: A certain portion of variable compensation of the CEO, key executives, MRTs/MRCs are subject to mandatory deferrals for a defined period, thus creating alignment.

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Bank Alfalah Limited (the Bank) for the year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022.

# Statement of Internal Controls

This Statement of Internal Controls is based upon an ongoing process designed to identify the significant risks in achieving the bank’s policies, aims and objectives, and to evaluate nature and extent of those risks, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. This process remained in place throughout the year 2022.

The Board of Directors (Board) considers a sound control framework as the key to sustainable growth and value creation. The Board is ultimately responsible for the internal controls system of the Bank. Further, the Board has defined role of the Board’s Audit Committee (BAC) and Senior Management to establish and maintain an adequate and effective system of Internal Controls. Every endeavor is made to implement sound control procedures and to maintain a robust control environment.

The Bank’s Internal Control Policy outlines the overall Control Objectives, the Bank’s Controls Framework as well as the Bank’s approach towards implementation of the framework. Bank Alfalah Control Framework (the framework) is structured on the lines of globally recognized “Three Line of Defense Model” in which Business/Support Unit serves as First Line of Defense, various Risk, Controls & Compliance oversight functions are serving as Second Line of Defense, while independent assurance is the Third (Audit and Inspection Group). The framework focuses on devising policies and procedures that outline control activities so that process owners perform their functions without any risk exposure. This aspect is further evaluated and monitored through various organizational functions, such as Risk Management, Compliance & Internal Controls, etc.

The Bank has an online Internal Controls Dashboard (ICD Dashboard) for centralized monitoring of controls. It serves as a tool to enhance the entity wide coverage of control risk exposure through timely identification of operational and regulatory risks, including control breaches at the branches and other functions. It assists in instant closure/rectification of issues preventing the Bank from financial and reputational losses. It helps to analyse major control gaps, devise corrective action plan and cater to the training needs of the staff. ICD dashboard has transformed the whole spectrum of controls and compliance monitoring from the sample based periodic reviews of selected entities to continuous monitoring of key risk areas with coverage of entire population.

The Board of Directors has instituted an effective Audit function (Audit & Inspection Group), reporting to the Board through the Board Audit Committee, which not only monitors compliance with the Bank’s policies, procedures, controls and reports significant deviations regularly to the Board Audit Committee, but also regularly reviews the adequacy of the overall internal control system. Comprehensive reviews of AML / CFT and other critical regulatory areas are carried out through alerts and exceptions generated from the dashboard. Anomalies identified as a result of these reviews are conveyed to the concerned stakeholders for taking necessary remedial measures, which significantly improves the control environment of the Bank. During the year 2022, ICD Dashboard coverage was extended to various critical business & operation functions alerts for timely monitoring and mitigation of risk exposure to safeguard the Bank from any financial or reputational losses. Besides this, significant issues were escalated to senior management.

# Management’s Evaluation on Effectiveness of Control Framework

The Bank follows SBP guidelines on Internal Controls including guidelines pertaining to Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). The Bank’s ICFR exercise is conducted annually with an objective to review the processes and operating effectiveness of controls over key areas of the Bank’s operations, which affect financial reporting. ICFR unit, under Finance Division, is responsible for carrying out the implementation of the stage-wise ICFR Framework and perform tests of controls for the management functions.

In line with SBP exemption from the requirement of external auditors’ Long Form Report (LFR), Audit and Inspection Group of the Bank reviewed the bank’s ICFR function for the year 2021 and submitted an Assessment Report to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). The ICFR review for 2022 is in progress and an Assessment Report will be submitted to BAC during first quarter of 2023 in line with regulatory requirements.

The management believes that the Bank’s existing system of Internal Controls is considered reasonable in design and is functioning effectively and constantly monitored. There is a continuous improvement in the Bank’s Control Environment including technological solutions. Based upon the work performed, the management keeps on identifying areas for process improvements as well as implement additional controls required for strengthening existing controls. The management takes all necessary steps to ensure that the timelines and priorities assigned to the same are adhered to.

The Bank shall continue in its endeavor to further enhance its internal control design and assessment process in accordance with the industry best practices.

The Board of Directors has duly endorsed management’s evaluation of internal controls, including ICFR.

# Forward Looking Statement

Narrative Statement well-positioned for sustainable growth and building long-term shareholders’ value. We will continue to invest in human capital and in strengthening compliance and controls environment. At the same time, the Bank will continue to focus on improving the return on capital on risk assets, optimising returns from the banking book and enforcing a strong cost discipline across the Bank.

Furthermore, along with all this, we believe our employees are fundamental to our existence and growth. Therefore, we are determined to continue investing in human capital and creating a culture of care and compassion.

Pakistan's economy is severely affected on account of the aforementioned global situation coupled with a concerning domestic scenario. Monetary tightening measures introduced at the start of the current fiscal year have led to a slowdown in economic activity across the country. The situation was further aggravated by the socio-economic aftershocks of catastrophic monsoon flooding which led to a loss of livelihood (employment, livestock and harvests), the spread of waterborne diseases and rising food costs. This combined with import restrictions to curb the trade deficit, higher energy costs, depleting foreign reserves, high interest rates, rising inflation and devaluation of the local currency resulted in significant demand curtailment along with international ratings agencies downgrading Pakistan’s credit rating during the year 2022.

Given the current economic environment and the risk of credit headwinds, the Bank continues to follow prudent risk management practices and manage the loan book optimally. In line with the Bank’s mission, we seek to be the preferred bank for our customers and will always put our customers and their needs first. Regaining and growing our market share in low cost deposits, consumer products and SME financing are still our primary target. We will continue to expand our reach to our customers by growing our branch network and tapping new markets. Enhancing trade market share and penetration in cash management with high attention to SME/commercial clients will remain our top priority.

Furthermore considering the changing business environment, we are constantly focused on business process re-engineering and digital transformation. At Bank Alfalah, our key focus will remain on utilising technological advancements to improve our banking services and provide superior customer services. The foundation of our growth is based on innovation on technology and digital front in order to keep up with the global and domestic market dynamics.

# Quantitative projections

The chronic issues faced by Pakistan persists and pose a challenge to overall economic growth of the country including banking industry. With galloping inflation and yawning current account deficit, adhering to harsh IMF conditions will be inevitable for ensuring fiscal discipline and moving out of the current economic crisis. Continuing political and economic uncertainty along with government’s contractionary measures will have serious consequences for all business activities. We expect elevated interest rates in the coming year resulting in higher spreads and significant growth in net interest income of the bank. However, fee and commission lines will be under pressure because of depressed economic activities, restrictions on imports and FX challenges. We are already witnessing shift of remittances to non-banking channels due to widening gap between official and open market exchange rates, which has bridged to an extent post recent depreciation of rupee. With rising interest rates the bank will see limited capital gains. Furthermore, IFRS 9 application from January 1, 2023 has changed the treatment of gain on available for sale equity investments with no recycling to PL.

The Bank’s strong financial position, processes and controls make it resilient to these changes, many of which were tested in 2022. The results of these stress tests were presented to the management committees and the board committees for information and forward guidance.

# Uncertainties that Could Affect the Bank’s Resource, Revenues and Operations

All forward looking statements are by nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, and some of these are beyond our control. The impacts could vary from short term to medium and long term. Factors that may potentially affect the Bank’s resources, revenues and operations are as follows:

- Decisions on discount rate/monetary policy;
- Geo-political risks and uncertainties across the geography that we operate in;
- Law and order situation;
- Cyber Security;
- Local government rules and regulations;
- Trade policies of trade partner countries;
- Changing priorities at the regulators’ end;
- Inflation, fuel and general commodity prices; and
- Corporate taxation measures.

On the other hand, we expect stronger credit headwinds leading to higher NPLs as a result of the tough operating environment. The bank continues to closely monitor health of portfolio and make prudent provisioning to improve coverage. We remain committed to facilitate the SME and consumer sectors in line with our key strategy. However, with elevated interest rates and other restrictions, we foresee limited credit offtake.

The bank intends to operate at higher than 50% ADR as it does not attract higher taxation. We aim to continue our growth trajectory for gaining market share across the key performance drivers while being cognizant of the operating environment. We foresee industry-wide pricing pressure in advances as other banks will try to improve their ADR. Moreover, current deposits mobilization will become difficult in high interest environment as customers will shift to lucrative interest-bearing deposits.

We plan to increase the Bank’s touch-points i.e. new branches and further deployment of ATMs, CDMs and CCDMs despite import and payment related issues. Certain new initiatives planned for 2023, which are necessary for long-term growth, will result in cost escalation, while contribution to revenue will be visible in later periods. On the other hand, unprecedented high inflation and significant devaluation will impact our cost to income ratio. The bank’s operating profit is expected to improve from last year based on our forecasts in view of present day operating environment.

In line with the Bank’s strategy, we aspire to be the most customer-centric and innovative bank in the country with a caring culture.

To cope with changing business dynamics, we will accelerate digital transformation and focus on business process re-engineering.

To cater to our customers' advanced digital needs we made the onboarding of existing and new customers effortless by introducing RAPID.

# Alfalah RAPID

Alfalah RAPID provides the following digital features to fulfill the banking needs of our customers at their convenience. Customers can do the following anywhere in the world through the Rapid portal:

- Open new deposits accounts, i.e. current and saving accounts
- Apply for consumer products such as debit cards, credit cards and personal loans

- Roshan Digital Account holders can apply for credit card.

Alfalah’s internal application of Sales Management System (SMS) which aids the sales staff of the Bank to improve sales, track their progress and enhance their service was upgraded to SMS version 2.5 with enhanced configuration and customization changes like Lead Management and Email Management. The Bank is actively developing SMS 3.0 to add additional features such as customer profiling, integration with BPM, Rosetta and Aspire etc which should further complement and enhance our sales efforts.

In order to expand its branch network while providing innovative solutions, the Bank has also planned to launch “Digital” Branches at select locations in 2023.

# Market Share Growth

We will work hard to regain and grow our market share in low cost deposits, consumer products and SME financing.

With a great emphasis on building a low cost deposit base, our total deposits stands at PKR 1.487 Trn and current deposits at PKR 661.365 Bn as at Dec’22 end. These numbers are achieved through a segmented sales approach based on ideal customer personas and selective branch expansion in key areas.

disclosed last year respectively (Dec’21: PKR 73.29 Bn). Similarly, Personal loans closing balance also grew in 2022 and now stands at PKR 9.83 Bn (compared to PKR 6.78 Bn in Dec’21). On the other hand, industry wide slump has impacted growth in auto finance and gross outstanding volumes marginally declined from Dec’21 to PKR 47.87 Bn in Dec’22 (Dec’21: PKR 49.08 Bn).

The Bank is a prominent player in the SME sector with a loan book of PKR 39.6 Bn at Dec’22. Simultaneously, we participated in the Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan Programme Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme (PMKJ-YES) to provide self-employment opportunities to unemployed youth and distributed PKR 2.6 Bn loans.

With our focus being on financial inclusion and financial awareness/education, various initiatives were launched including awareness sessions jointly with Chamber of Commerce (various cities), webinars and introduction to SME Toolkit (online portal) etc. This year we emphasized on lead generation and business growth along with promoting financial inclusion of Women by partnering with Greenstar, Invest2Innovate, SMEDA LadiesFund, USAID SMEA and APWA.

Furthermore, in 2022, the Bank (both Conventional and Islamic) extended financing to various SME sectors under the SBP’s scheme of SME Asaan Finance scheme (SAAF). We are currently running the widest range of Product Programs for SMEs.

To address the issue of lack of collateral regarding financing, Bank Alfalah has launched Value Chain Financing initiative. It has successfully added cash flow based, non-collateralized products/program-based lending to its product suite instead of traditional business practices with efficient turnaround time. Additionally, we also provide after sales support which adds to trust building with our partners.

Bank Alfalah also launched Digital Working Capital Finance for SME clients in May 2022. The product is offered to Bank Alfalah’s Alfa Payment Gateway Merchants with credit facility up to PKR 15 Mn.

We look forward to expanding our branch network to widen our reach and serve our customers. Bank Alfalah has accelerated its strategic focus on expanding its network to 894 branches in 2022, in order to enhance market coverage through increased customer touchpoints.

To grow our conventional network, we added 51 new branches during 2022. Furthermore, as at Dec’22 our Premier footprint has presence at 50+ locations across the country via our Premier Lounges.

In order to grow the Islamic outreach, the Bank opened 53 new Islamic branches. Islamic Premier services are also available through their 19 lounges spread across in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Peshawar.

For Financial Inclusion of Specially Abled Persons (SAPs) / Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), Bank Alfalah ensures our financial services become accessible to all. Islamic Banking Group led the project by introducing 16

disclosed last year dedicated Model Branches that are operational all across the country in 2022. These branches are fully equipped to facilitate PwDs through various means such as presence of ramps, talking ATMs, braille stationery, accessible counters and out-of-queue assistance.

Our focus will be on harnessing technology to ensure that customers’ banking needs are fully met in a technologically advanced, secure and convenient manner.

The Bank runs the largest network of Cash Deposit Machines in Pakistan with 393 CDMs (as of Dec’22) across the country resulting in CDM migration to reach 42%. Furthermore, bank’s digital transaction expanded greatly with migration of over-the-counter transactions to digital platform, generating throughput of PKR. 2.2 Tn during the year.

The Bank also enabled debit card management (card activation/deactivation, PIN generation/change) through digital channels. In order to migrate traffic from branches to digital channels, requests for banker’s cheques, account statements and cheque books have been enabled on Internet Banking and the Mobile Banking App. Moreover, to enhance user experience, the following features/products were introduced:

- Virtual debit card
- WhatsApp banking
- S-Paisa that enabled branchless banking in AJK and GB
- Automation of payroll onboarding
- Best Buy collaboration for digitising collection
- Tap and Pay – a contactless card transaction
- Ask Alfa

The Bank also launched digital Alfa Islamic Account for onboarding, digitally acquiring customers who prefer Islamic banking for their daily transactional and saving needs.

Moreover, Bank Alfalah was the first bank to install the Big Data Warehouse solution. This platform has helped the Bank to build analytics and machine learning models with structured and unstructured data that complements decision-making throughout the organization.

# Greater emphasis will be on boosting trade volumes, increasing penetration in cash management with the focus on SME/commercial clients.

Bank Alfalah successfully captured trade volumes of PKR 1,623 Bn as at end Dec ’22, up by 35% from Dec ’21. This growth was achieved through better customer service, competitive pricing, reducing TAT, and focusing on SME clients.

In 2022, Alfalah focused on developing Oracle Banking Digital Experience (OBDX) by incorporating the online procedures of Export LC’s, Letter of Guarantees, Export Bills etc. to make it easy for our corporate clients to Trade and initiate transactions online thereby reducing TATs.

In 2022, Cash Management also focused on migration of Payments and Collection modules on Oracle Banking Digital Experience (OBDX).

Furthermore, we successfully penetrated the service industry including schools, social clubs, large superstores and hospitals, Big Mandates such as State Life and Etimad, WAPDA and Adamjee. Consequently, the total throughput for the year 2022 was PKR 1,377 Bn which is 81.4% higher than 2021 levels.

# Investing in human capital and creating a caring culture will be a priority.

In 2022, the Human Capital Group focused on three areas i.e. Culture, Diversity & Inclusion and Learning Development in accordance with Bank Alfalah’s 2021-2025 strategy.

As Bank Alfalah continues to evolve and progress, HRLG will direct its efforts to ensure that the Bank becomes an employer of choice. Our key focus will be on building a happy workforce along with a value-driven culture, ensuring conscious hiring, development, and merit-based elevation of female employees.

Furthermore, safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our employees during the coronavirus crisis, introducing various digitised initiatives for existing and potential employees and continuing to support our business functions will also be given prime importance.

# Leadership Development Program

Leadership Development Program was initiated at 3 levels across bank to enable behaviours in alignment with our culture and value behaviours. At the heart of the DE&I agenda which is to develop women and to prepare them for leadership roles, BAFL launched a sponsorship programme where women are given opportunity to be coached by Senior Executives for a period of 6 months. In addition, another programme called “SheLead” which is an inhouse signature leadership development programme for women is also used to develop women leaders.

As an advocate of gender & diversity, BAFL initiated Gender Stereotype E-learning, Gender Lens on elevations and other processes, Women Engagement sessions, Women’s Day Campaign and Pulse Check Survey. Due to the success of our initiatives in promoting the agenda of DE&I, BAFL won 10 awards at GDEIB.

# Sources of Information and Assumptions used for Projections and Forecasts

The Bank has based its projections on internal and external factors. External factors include discount rate, inflation rate, external account position, industry analysis, GDP growth, and other macroeconomic indicators, while internal factors comprise of strategic objectives, financial performance and competitive edge. Such indicators, along with certain assumptions for the forecasted period, are incorporated into programmed models to get a desired level of growth outcome.

# Assumptions

# Economic Position

In 2022, Pakistan’s economy witnessed adverse impacts due to its vulnerabilities to external factors. The economy was severely hit by international commodity super cycle, increasing political uncertainties, rising inflationary and current account pressures along with floods which depleted FX reserves. Going forward, in 2023, due to relative softening of commodity prices, pressure on current account is expected to ease off. However, due to ongoing external debt repayments, pressure on Pakistan’s FX reserves is expected to remain elevated.

# Discount Rate

State Bank of Pakistan increased policy rate by 625 bps from 9.75% to 16% in response to emerging inflationary and external pressures. Going forward, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue to carefully monitor economic developments affecting medium to long term prospects and respond accordingly.

# Significant External Factors and the Bank’s Response

Bank Alfalah’s external environment, including political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors have an impact on business performance, strategic objectives and availability, quality, and affordability of capital.

# Macroeconomic Environment

The year 2022 has been a challenging year for both Pakistan and International economies. The global food and energy supply chain have been drastically impacted by Russia-Ukraine conflict on one side and stringent COVID policy in China on other side. The recovery in international demand post COVID ease off combined with supply constraints set the foundation for international commodity super cycle for an extended period of CY2022. Pakistan has been largely impacted by the super cycle with historical high levels of imports, substantially high Current Account deficit & inflation along with rapidly depleting FX reserves.

With the recovering demand, limited supply and low level of inventories, the price of essential commodities like crude, wheat and palm oil touched its peak in 1H22 at more than 40% above the levels of Dec’21. Resultantly, global economies witnessed drastic surge in inflationary pressures and Central Banks across the globe stepped in with monetary tightening tools to curb inflation and ensure long term sustainable growth. The adverse impact of higher international commodity prices was also amplified for Pakistan on account of catastrophic floods in the country. The total economic impact of flood on production has been estimated in USD billions and are expected to put a strain on external position.

Pakistan’s economy witnessed robust growth in FY22 on the back of increased spending and import growth. Pakistan’s GDP grew by 6.2% in FY22 against the target of 4.8% and a growth of 3.94% in FY21. However, as Government took stringent measures to manage aggregate demand, the economy is showing signs of contraction and GDP growth is estimated at 2% for FY2022-23. Additionally, on account of major loss of crops due to floods, the agriculture sector is also expected to decline. From the revenue perspective, Government has projected a primary surplus in FY23.

Similar to other emerging markets, Pakistan’s economy also witnessed worsening external position primarily from higher global commodities prices, increased global demand and supply shortages due to Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Current account deficit was recorded at USD 17.5 billion for FY22 compared with SBP’s target of USD 12-13 billion. Due to administrative measures and softening in international commodity prices, CAD has significantly improved in the recent months. SBP expects the current account deficit to sustain at moderate levels of 3% of GDP (USD 10 billion) in FY23.

On the financing side, inflows were negatively affected by domestic uncertainty and tight global financial conditions as major central banks continue to raise policy rates. Resultantly, the FX reserves depleted rapidly to USD 5.6 billion unit after paying back Pakistan Euro Bond in Dec’22.

OUTLOOK
The momentum of general and core inflations remained upwards in 2022 due to higher commodity prices in international markets, increased demand in local economy, and PKR weakening against USD. The adjustment in power tariffs and increase in the local petroleum prices put further pressure on transport costs and on prices of commodities in local economy.

# Bank’s Response

Changes in the macro-environment, ranging from inflation and/or currency pressures, affect the performance of the Bank, which is reflected in our results and in the stock price of the Bank. The Bank keeps a track of key metrics that might affect profitability and as per its best judgement, pre-empts developments and aligns its internal strategy accordingly. The Bank thus takes measures such as balance sheet re-alignment to take optimum benefit and protect the franchise from adverse economic moves.

# Policy Changes

Any policy changes that directly impact the banking landscape, and cost and/or revenue drivers are likely to exert the influence on the Bank’s performance. For example, a change in the discount rate, which directly impacts yields on all earning assets and liabilities, would have considerable impact. Similarly, any regulatory changes such as a change in the minimum rate payable on deposits and schemes brought in by the SBP can have a significant impact on the cost of funds and profitability.

In order to counter inflationary pressures and ensure growth sustainability, the SBP acted promptly by increasing the interest rates by 625 basis points to 16%. Moreover, SBP is gradually reducing the stimulus in the economy to contain aggregate demand.

# Investor and Market Sentiment

While difficult to quantify in numeric terms, a change in the sentiments regarding the investment climate in general or the stock market in particular can have an impact on the Bank’s stock price, even if there is no fundamental development or change in the Bank’s investment or business case. As the macroeconomic and political situation unfolded, Pakistan equities remained bearish and volatile with the benchmark KSE-100 index falling by 9.4% in 2022. The equity market started the year on a positive note amid foreign buying, IMF tranche disbursement and

International sukuk bond issuance. However, political uncertainties, macroeconomic deterioration and floods hampered the sentiment towards the subsequent quarters. The lacklustre investors’ interest was also visible in the lower trading activity, with average daily trading volumes dropping by 52% to 230 mn shares and value by 59% to PKR 6.9 bn shares. Foreign investors remained seller (net outflow of USD 48 mn). Locally, mutual funds and insurance sector remained on the selling side which was absorbed by individuals, companies and banks.

# Bank’s Response

Bank Alfalah launched a Flood Relief Program to support the fellow countrymen affected by the natural disaster in 2022. Through this program, Bank Alfalah has partnered with the credible charitable organizations who are taking up the mantle and have commenced work in this regard for distributing food, medical supplies, and other amenities to the flood affectees. Bank Alfalah, on guidance and philanthropic focus of its Chairman, His Highness Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, generously donated USD 10Mn for flood relief efforts in Pakistan. The employees of the Bank also generously contributed a portion of their salaries, made donations and provided essential items towards the flood relief.

# Legal and Regulatory Environment

Major challenges faced by the banking sector are trade-based money laundering and terror financing. Legal environment also encompasses the restrictions and constraints set by FATF, IMF and other international bodies. Additionally, with the growing use of digital channels, there is an even greater threat to financial security.

A stable political environment is essential to the smooth running and growth of the banking industry. Investor confidence is dependent upon a stable law and order situation, as it directly impacts the banking sector and equity market. The political environment inside the country as well as across the world affects the ability of the Bank to implement its strategy.

# Bank’s Response

Bank Alfalah worked towards enhancing customer experience and increasing business activity, while abiding by the standards and guidelines set by FATF, the SBP and other regulatory bodies on AML/CFT/CPF, Trade AML, information security threats including identity theft etc. The Bank also complies with the UNSC Targeted Financial Sanctions on Designated Persons and Proscribed Persons. This is done by making the best use of Regulatory Technology Tools and skilled human resources.

# Given the importance of evolving political risks, there are three ways the bank prioritizes actionable steps to address the strategic and financial impact of these risks:

- Better integration of this risk in the overall risk framework of the bank.
- More holistic scenario analysis: Scenario planning offers another opportunity for the bank to improve how it factors in political developments.
- Top-down and bottom-up stakeholder engagement: Coordination with peer banks directly or via industry groups to address growing societal risks.

# Social Environment

2022 continued the momentum witnessed in 2021 towards increased demand for banking services in general, particularly digital banking solutions. Society is slowly adapting to methods once unfamiliar, which include digital wallets, online transfers and branchless banking. To cater to the growing needs of the customers, new initiatives were launched like digital account opening and end-to-end digital payments within seconds.

# Technological Environment

There is a mass explosion of intelligent technologies and rapid transformation of the country’s technological landscape, especially in digital and AI technologies. Ever-evolving customer expectations and state-led digitisation initiatives have created expectations for improved customer experience, strengthened data governance strategies, and holistic and more granular solutions-centric security and privacy measures.

284  BANK ALFALAH

OUTLOOK
As these technological advancements continue, underlying risks of damage by internal or external threat factors like unauthorised access to critical financial data, sensitive customer information, impersonation, theft or alteration of information, non-availability of essential systems or services, and loss of the Bank’s sensitive electronic data and IT systems, has increased manifold. As a response, regulatory frameworks governing technology have been broadened and deepened.

# Environmental Scenario

Globally, organisations and countries are adapting to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are actively integrating all or some of the 17 goals of the UN in their plans in order to move towards a sustainable world. Pakistan’s geographical location makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change as it is highly dependent on natural resources like agriculture and water. Increased environmental threats (global warming, poor air quality, carbon emissions, deforestation) indicate that prompt actions are required. The recent floods in Pakistan have added to the environmental threats overall; increased risk of waterborne diseases, depletion of necessities (health facilities, clean drinking water, infrastructure etc.) and disruption in supply of agriculture and livestock. This consequently affects the poverty rate and increases macroeconomic risks. The Banking industry plays an important role in dealing with the environmental risks by integrating and encouraging sustainable approaches within the organisation as well as evaluating stakeholders’ relations and investment options.

# Bank’s Response

At BAFL, the early adoption of technologies and innovative solutions’ delivery has already positioned us amongst the top customers’ choice banks and transformed the solution design and delivery paradigm. All technology decisions are pivoted to our “YOU” philosophy while technology and security teams collaborate for strong governance placing customers’ confidence and security second to nothing. However, these digital technologies have also created enhanced cyber-threat surface areas and multidimensional attack vectors.

The Bank’s Information Security team caters to regulatory requirements for Information Security Risk Management, maintains the frameworks that enable the Bank’s Management and staff to mitigate IT security risks bringing them to acceptable levels, researches evolving and emerging threats, and suggests and defines relevant information security controls.

Furthermore, the Bank’s Resilience Plan caters to loss of access to critical systems or services due to cyber-attacks, non-availability of key personnel, wide-scale disruptions due to pandemic outbreaks etc. To withstand any adverse technological disruption, the Bank’s critical technology infrastructure is designed and tested to continue from alternate sites for prolonged durations. Furthermore, Bank Alfalah has been continually augmenting its security posture vis-à-vis its digital positioning by investing in security technologies to deepen its cyber defences and by proactive adoption of international best practice advisories/frameworks.

The digital banking landscape continues to experience an encouraging inflow of customers. The banking industry as a whole increased its focus and contribution towards digital channels. Customer experience became integral and continues to evolve to provide a seamless experience. Individuals grew more comfortable using digital channels compared to previous years. There was an overall acceleration of digitisation, and banks responded by providing state-of-the-art solutions to their customers. The digitisation drive will continue in the coming years and we believe that the winning catalyst for the Bank shall remain the sustained trust of our customers in our services.

# Competitive Landscape and Market positioning

# Competitive Landscape

Threat of New Competition and Substitute products or Services There are significant barriers to the entry for new competition due to the need for considerable capital to set up a bank, compliance with strict regulations of the banking sector, and the time required to establish a strong brand identity, and, in turn, loyalty of customers. However, the emergence of Fintech entities with their innovative digital solutions and focus on transactional services has added greater depth to the domestic financial landscape and the customers’ banking experience.

# Bank’s Response:

Bank Alfalah exercised the following strategies to cater to the threat of new competition:

- Enhancing customer loyalty through excellence in customer service
- Focusing on digital platforms to improve customer convenience
- Introducing innovative products and services to facilitate diversified customer needs
- Partnerships and collaboration with Fintech start-ups
- New digital branch on horizon

# Bargaining power of Customers

The bargaining power of customers mainly rests with the Bank’s deposit holders, and since they are the Bank’s primary source of capital, their bargaining power ranges from medium to high. This is because of low costs incurred by customers while switching to other banks partly or completely. The Bank’s bottom line is minimally affected due to such shifts.

# Bargaining power of Suppliers

Suppliers mainly represent service providers of various administrative facilities such as supply of equipment and their periodic maintenance, security services, repairs and site maintenance, printing, deliveries to customers, clearing of cheques, brokerage, etc. They have an

# PERFORMANCE AND POSITION

# Analysis of Financial and Non-Financial Performance

# Prospects of the Entity

Bank Alfalah is one of the fastest growing banks in Pakistan. The Bank is trailblazing in digital banking domain. We aim to extend our outreach through a broader distribution footprint, digitised front-end channels and back-end processes. The Bank’s focus remains on nurturing human capital. The Bank continues to invest in its people through extensive trainings and development initiatives.

# Financial Measures

The Bank takes into account financial measures, while arriving at future projections. Targets are defined against the following broad financial measures:

- Deposits: The Bank periodically reviews the quality of its deposit mix with focus on CASA. Apart from the deposit mix, the pricing of deposit / spread is an important matter in origination.
- Advances: Sustainable growth in advances, on the back of deposit growth, is the key behind profitability, as advances remain the prime strategic pillar for the institution. The Bank places great emphasis on credit quality and segmental diversification of its credit portfolio. Growth in advances needs to be managed effectively, as this has a direct impact on credit risk. A robust risk assessment mechanism is essential to maintain quality of the credit portfolio.
- Investments: The Bank, depending on the interest rate forecasts, manages its short and long term bonds portfolio to maximize return. The bank keeps an ideal balance in view of rate expectation with the objective of earning high profits.
- Business Volume: These are driven by business units which help achieve resources linked to the sale of products and services to the customers. This incorporates new-to-business customer deposits and advances, trade business volumes, advisory services, over the counter services, and services channeled through digital platforms etc. One-shop solutions and cross-sell initiatives have been a major breakthrough in terms of escalating business volumes.

# Non-Financial Measures

Non-financial measures are of equal significance when setting the path for the future. Performance outlined against such measures confirm that the Bank is not only sound and transparent in terms of business operations, but also recognises its due role as a responsible corporate citizen. Although such standards are qualitative in nature, their value to the business has been significant in recent years. Non-financial measures mainly consist of:

- Compliance with the regulatory framework
- Corporate image
- Stakeholders’ engagement
- Brand preference
- Relationship with customers and business partners
- Employee satisfaction and well-being
- Responsibility towards the society
- Environmental protection
- SBP inspection rating and effective internal control

Please refer the following pages for financial position, financial performance analysis and financial and non-financial ratios.

Please refer the following page for qualitative performance analysis.




# PERFORMANCE AND POSITION

The bank outperformed budget in both profitability and business volumes.

Over the course of the years, key changes to our technology platform, cross-sell initiatives, branch transformation programmes, have helped the Bank deliver further transactional convenience to its customers, and have facilitated contribution from non-fund based income.

# Cash Flow Statement

# Cash Flow from Operating Activities:

Cash flow from operating activities showed a positive trend in all years from 2017 to 2022 except 2018. This is primarily due to steady growth in profitability, stable deposits and advances. In 2018, due to re-profiling of balance sheet and consequent increase in loan book, the cash flow from operating activities is negative.

# Cash Flow from Investing Activities:

The residual funds available after loans and advances is invested in the high yielding government securities. The investment is also required to comply with the Statutory Liquidity Requirement of the State Bank of Pakistan. In all years under review the bank has increased its investment portfolio except in case of 2018, when the portfolio was channeled into loans and advances in view of interest rates.

# Cash Flow from Financing Activities:

The main transaction under this head are those likely to capital and providence of capital. Bank Alfalah has paid steady dividend in all the years under review with the exception of 2017. The dividend payment and TFC redemptions result in cash outflow from financing activities. In 2018, the cash flow is positive due to issuance of ADT 1 instrument. In 2022, major transactions include the issuance of ADT 1 and buy back of 200 million ordinary shares.

# Operating Expenses

Over the years, the Bank has seen a significant transformation. The overall growth in administrative costs has primarily been on account of costs attributable to additional branches under the Bank’s expansion plan, rising rentals and utility costs, inflation, impact of rupee depreciation, donation and significant IT costs relating to infrastructural improvements to the core banking system and the overall technological platform including digital banking platform. However, the Bank has kept a check on these factors, and strict cost discipline measures were introduced with a focus on improving the cost to income ratio. Centralisation of various expenses and regular revisits to expenditure approval authorities were undertaken to keep costs in check. Non-recurring items continue to be tracked separately.

The DuPont model is derived from an analysis of return on equity that divides performance into three parts: (a) Operating efficiency ratio which is also known as financial performance ratio is measured by net operating margin; (b) assets use efficiency which shows if assets were utilized efficiently and is measured by total asset turnover; and (c) financial leverage which shows to what extent the bank relies on debts which is measured by the equity multiplier.

The results of the study discovered that the financial performance of the bank as regards net operating margin has improved as shown in the above graph except for the drop in 2020 and 2022. In 2020, general provision of Rs. 4.250 billion was booked against borrowers availing relaxation under SBP loan deferral / re-scheduling schemes. In 2022, general provision of Rs. 5.971 billion against high risk and flood impacted portfolio, ECL charge of Rs. 1.920 billion on overseas investments, and provision of Rs. 1.114 billion against cross border risk were booked. Asset utilization is relatively steady and reflects minimal volatility during the period under review except in 2019 and 2022 where the operating income increased due to hike in discount rate by the central bank to contain inflation in the country. Equity multiplier has shown a steady increase over the period on account of robust growth in earning assets and deposits. Furthermore, return on equity showed rising trend from 2017 to 2022 with drop in 2020 due to general provision booked. The provision booked in 2022 (as discussed above) was compensated by redemption of ordinary shares.

Economic value added (EVA) is the economic profit by the bank in a given period. It measures the bank’s financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes. A positive EVA reflects that the bank is increasing its value to its shareholders, whereas a negative EVA indicates that it is diminishing its value to its shareholders.

PERFORMANCE AND POSITION


# Discount rate / Monetary Policy

Based on different assessment parameters, the State Bank of Pakistan can change the monetary policy rate. Any volatility in the interest rates might impact revenue and profitability of the bank.

# Minimum Rate of Return on Deposits/Regulatory risk

Any upward revision in the minimum deposit rate will result in compression in net interest margins earned due to increased cost of deposits. Such revision can negatively impact the earning and correspondingly the share price of the scrip.

# Inflation

Inflation is considered as a key determinant for policy rate change. Any uptick in the inflation statistics will have a corresponding impact on the monetary policy rate. With higher discount rates, the banks will be able to invest in high yielding investments, thus resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn will have a positive impact on the share price.

# Political Stability & Law and order situation

Political stability and stable law & order situation is a prerequisite for any economic development. Political stability reduces the uncertainty and urges investors to put their funds in different investment avenues. Politically stable governments will have an approach to facilitate the investors.

| - Provision against Non-Performing Credit Exposure (Refer note 9.5 to the unconsolidated financial statements) | The Bank’s credit portfolios include loans and advances, and non-funded credit facilities. The credit portfolio is spread across various domestic branches and overseas operations. As per the Bank’s accounting policy (refer note 4.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements), the Bank periodically assesses the adequacy of its provisions against non-performing credit exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan. Such regulations require specific provisioning against loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Bank’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision against certain vulnerable corporate loans, therefore, involves use of management judgment, on a case-to-case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Bank. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the unconsolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of loan loss provision as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter. We applied a range of audit procedures including the following: - We reviewed the Bank’s process for identification and classification of non-performing loans including the quality of underlying data and systems. As part of such review we performed an analysis of the changes within the different categories of classified non-performing accounts from last year to the current reporting date. This analysis was used to gather audit evidence regarding downgrading of impaired loans and declassification of accounts from non-performing to regular, as the case may be; - We performed independent checks for the computations of provisions in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations; - In addition, we selected individually significant corporate loans and a representative sample of borrowers from the credit portfolios across various branches, and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ unconsolidated financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Bank and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower; - Based on the said credit reviews, we identified and discussed with the management the loan accounts where the credit risk appears to have increased. We reviewed the adequacy of provisions against such accounts on the basis of our independent objective evaluation of the risk mitigating factors that exist in such cases; - In respect of the level of general provision maintained by the Bank, we discussed the approach and policy followed by the Bank with the management; and - We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9.4 and 9.5 to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing loans and provisions made for the same in the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

CORPORATE REPORTING

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated profit or loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated statement of cash flow (together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Omer Chughtai.

# 2.5.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at 31 December 2021. SBP via same circular has finalized the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

During the year, the management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 taking into account the SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. In addition, the Bank will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments.

An overview of the IFRS 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP:


356   BANK ALFALAH



# 2.5.1.1 Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will depend on how these are managed (the entity's business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Debt securities that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank's business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVPL'). Equity instruments are generally measured as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) unless the Bank elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) at initial recognition. The Bank has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

# Equity Securities

The Bank expects to continue measuring equity securities at fair value. For certain quoted equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. For those quoted equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will, instead, be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), with mark to market impacts recorded profit or loss for future periods. The AFS reserve related to those securities, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified from revaluation surplus/deficit to retained earnings, however, there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification. Unquoted equity securities are required to be measure at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation to the banks till one year to carry these investments under the current prudential regulation regime at lower of cost or breakup value.

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those which pass SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those which pass SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

# 2.5.1.2 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at Amortised Cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), loans and receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses ('ECL') resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL'). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in 'stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is an objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in 'stage 3'.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SCIR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default. Under the SBP's instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs' requirements.



CORPORATE REPORTING

# 2.5.1.3 Loan / financing related fee

Loan origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the lender for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related loan. However, if the commitment expires without the lender making the loan, the fee would be recognised as revenue as earned.

# 2.5.1.4 Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Bank's disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan is yet to issue a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from 1 January 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures of adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

# 2.5.1.5 Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

Based on the bank's assessment, the IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have an impact on the classification and measurement of some of its financial assets and financial liabilities.

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at 1 January 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 1,986.048 million, representing corresponding impact of:

1. Decrease of approximately Rs. 3,791.640 million related to impairment requirements; and
2. An increase of approximately Rs. 1,805.592 million related to classification and measurement requirements.

In light of current economic uncertainty, the management based on its assessment is carrying a general provision of Rs. 5,971.000 million against high risk advance portfolio and portfolio affected by flood. Under IFRS 9, this will continue to be carried as management overlay.

Cashflows of certain debt instruments classified in AFS or / and HTM categories, that fail SPPI test would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

# Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 will result in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which may impact lending and investment limits. In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the FIs to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting.

Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP have detailed the transitional arrangement. The transitional arrangement must apply only to provisions for stage 1 and 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the adjustment must be partially included (i.e. added back) to.

# The impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on the capital ratios of the Bank are as follows:

|                                                                          | As per adopted IFRS 9 | As per current ARS |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio                              | 9.47%                 | 9.51%              |
| Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio                                            | 11.05%                | 11.09%             |

# 2.6 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with approved accounting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgement in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgements were made by the management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. classification and provisioning against investments (notes 4.3.1, 4.3.5 and 8)
2. classification and provisioning against non-performing loans and advances (notes 4.4 and 9)
3. income taxes (notes 4.11 and 32)
4. accounting for defined benefit plan and compensated absences (notes 4.8, 36 and 38)
5. depreciation of operating fixed assets and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim (notes 4.5.2, 4.5.5 and 10)
6. amortisation of intangibles (notes 4.5.3 and 11)
7. revaluation of fixed assets and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim (note 4.5.2, 4.5.5, 10 and 13.1)
8. impairment of assets (note 4.12)
9. fair value measurement of financial instruments (note 40)
10. Provision against other assets and other provisions (notes 4.14 and 13.3)
11. Provision against off balance sheet obligations and contingent liabilities (notes 4.13, 4.15 and 18.1)
12. determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options (Bank as a lessee) (note 4.5.4.1, 10.3 and 18.2)
13. incremental borrowing rate (note 4.5.4.1)

# 4.3 Investments

# 4.3.1 Classification

The Bank classifies its investments as follows:

# Held for trading

# Held to maturity

These are investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities and the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold them till maturity.

# Available for sale

These are investments, other than those in subsidiaries and associates, which do not fall under the 'held for trading' and 'held to maturity' categories.

# Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Investment in associates is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

CORPORATE REPORTING


# 4.3.4 Subsequent measurement

In accordance with the requirements of State Bank of Pakistan, quoted securities other than those classified as 'held to maturity', investment in associates and subsidiaries are subsequently remeasured to market value. Surplus and deficit arising on revaluation of securities classified as 'available for sale' is taken to a separate account shown in the statement of financial position. Surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of investments classified as 'held for trading' is taken to the profit and loss account. Investments classified as 'held to maturity' are carried at amortised cost.

Unquoted equity securities, excluding investment in subsidiaries and associates are valued at lower of cost and the break-up value. Break-up value of equity securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. Investment in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost, less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Details of valuation techniques used in determination of fair value is included in note 40.1 of these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 4.3.5 Impairment

The Bank determines provision for diminution in the value of debt securities as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. When a debt security, other than a government security, is classified as available-for-sale and considered to be impaired, the balance in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account is transferred to the profit and loss account as an impairment charge. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases the impairment loss is reversed through the profit and loss account.

When a debt security, other than a government security, classified as held-to-maturity and considered to be impaired, the impairment is directly charged to the profit and loss account as held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the debt security is credited to the profit and loss account.

The Bank determines impairment on available-for-sale listed equity securities when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of these investments below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgement. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

A decline in the carrying value of unlisted equity securities is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

The carrying values of investments in associates and subsidiary are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amounts, higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use, the investments in associates are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is taken to profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the carrying value of the investment in associates and joint ventures, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision against investments by the overseas branches is made as per the requirements of the respective countries in which overseas branches operates.

# 4.4 Advances

# Loans and advances

Loans and advances including net investment in finance lease are stated net of provision against non-performing advances.

# Finance Lease Receivables

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised on commencement of lease term at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, including guaranteed residual value, if any. Unearned finance income is recognised over the term of the lease, so as to produce a constant periodic return on the outstanding net investment in lease.

The rental received/receivable on Ijarah under IFAS 2 are recorded as income/revenue. The Bank charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to Mustajir. Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Impairment of Ijarah rentals are determined in accordance with the Prudential Regulations of SBP. The provision for impairment of Ijarah Rentals is shown as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets'.

# 4.5 Fixed assets

# 4.5.1 Capital work in progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. All expenditure connected with specific assets incurred during installation and construction period are carried under this head. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

# 4.5.2 Property and Equipment (owned and leased)

Property and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, except land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is charged by applying the straight-line method using the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date. Depreciation on additions is charged from the date on which the assets are available for use and ceases on the date on which they are disposed off.

Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to income as and when incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers every three years to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value.

A revaluation surplus is recorded in OCI as part of surplus on revaluation of fixed asset in equity. However, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, the increase is recognised in profit and loss. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus. A transfer from the asset revaluation surplus to retained earnings is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the original cost.

Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the profit and loss account except that the related surplus/deficit on revaluation of operating fixed assets (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.5.3 Intangible assets

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives and amortisation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate at each reporting date. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost, less impairment loss, if any. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment, if any, as described under note 4.12.

# 4.5.4 Leases

The Bank assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# 4.5.4.1 Bank as a lessee

The Bank recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets over its lease term.

# Right-of-use (RoU) assets

At the commencement date of the lease, the right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of lease liability. Subsequently, RoU assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. RoU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

# Lease liability

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liability measured at the present value of the consideration (lease payments) to be made over the lease term and is adjusted for lease prepayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, unless it is not readily determinable, in which case the lessee may use the incremental rate of borrowing. After the commencement date, the carrying amount of lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

# Determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options (Bank as a lessee)

The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Bank has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Bank applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.

After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

# Incremental borrowing rate (IBR)

The IBR is the rate of markup that the Bank would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The Bank estimates the IBR using observable inputs such as market interest rates.

# 4.5.4.2 Bank as a lessor

Leases in which the Bank does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.

# 4.5.5 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation thereon. The valuation of properties acquired under this head is conducted as per SBP's requirement, so as to ensure that their net carrying value does not materially differ from their fair value. Any surplus arising on revaluation of such properties is transferred to the surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets in other comprehensive income, while any deficit arising on revaluation is charged to profit and loss account directly. Depreciation on assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on straight line method over the useful life of the assets. In addition, all direct costs, including legal fees and transfer costs linked with transferring the title of the property to bank is accounted as an expense in the profit and loss account.

| Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts | 6,903,292 | 4,823,035 |

These mainly represents counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as hypothecated / mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), damage to reputation and cases filed by ex. employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment. Based on legal advice and / or internal assessment, management is confident that the matters will be decided in Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these financial statements.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers' Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

# 36.14 Funding Policy

The bank's policy for funding the staff retirement benefit scheme is given in note 4.8 (a).

# 36.15 Risks Associated with Defined Benefit Plans

Asset Volatility:

The risk arises due to the inclusion of the risky assets in the gratuity fund portfolio, inflation and interest rate volatility.

Changes in Bond yields:

The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the plan assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

Inflation Risks:

The risk arises if gratuity benefits are linked to inflation and the inflation is higher than expected, which results in higher liabilities.

Life expectancy / withdrawal Risk:

The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

Longevity Risks:

The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Salary Increase Risk:

The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases in salary are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

# 37 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

# 40 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 40.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

CORPORATE REPORTING

40.2 The Bank's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer, occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current year.

40.3 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

- (a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non government debt securities.
- (b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.
- (c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3 except as disclosed in 40.3.1. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

40.3.1 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of fixed assets (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 10 and 13. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan.

# 45 RISK MANAGEMENT

The variety of business activities undertaken by the Bank require effective identification, measurement, monitoring, integration and management of different financial and non-financial risks that are constantly evolving as business activities change in response to concurrent internal and external developments. The Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) is appointed and authorized by the Board of Directors (BOD) to assist in design, regularly evaluate and timely updating the risk management framework of the Bank. The Board has further authorized management committees i.e. Central Management Committee (CMC), and Central Credit Committee (CCC) to supervise risk management activities within their respective scopes. CMC has further established sub-committees such as Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Investment Committee (IC), Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSC), Control & Compliance Committee (C&CC), Process Improvement Committee (PIC) and Board Crisis Management Committee.

The risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guideline to cater to changing business dynamics. The framework includes:

- Clearly defined risk management policies, procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities;
- Well constituted organizational structure, in the form of separate risk management departments within Credit and Risk Management Group, which ensures that individuals responsible for risk approval are independent from risk taking units i.e. Business Units;
- Mechanism for ongoing review of policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organization flows to ensure that risks are accurately identified & assessed, properly documented, approved, and adequately monitored & managed in order to enhance long-term stability. The risk management framework has a well-defined organizational structure for effective management of credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information security risk, trade pricing, environment and social risk. Further, there is an advanced focus on optimal utilization of capital while ensuring compliance with capital requirements. The results of stress tests and internal capital adequacy assessment process are given due consideration in capital and business planning.

# 45.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Bank due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from lending, hedging, settlement and other financial transactions. Credit risk management processes encompass identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and control of Bank's exposure to credit risk. The credit risk management philosophy is based on overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Bank is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analyzed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities and appropriately quantified, also ensuring that the credit commitment is appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices) and documented.

The Bank has built and maintained a sound loan portfolio in terms of well-defined credit policy approved by the Board of Directors (BOD). Its credit evaluation system comprises of well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and review procedures for the purpose of emphasizing prudence in lending activities and ensuring the high quality of asset portfolio. In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with Business, Credit Division has separate units for Corporate banking, Islamic banking, Retail & SME banking, Agricultural financing, and Overseas Operations. For Consumer & Digital products, loans are booked against defined eligibility criteria as per product programs and they have separate credit risk unit.

The Bank manages its portfolio of loan assets with a view to limit concentrations in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity and large exposure. Internal rating based portfolio analysis is also conducted on regular basis. This portfolio level oversight is maintained by Credit & Risk Management Group.

For domestic operations, the Bank determines the amount for specific and general provisions as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and management estimates. Provisions at overseas branches are held to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which overseas branches operates.

A sophisticated internal credit rating system is in place, which is capable of quantifying counter-party and transaction risk in accordance with the best practices. The risk rating system takes into consideration qualitative and quantitative factors of the counter-party, transaction structure & security and generates internal ratings at obligor and facility levels. The facility rating system, developed in line with guidelines, also provides expected LGD (Loss Given Default). This has been implemented for Corporate, Islamic and Retail portfolio. Furthermore, this system has an integrated loan origination module, which is currently being used in Corporate Banking, Islamic Banking and Retail segments. The system is regularly reviewed for improvements as per SBP's guidelines for Internal Credit Rating and Risk Management. Furthermore, Bank has also automated Internal Rating validation process based on statistical tests for Corporate, Commercial, Medium Enterprise, Small Enterprise and Agri rating models. It covers both discrimination and calibration statistical tests as per best practices. The system is backed by secured database with backup support and is capable of generating MIS reports providing snapshot of the entire portfolio for strategizing and decision making. The system is enhanced to compute the ECL calculation for IFRS 9 & risk weighted assets for the quarterly credit risk related Basel submissions.

A centralized Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Credit & Risk Management Group is working towards ensuring that terms of approval of credit sanctions and regulatory stipulations are complied, all documentation including security documentation is regular and fully enforceable and all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorization by CAD.

Credit Policy & Portfolio Management under Credit & Risk Management Group keeps a watch on the quality of the credit portfolio in terms of borrowers' behaviour, identifies weakening accounts relationships and reports it to the appropriate authorities with a view to address further deterioration.

To handle the specialized requirements of managing delinquent and problem accounts, the Bank has a separate client facing unit to negotiate repayment/ settlement of the non-performing exposure and protect the interests of the depositors and stakeholders. The priority of the Special Asset Management Group (SAMG) is recovery of funds and/or to structure an arrangement (such as rescheduling, restructuring, settlement or a combination of these) by which the interests of the Bank are protected. Where no other recourse is possible, SAMG may proceed with legal recourse so as to maximize the recovery of the assets. The Credit & Risk Management Group also monitors the NPL portfolio of the Bank and reports the same to CCC/ BRMC.

# 45.1.1 Credit Risk - General Disclosures Basel Specific

The Bank is using Standardized Approach (SA) of SBP Basel accord for the purpose of estimating Credit Risk Weighted Assets. Under SA, banks are allowed to take into consideration external rating(s) of counter-parties for the purpose of calculating Risk Weighted Assets. A detailed procedural manual specifying processes for deriving Credit Risk Weighted Assets in accordance with the SBP Basel Standardized Approach is in place and firmly adhered to.

# 45.1.2 Disclosures for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach & Supervisory risk weights

# 45.1.2.1 External ratings

SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and Moodys, Fitch and Standard & Poors. The State Bank of Pakistan through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Bank for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Bank uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate and banks incorporated in Bangladesh. The Bank uses external ratings for the purposes of computing the risk weights as per the Basel III framework. Where exposure is rated by two or more ratings agencies - the lowest rating is considered.

# 45.1.3 Disclosures with respect to Credit Risk Mitigation for Standardised Approach

# 45.1.3.1 Credit risk mitigation policy

The Bank defines collateral as the assets or rights provided to the Bank by the borrower or a third party in order to secure a credit facility. The Bank would have the rights of secured creditor in respect of the assets / contracts offered as security for the obligations of the borrower / obligor.

# 45.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel II / III guidelines, the Bank uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Bank reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel III guidelines. In line with Basel II / III guidelines, the Bank makes adjustments in eligible collaterals received for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral in line with the requirements specified by SBP guidelines. These adjustments, also referred to as to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

# 45.1.3.3 Types of collaterals

The Bank determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenor loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the Bank. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the security of the property and automobile being financed respectively. The Bank also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining. The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorization approved by the Central Credit Committee (CCC) under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

# 45.1.3.4 Types of eligible financial collateral

For credit risk mitigation purposes (capital adequacy purposes), the Bank considers all types of financial collaterals that are eligible under SBP Basel III accord. This includes cash / TDRs, gold, securities issued by Government of Pakistan such as T-Bills and PIBs, National Savings Certificates, certain debt securities rated by recognised credit rating agencies, mutual fund units where daily Net Asset Value (NAV) is available in public domain and guarantees from certain specified entities (Government of Pakistan, Banks etc.) under substitution effect of Basel.

# 45.1.3.5  Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Bank to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category). Concentration in customers that are rated in high risk category is also monitored against the approved appetite set by the management.

Particulars of bank's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk in various sectors are analysed as follows:

# 45.2 Market Risk

Market risk exposes the Bank to the risk of financial losses resulting from movements in market prices. It is the risk associated with changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. To manage and control market risk, a comprehensive Board approved Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy, is in place. The policy outlines a well-defined risk control structure, responsibilities of relevant stakeholders with respect to market risk management and methods to measure and control market risk at a portfolio level. Furthermore, it includes controls which are applied, where necessary, to individual risk types, to particular books and to specific exposures. These controls include limits on exposure to individual market risk variables as well as limits on concentrations of tenors. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.

Under the BoD approved policy, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee (IC) are primarily responsible for the oversight of market risk, supported by Market & Liquidity Risk Department of Risk Management Division (RMD). The Bank uses the Standardized Approach to calculate capital charge for market risk as per the current regulatory framework under Basel II / III. Furthermore, the Bank carries out risk assessment via diversified tools including Value at Risk (VaR), PV01 (price value per basis point) and Duration on a regular basis. The Bank also ascertains the impact of market risk on relevant portfolios through stress testing and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment processes.

# 45.3 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates. FX risk is mainly managed through matched positions.

The Bank manages FX risk by setting and monitoring dealer and currency-wise limits. Currency risk is regulated and monitored against regulatory limits enforced by the State Bank of Pakistan. FX limits in respective currencies are managed against the prescribed limits. Risk Assessment with respect to FX risk is conducted on a regular basis through VaR analysis.

The analysis below represents the concentration of the Bank's foreign currency risk for on and off balance sheet financial instruments:

# 45.3.2 Equity position Risk

Equity position risk arises due to adverse movements in the prices of equities and instruments exhibiting behaviour similar to equities held by the bank. The equity investments are classified as Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) investments. The objective of classifying investments as HFT is to take advantage of short term capital gains, while the AFS portfolio is maintained with a medium term view of capital gains and dividend income. The Investment Committee is primarily responsible for the oversight of the equity investment risk. Market Risk Unit of RMD monitors portfolio and scrip level internal and regulatory limits. The Bank also has dealer and management limits in place.

# 45.5 Operational Risk

Basel II defines Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Operational Risk Management Framework, policy and Standards of the Bank duly approved by the Central Management Committee and the Board, cover the processes, structure and functions of operational risk management and provides guidelines to identify, assess, monitor, control and report operational risk in a consistent and transparent manner across the Bank.

# 45.5.1 Operational Risk Disclosures - Basel II Specific

The Bank is among the first few banks in the industry to secure SBP approval for adoption of Alternative Standardized Approach (ASA) under Basel II for determining capital charge on operational risk in December 2013. The Bank started calculating its capital charge for operational risk using ASA from December 31, 2013.

The SBP approval stipulated a capital floor i.e. operational risk charge under ASA should not fall below as a certain percentage of operational risk capital charge calculated under Basic Indicator Approach for initial three years. These floors were 90% for 2013 and 2014, 80% for 2015 and 70% for 2016. However, removal of capital floor for calculation of capital charge under ASA was extended in line with international developments and consultations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Bank and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System) for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. We aim to implement a new process based Risk and Control Self-Assessment method across the Bank in order to effectively manage operational risks and continually monitor the effectiveness of defined controls through first line self-assessment reviews, especially for the processes and activities that may significantly impact the risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# 45.5.2 Information Security Risk

The Bank has in place an Information Security Risk Management Policy and an IT Management Policy, duly approved by the Board of Directors, which derive from the regulatory mandates and the ISO 27001:2013 international standards framework. A dedicated Information Security Division, functioning within Credit & Risk Management Group manages information security risks to technology assets by developing Information security baselines for IT solutions that support products and services; security solutions selection, and acquisition including vendor and/or service provider selection managed by Information Security in close coordination with ITG and procurement/central administration; monitoring of threats and vulnerabilities though Security Operations Centre( 24/7 ); investigation of reported information security incidents; reinforcement of Information security risk awareness to employees via periodic communications; following up on due dates with stakeholders responsible for remediation of open issues; and reporting the status of Information security risk to the management and Board IT Committee(BITC)/Information Technology Steering Committee(ITSC)/Board.

# 45.5.3 Environmental Risk

The Bank has integrated sustainable finance approach in its lending activities. In this regard, Green Banking Policy and Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) have been put in place.

The ESMS Framework essentially requires that any relevant lending opportunity is to be reviewed and evaluated under:

- International Finance Corporation exclusion list;
- Applicable national laws on environment, health, safety and social issues; and
- International Finance Corporation performance standards.

This framework is an integral part of the credit approval process. All relevant credit proposals require Environmental & Social review prior to approval of the competent authority.

On 9th November, 2022 State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. Bank Alfalah is currently aligning its procedures and policy with the afore-mentioned SBP manual.

# 45.5.4 Country risk

Country risk refers to the possibility that economic and political conditions in a foreign country could adversely impact the exposure in that country. For the Bank, country risk arises as a result of the net investment in foreign operations, foreign currency lending, trade and treasury business with counterparties domiciled in other countries as well as investments and capital transactions. In order to manage the risk, Bank has in place a comprehensive country risk management framework. Under this framework, the transfer risk is measured using financial market and economic factors. Political risk is measured using a variety of indicia indicative of willingness to honour its foreign obligations. Based on this framework, risk limits are assigned to countries within the Board approved limits. The limits and their utilization are monitored and managed at head office level and country risk exposures are reported to the relevant committees at a defined frequency.

# 45.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity is a financial capacity to meet its obligations as they fall due without incurring losses. Liquidity risk is the risk to an earnings, capital and reputation arising from its inability (real or perceived) to meet its contractual obligations in a timely manner without incurring unacceptable losses when they come due.

With reference to SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD circular # 08 dated June 23, 2016, the Bank calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis. Based on December 31, 2022 numbers LCR is 2.09 or 2.09% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 890,242.245 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 424,966.701 million.

Moreover, under the same circular the Banks are expected to calculate Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) on quarterly basis. Based on December 31, 2022 numbers the NSFR is 1.50 or 150% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 1,275,978.211 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 849,343.576 million.

The Bank manages and controls liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which includes BoD approved policy, management level procedural document and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) level guidelines. Under this framework, various liquidity metrics are implemented and monitored on a regular basis.

The Board approves the overall liquidity risk appetite and broad liquidity risk strategy through Annual Business Plan. The ALCO is primarily responsible for the implementation of Board's strategy through oversight of the asset liability function including liquidity management. Treasury front office manages the liquidity on day to day basis and is the first line of defence against liquidity risk. Under Risk Management Division, Liquidity Risk Management Unit is responsible for independent.

The overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversification and stability. The Bank has a diverse funding base, which includes stable funding in the form of equity, sub-ordinated loans, retail and small business deposits and non-stable funding in form of large volume depositors. The Bank has in place internally approved limits to monitor and manage risk emanating from volatile funding concentration. Moreover, the Bank is fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR, which ensure sufficient stock of high quality liquidity assets in relation to its liability profile.

Stress testing is used in an attempt to highlight the vulnerability of the balance sheet to hypothetical stress events and scenarios. Under the same, liquidity risk factors are given major shocks and their resulting impact on the balance sheet is calculated. The Bank carries out the stress testing based on SBP stress tests and internal defined scenarios to gauge the potential impacts of different liquidity stress scenarios on the stock of liquid assets. The results are shared with the senior management, BoD and the regulator.

At the Bank, Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), is implemented to address liquidity issues in times of stress / crises situations. The Treasury division prepares the CFPs for all operations on annual basis for identifying the stress scenarios and the funding plan for such scenarios along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division and are approved by the ALCO annually.

Main drivers of LCR results are High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow. HQLA is defined by the liquidity quality of the assets and net cash outflow is mainly determined through volatility of the liability profile. The table below showcases the composition of HQLA as of December 31, 2022.

| HQLA\*          | Market Value | Weighted Amount |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Level 1 Assets  | 884,736,343  | 884,736,343     |
| Level 2A Assets | 2,123,715    | 1,805,158       |
| Level 2B Assets | 7,260,282    | 3,700,744       |
| Total           |              | 890,242,245     |

* These have been defined in detail in SBP Circular No. 08, dated June 23, 2016.

# DISCLOSURES PLS POOL MANAGEMENT- ISLAMIC BANKING GROUP (IBG)

# A-II.2

1. The pools, their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The profit and loss sharing between the Rabbul Maal (depositor) and Mudarib (Bank - IBG) is based upon the underlying principles of Mudaraba, where Bank also contributes its equity to general pool of funds, and becomes the capital provider.

Currently IBG is managing following pools:

1. General pool for LCY depositors
2. FCY pool for foreign currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs pool for treasury purposes
4. IERS pool for islamic export refinance scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Advances, Investments, and Placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the weightage system.

The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under SBP IERS scheme.

The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

2. Avenues/sectors where Mudaraba based deposits have been deployed.

| Provision against Non-Performing Credit Exposure (Refer note 9.5 to the consolidated financial statements) | The Group’s credit portfolios include loans and advances, and non-funded credit facilities. The credit portfolio is spread across various domestic branches and overseas operations. As per the Group’s accounting policy (refer note 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements), the Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its provisions against non-performing credit exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan. Such regulations require specific provisioning against loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Group’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision against certain vulnerable corporate loans, therefore, involves use of management judgment, on a case-to-case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Group. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the consolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of loan loss provision as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter. We applied a range of audit procedures including the following: - We reviewed the Group’s process for identification and classification of non-performing loans including the quality of underlying data and systems. As part of such review we performed an analysis of the changes within the different categories of classified non-performing accounts from last year to the current reporting date. This analysis was used to gather audit evidence regarding downgrading of impaired loans and declassification of accounts from non-performing to regular, as the case may be; - We performed independent checks for the computations of provisions in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations; - In addition, we selected individually significant corporate loans and a representative sample of borrowers from the credit portfolios across various branches, and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ unconsolidated financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Group and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower; - Based on the said credit reviews, we identified and discussed with the management the loan accounts where the credit risk appears to have increased. We reviewed the adequacy of provisions against such accounts on the basis of our independent objective evaluation of the risk mitigating factors that exist in such cases; - In respect of the level of general provision maintained by the Group, we discussed the approach and policy followed by the Group with the management; and - We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9.4 and 9.5 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing loans and provisions made for the same in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022 449

# CORPORATE REPORTING

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Omer Chughtai.

# 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation

Subsidiary are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with investee and has the ability to affect those return through its power to direct activities of the investee.

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the balances and transactions of subsidiaries from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Profit or loss and each component of the OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the Holding Company and to the non-controlling interests (NCI) even if it results in the NCI having a deficit balance.

Material Intra-group balances and transactions with subsidiaries are eliminated.

A change in ownership of a subsidiary, without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.

Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiaries attributable to interests which are not owned by the Holding Company.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control over, the financial and operating policies. Associates are accounted for using the equity method.

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to the unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.3.2

The Holding company believes that there is no significant doubt on the Holding ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.

# 2.5.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at 31 December 2021. SBP via same circular has finalized the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

The subsidiary and certain associates have already adopted IFRS 9 in previous years or are exempted from the same. The adoption of IFRS 9 at the Group level will not have an effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and investment in associates included in these financial statements.

During the 2022, the management of the Holding Company has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 taking into account the SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. In addition, the Holding Company will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

An overview of the IFRS 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP:

# 2.5.1.1 Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will depend on how these are managed (the entity's business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Debt securities that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Holding Company's business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVPL'). Equity instruments are generally measured as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) unless the Holding Company elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) at initial recognition. The Holding Company has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

The Holding Company expects to continue measuring equity securities at fair value. For certain quoted equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Holding Company will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

For those quoted equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will, instead, be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), with mark to market impacts recorded profit or loss for future periods. The AFS reserve related to those securities, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified from revaluation surplus/deficit to retained earnings, however, there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measure at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation to the banks till one year to carry these investments under the current prudential regulation regime at lower of cost or breakup value.

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those which pass SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those which pass SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

# 2.5.1.2 Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at Amortised Cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), loans and receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses ('ECL') resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL'). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in 'stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is an objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in 'stage 3'.

# CORPORATE REPORTING

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Holding Company has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SCIR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default.

Under the SBP's instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs' requirements.

# 2.5.1.3 Loan / financing related fee

Loan origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the lender for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related loan. However, if the commitment expires without the lender making the loan, the fee would be recognised as revenue as earned.

# 2.5.1.4 Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Holding Company's disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan is yet to issue a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from 1 January 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures of adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

# 2.5.1.5 Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Holding financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Holding Company would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Holding Company has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

Based on the Holding Company's assessment, the IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have an impact on the classification and measurement of some of its financial assets and financial liabilities.

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Holding Company's equity at 1 January 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 1,986.048 million, representing corresponding impact of:

1. Decrease of approximately Rs. 3,791.640 million related to impairment requirements; and
2. An increase of approximately Rs. 1,805.592 million related to classification and measurement requirements.

In light of current economic uncertainty, the management based on its assessment is carrying a general provision of Rs. 5,971.000 million against high risk advance portfolio and portfolio affected by flood. Under IFRS 9, this will continue to be carried as management overlay.

Certain debt instruments classified in AFS or / and HTM categories, that fail SPPI test would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

# Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 will result in reduction in regulatory capital of the Banks, which may impact lending and investment limits. In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the FIs to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the 'Application Instructions' issued by SBP have detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement must apply only to provisions for stage 1 and 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the adjustment must be partially included (i.e. added back) to

# 2.6 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with approved accounting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgement in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The credit price is agreed at the time of sale and such proceeds are received at the end of the credit period. The difference between the deferred payment amount receivable and the carrying value at the time of sale is accrued and recorded as income over the life of the transaction.

# Bai Muajjal Sale

The credit price is agreed at the time of purchase and the proceeds are paid at the end of the credit period. The difference between the deferred payment amount payable and the carrying value at the time of purchase is accrued and recorded as borrowing cost over the life of the transaction.

# 4.3 Investments

# 4.3.1 Classification

The Group classifies its investments as follows:

- Held for trading: These are investments, which are either acquired for generating profits from short-term fluctuations in market prices, interest rate movements, dealers' margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists.
- Held to maturity: These are investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities and the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold them till maturity.
- Available for sale: These are investments which do not fall under the 'held for trading' and 'held to maturity' categories.
- Associates: Under the Equity accounting method, investments in associates are initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount of investment is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the post acquisition profits or losses in income and its share of the post acquisition movement in reserves. The aggregate of Group's share of profit or loss of an associate is shown in profit or loss account as share of profit. Any change in OCI of the investees is presented as part of Group's OCI to the extent of share in other comprehensive income/loss. Dividends from associates are eliminated from the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between Group and associates are eliminated.



CORPORATE REPORTING

# 4.3.2 Regular way contracts

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognised at trade date, which is the date at which the Group commits to purchase or sell the investments.

# 4.3.3 Initial recognition and measurement

Investments are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs associated with investments other than held for trading securities are included in cost of investments. Transaction costs on held for trading securities are expensed in the profit and loss account.

# 4.3.4 Subsequent measurement

In accordance with the requirements of State Bank of Pakistan, quoted securities other than those classified as 'held to maturity', investment in associates and subsidiaries are subsequently remeasured to market value. Surplus and deficit arising on revaluation of securities classified as 'available for sale' is taken to a separate account shown in the statement of financial position. Surplus / (deficit) arising on revaluation of investments classified as 'held for trading' is taken to the profit and loss account. Investments classified as 'held to maturity' are carried at amortised cost.

Unquoted equity securities, excluding investment in associates are valued at lower of cost and the break-up value. Break-up value of equity securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. Investment in associates are carried at cost, less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Details of valuation techniques used in determination of fair value is included in note 41.1 of these consolidated financial statements.

# 4.3.5 Impairment

The Holding Company determines provision for diminution in the value of debt securities as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. When a debt security, other than a government security, is classified as available-for-sale and considered to be impaired, the balance in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account is transferred to the profit and loss account as an impairment charge. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases the impairment loss is reversed through the profit and loss account. When a debt security, other than government security classified as held-to-maturity and considered to be impaired, the impairment is directly charged to the profit and loss account as held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the debt security is credited to the profit and loss account.

The Holding Company determines impairment on available-for-sale listed equity securities when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of these investments below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgement. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

A decline in the carrying value of unlisted equity securities is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

The Group considers that a decline in the recoverable value of its investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amounts, higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use, the investments in associates are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is taken to profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in associates and joint ventures, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision against investments by the overseas branches is made as per the requirements of the respective countries in which overseas branches operates.

# 4.4 Advances

# Loans and advances

Loans and advances including net investment in finance lease are stated net of provision against non-performing advances. Specific and general provisions against loans and advances in Pakistan operations are made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time and management assumptions. General reserve against high risk and flood impacted advances portfolio is based on management's estimates as disclosed in note 9.6.5 (iv). The net provision made / reversed during the year is charged to profit and loss account and accumulated provision is netted-off against advances. Provisions pertaining to overseas loans and advances are made in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries. Advances are written off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery or to clean up the balance sheet as allowed by SBP circular no. 06 of 2007 dated June 05, 2007.

# Islamic Financing and Related Assets

The Holding Company provides Islamic and related assets mainly through Murabaha, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Salam, Istisna, Tijara and Export under SBP Islamic Export Scheme. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not in these statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of thereon. The income on such is recognised in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. The Holding Company determines specific and general provisions against Islamic and related assets on a prudent basis in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and management estimates/assumption.

Islamic and related assets are written off when there are no realistic prospects of recovery or to clean up the books.

# Finance Lease Receivables

Leases where the Holding Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised on commencement of lease term at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, including guaranteed residual value, if any. Unearned finance income is recognised over the term of the lease, so as to produce a constant periodic return on the outstanding net investment in lease. The Holding Company determines specific provisions against investment in finance lease on a prudent basis in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and management estimates/assumption. The net provision made / reversed during the year is charged to and loss account and accumulated provision is netted off against net investment in finance lease.

# Ijarah Assets (IFAS 2)

Ijarah assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are disclosed as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets'. The rental received/ receivable on Ijarah under IFAS 2 are recorded as income / revenue. The Holding Company charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to Mustajir. Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Impairment of Ijarah rentals are determined in accordance with the Prudential Regulations of SBP. The provision for impairment of Ijarah Rentals is shown as part of 'Islamic financing and related assets'.

# 4.5 Fixed assets

# 4.5.1 Capital work in progress

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. All expenditure connected with specific assets incurred during installation and construction period are carried under this head. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

# 4.5.2 Property and Equipment (owned and leased)

Property and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, except land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is charged by applying the straight-line method using the rates specified in note 10.2 to these consolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date. Depreciation on additions is charged from the date on which the assets are available for use and ceases on the date on which they are disposed off. Maintenance and normal repairs are charged to income as and when incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers every three years to ensure that the net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value.


ANNUAL REPORT 2022 463


CORPORATE REPORTING

A revaluation surplus is recorded in OCI and credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed asset in equity. However, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, the increase is recognised in profit and loss. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the asset revaluation surplus. A transfer from the asset revaluation surplus to retained earnings is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the original cost. Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are taken to the profit and loss account except that the related surplus / deficit on revaluation of operating fixed assets (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.5.3 Intangible assets

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives and amortisation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate at each reporting date. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at acquisition cost, less impairment loss, if any. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment, if any, as described under note 4.12.

# 4.5.4 Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# 4.5.4.1 Group as a lessee

The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Right-of-use (RoU) assets

At the commencement date of the lease, the right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of lease liability. Subsequently, RoU assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. RoU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

# Lease liability

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liability measured at the present value of the consideration (lease payments) to be made over the lease term and is adjusted for lease prepayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, unless it is not readily determinable, in which case the lessee may use the incremental rate of borrowing. After the commencement date, the carrying amount of lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

# Determination of the lease term for lease contracts with renewal and termination options (Group as a lessee)

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.

After the commencement date, the Holding Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

# Incremental borrowing rate (IBR)

The IBR is the rate of markup that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs such as market interest rates.

# 4.5.4.2 Group as a lessor

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.

# 4.5.5 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation thereon. The valuation of properties acquired under this head is conducted as per SBP's requirement, so as to ensure that their net carrying value does not materially differ from their fair value. Any surplus arising on revaluation of such properties is transferred to the surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets in other comprehensive income, while any deficit arising on revaluation is charged to profit and loss account directly. Depreciation on assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on straight line method over the useful life of the assets. In addition, all direct costs, including legal fees and transfer costs linked with transferring the title of the property to Holding Company is accounted as an expense in the profit and loss account.

# 4.6 Deposits / Borrowings and their cost

a) Borrowings and deposits are recorded at the proceeds received.

b) Cost of deposits and borrowings are recognised as an expense in the period in which these are incurred using effective mark-up / interest rate method to the extent that they are not directly attributable to the acquisition of or construction of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

c) Swap cost arises when surplus foreign currency funds are sold to purchase local currency funds from the market. Swap cost is recorded as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

# 4.6.1 Deposits - Islamic Banking

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Modaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current Account' and Deposits generated on Modaraba basis are classified as 'Savings Account' and 'Fixed Deposit Accounts'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors. Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. Rab-ul-Maal (Customer) share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Mudarib (The Holding Company) can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal upto a specified percentage of its profit. Profits are distributed from the pool so the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. Asset pools are created at the Holding Company's discretion and the holding company can add, amend, transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments.

# 4.7 Subordinated debts

Subordinated loans are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received. Mark-up accrued on subordinated loans is recognised separately as part of other liabilities and is charged to the profit and loss account over the period on an accrual basis.




# 4.8 Staff retirement / Employee benefits

# a) Defined benefit plan

The Holding Company operates an approved funded gratuity scheme, administered by the trustees, covering eligible employees whose period of employment with Holding Company is five years or more. Contributions to the fund are made on the basis of actuarial recommendations. Projected Unit Credit Method is used for the actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuations involve assumption and estimates of discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases and future inflation rates as disclosed in note 37.1.3. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

The Subsidiary - Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited operates an unfunded gratuity scheme for all its employees who have completed the qualifying period as defined in the scheme. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial (remeasurement) gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in full in the year in which they occur in other comprehensive income.

# b) Defined contribution plan

The Holding Company operates an approved provident fund scheme for all its regular permanent employees, administered by the Trustees. The Holding Company contribute 8.33% of basic salary in equal monthly contributions. However, employees have the option, to have their provident fund contribution deducted at 8.33%, 10% or 12% of their monthly basic salary.

# c) Compensated absences

The Holding Company recognises the liability for compensated absences in respect of employees in the period in which these are earned up to the balance sheet date. The provision is recognised on the basis of actuarial recommendations.

# d) Share Based Payment

The Holding Company has granted a cash award equivalent to the ordinary shares allotted to certain employees under Phantom Shares Award. The entitlement shall vest with the employees in three (3) equivalent proportions on the vesting dates over a period of three (3) years. The grant date is January 1, 2021 and the first vesting date is 365 calendar days from the grant date. Subsequently, second and third vesting dates to follow 365 calendar days from the preceding vesting dates. On each vesting date, the employees shall be entitled to a cash award for 33.33% (thirty-three and one third of one percent) of the total Phantom Shares Entitlement equivalent to fair market value of the Holding Company's share on vesting date.

When the options are exercised, employee stock option compensation reserve relating to these options is transferred to share capital and share premium. An amount equivalent to the face value of related shares is transferred to share capital. Any amount over and above the share capital is transferred to share premium.

The Holding Company recognises compensation expense with corresponding liability at the fair value of the award. Until the liability is settled, the Holding Company re-measures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period.

# 37.1.16 Funding Policy

The Holding Company's policy for funding the staff retirement benefit scheme, is given in note 4.8 (a).

# 37.1.17 Risks Associated with Defined Benefit Plans

Asset Volatility

The risk arises due to the inclusion of the risky assets in the gratuity fund portfolio, inflation and interest rate volatility.

Changes in Bond yields

The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the plan assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

Inflation Risks

The risk arises if gratuity benefits are linked to inflation and the inflation is higher than expected, which results in higher liabilities.

Life expectancy / Withdrawal Risk:

The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

Longevity Risks:

The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

# Salary Increase Risk:

The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases in salary are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.

# CORPORATE REPORTING

# 41 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# CORPORATE REPORTING

# 41.2

The Group's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer, occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the current year.

# 41.3

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# (a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non government debt securities.

# (b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.

# (c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3 except as disclosed in note 41.3.1. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 41.3.1

Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of fixed assets (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 10 and 13. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan.

# 46 RISK MANAGEMENT

The variety of business activities undertaken by the Group require effective identification, measurement, monitoring, integration and management of different financial and non-financial risks that are constantly evolving as business activities change in response to concurrent internal and external developments. The Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) is appointed and authorized by the Board of Directors (BOD) to assist in design, regularly evaluate and timely updating the risk management framework of the Holding Company. The Board has further authorized management committees i.e. Central Management Committee (CMC), and Central Credit Committee (CCC) to supervise risk management activities within their respective scopes. CMC has further established sub-committees such as Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO), Investment Committee (IC), Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSC), Control & Compliance Committee (C&CC), Process Improvement Committee (PIC) and Board Crisis Management Committee.

The risk management framework endeavours to be a comprehensive and evolving guideline to cater to changing business dynamics. The framework includes:

- Clearly defined risk management policies, procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities;
- Well constituted organizational structure, in the form of separate risk management departments within Credit and Risk Management Group, which ensures that individuals responsible for risk approval are independent from risk taking units i.e. Business Units; and
- Mechanism for ongoing review of policies and procedures and risk exposures.

The primary objective of this architecture is to inculcate risk management into the organization flows to ensure that risks are accurately identified & assessed, properly documented, approved, and adequately monitored & managed in order to enhance long term earnings and to protect the interests of the depositors and shareholders.

The Holding Company's risk management framework has a well-defined organizational structure for effective management of credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information security risk, trade pricing, environment and social risk. Further, there is an advanced focus on optimal utilization of capital while ensuring compliance with capital requirements. The results of stress tests and internal capital adequacy assessment process are given due consideration in capital and business planning.

# 46.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the identification of probability that counterparty will cause a financial loss to the Holding Company due to its inability or unwillingness to meet its contractual obligation. This credit risk arises mainly from lending, hedging, settlement and other financial transactions. Credit risk management processes encompass overall business strategy / direction as established by the Board. The Group is committed to the appropriate level of due diligence to ensure that credit risks have been properly analyzed, fully disclosed to the approving authorities and appropriately quantified, also ensuring that the credit commitment is appropriately structured, priced (in line with market practices) and documented.

The Holding Company has built and maintained a sound loan portfolio in terms of well-defined credit policy approved by the Board of Directors (BOD). Its credit evaluation system comprises of well-designed credit appraisal, sanctioning and review procedures for the purpose of emphasizing prudence in lending activities and ensuring the high quality of asset portfolio. In order to have an effective and efficient risk assessment, and to closely align its functions with Business, Credit Division has separate units for Corporate banking, Islamic banking, Retail & SME banking, Agricultural financing, and Overseas Operations. For Consumer & Digital products, loans are booked against defined eligibility criteria as per product programs and they have separate credit risk unit.

The Holding Company manages its portfolio of loan assets with a view to limit concentrations in terms of risk quality, industry, maturity and large exposure. Internal rating based portfolio analysis is also conducted on regular basis. This portfolio level oversight is maintained by Credit & Risk Management Group.

For domestic operations, the Holding Company determines the amount for specific and general provisions as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and management estimates. Provisions at overseas branches are held to meet the requirements of regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which overseas branches operates.

A sophisticated internal credit rating system is in place, which is capable of quantifying counter-party and transaction risk in accordance with the best practices. The risk rating system takes into consideration qualitative and quantitative factors of the counter-party, transaction structure & security and generates internal ratings at obligor and facility levels. The facility rating system, developed in line with guidelines, also provides expected LGD (Loss Given Default). This has been implemented for Corporate, Islamic and Retail portfolio. Furthermore, this system has an integrated loan origination module, which is currently being used in Corporate Banking, Islamic Banking and Retail segments. The system is regularly reviewed for improvements as per SBP's guidelines for Internal Credit Rating and Risk Management. Furthermore, the Holding Company has also automated Internal Rating validation process based on statistical tests for Corporate, Commercial, Medium Enterprise, Small Enterprise and Agri rating models. It covers both discrimination and calibration statistical tests as per best practices. The system is backed by secured database with backup support and is capable of generating MIS reports providing snapshot of the entire portfolio for strategizing and decision making. The system is enhanced to compute the ECL calculation for IFRS 9 & risk weighted assets for the quarterly credit risk related Basel submissions.

CORPORATE REPORTING

A centralized Credit Administration Division (CAD) under Credit & Risk Management Group is working towards ensuring that terms of approval of credit sanctions and regulatory stipulations are complied, all documentation including security documentation is regular and fully enforceable and all disbursements of approved facilities are made only after necessary authorization by CAD.

Credit Policy & Portfolio Management under Credit & Risk Management Group keeps a watch on the quality of the credit portfolio in terms of borrowers' behaviour, identifies weakening accounts relationships and reports it to the appropriate authorities with a view to address further deterioration.

To handle the specialized requirements of managing delinquent and problem accounts, the Holding Company has a separate client facing unit to negotiate repayment/ settlement of the non-performing exposure and protect the interests of the Holding depositors and stakeholders. The priority of the Special Asset Management Group (SAMG) is recovery of funds and/or to structure an arrangement (such as rescheduling, restructuring, settlement or a combination of these) by which the interests of the Bank are protected. Where no other recourse is possible, SAMG may proceed with legal recourse so as to maximize the recovery of the Holding.

# 46.1.1 Credit Risk - General Disclosures Basel Specific

The Holding Company is using Standardized Approach (SA) of SBP Basel accord for the purpose of estimating Credit Risk Weighted Assets. Under SA, banks are allowed to take into consideration external rating(s) of counter-parties for the purpose of calculating Risk Weighted Assets. A detailed procedural manual specifying processes for deriving Credit Risk Weighted Assets in accordance with the SBP Basel Standardized Approach is in place and firmly adhered to.

# 46.1.2 Disclosures for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach & Supervisory risk weights

# 46.1.2.1 External ratings

SBP Basel III guidelines require banks to use ratings assigned by specified External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) namely Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) and Moodys, Fitch and Standard & Poors.

The State Bank of Pakistan through its letter number BSD/BAI-2/201/1200/2009 dated December 21, 2009 accorded approval to the Holding Company for use of ratings assigned by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) and Credit Rating Information and Services Limited (CRISL). The Holding Company uses these ECAIs to rate its exposures denominated in Bangladeshi currency on certain corporate and banks incorporated in Bangladesh.

The Holding Company uses external ratings for the purposes of computing the risk weights as per the Basel III framework. Where exposure is rated by two or more ratings agencies - the lowest rating is considered.

# 46.1.3 Disclosures with respect to Credit Risk Mitigation for Standardised Approach

# 46.1.3.1 Credit risk mitigation policy

The Holding Company defines collateral as the assets or rights provided to the Holding Company by the borrower or a third party in order to secure a credit facility. The Holding Company would have the rights of secured creditor in respect of the assets / contracts offered as security for the obligations of the borrower / obligor.

# 46.1.3.2 Collateral valuation and management

As stipulated in the SBP Basel II / III guidelines, the Bank uses the comprehensive approach for collateral valuation. Under this approach, the Holding Company reduces its credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel III guidelines. In line with Basel II / III guidelines, the Holding Company makes adjustments in eligible collaterals received for possible future fluctuations in the value of the collateral in line with the requirements specified by SBP guidelines. These adjustments, also referred to as to produce volatility adjusted amounts for collateral, are reduced from the exposure to compute the capital charge based on the applicable risk weights.

# 46.1.3.3 Types of collateral taken by the Holding Company

The Holding Company determines the appropriate collateral for each facility based on the type of product and counterparty. In case of corporate and SME financing, fixed assets are generally taken as security for long tenor loans and current assets for working capital finance usually backed by mortgage or hypothecation. For project finance, security of the assets of the borrowers and assignment of the underlying project contracts are generally obtained. Additional security such as pledge of shares, cash collateral, TDRs, SSC/DSCs, charge on receivables may also be obtained. Moreover, in order to cover the entire exposure personal guarantees of directors / borrowers are also obtained generally by the Holding Company. For retail products, the security to be taken is defined in the product policy for the respective products. Housing loans and automobile loans are secured by the security of the property and automobile being financed respectively. The Holding Company also offers products which are primarily based on collateral such as shares, specified securities and pledged commodities. These products are offered in line with the SBP prudential regulations and approved product policies which also deal with types of collateral, valuation and margining.


ANNUAL REPORT 2022 519



CORPORATE REPORTING


The decision on the type and quantum of collateral for each transaction is taken by the credit approving authority as per the credit approval authorization approved by the Central Credit Committee (CCC) under its delegation powers. For facilities provided as per approved product policies (retail products, loan against shares etc.), collateral is taken in line with the policy.

# 46.1.3.4 Types of eligible financial collateral

For credit risk mitigation purposes (capital adequacy purposes), the Holding Company considers all types of financial collaterals that are eligible under SBP Basel III accord. This includes cash / TDRs, gold, securities issued by Government of Pakistan such as T-Bills and PIBs, National Savings Certificates, certain debt securities rated by recognised credit rating agencies, mutual fund units where daily Net Asset Value (NAV) is available in public domain and guarantees from certain specified entities (Government of Pakistan, Banks etc.) under substitution effect of Basel.

# 46.1.3.5 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz. industry, geography, and single/group borrower exposures. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on maximum exposure to single borrower, group borrowers and related parties. Moreover, in order to restrict the industry concentration risk, Holding annual credit plan spells out the maximum allowable exposure that it can take on specific industry. Additionally, the Internal Rating System allows the Holding Company to monitor risk rating concentration of borrowers against different grades / scores ranging from 1 - 12 (1 being the best and 12 being loss category). Concentration in customers that are rated in high risk category is also monitored against the approved appetite set by the management.

# 46.2 Market Risk

Market risk exposes the Holding Company to the risk of financial losses resulting from movements in market prices. It is the risk associated with changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. To manage and control market risk, a comprehensive Board approved Market & Liquidity Risk Management Policy, is in place. The policy outlines a well-defined risk control structure, responsibilities of relevant stakeholders with respect to market risk management and methods to measure and control market risk at a portfolio level. Furthermore, it includes controls which are applied, where necessary, to individual risk types, to particular books and to specific exposures. These controls include limits on exposure to individual market risk variables as well as limits on concentrations of tenors. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.


522    BANK ALFALAH



CORPORATE REPORTING

Under the BoD approved policy, the Holding Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and Investment Committee (IC) are primarily responsible for the oversight of market risk, supported by Market & Liquidity Risk Department of Risk Management Division (RMD). The Holding Company uses the Standardized Approach to calculate capital charge for market risk as per the current regulatory framework under Basel II / III. Furthermore, the Bank carries out risk assessment via diversified tools including Value at Risk (VaR), PV01 (price value per basis point) and Duration on a regular basis. The Holding Company also ascertains the impact of market risk on relevant portfolios through stress testing and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment processes.

# 46.3 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates. FX risk is mainly managed through matched positions. The Holding Company manages FX risk by setting and monitoring dealer and currency-wise limits. Currency risk is regulated and monitored against regulatory limits enforced by the State Bank of Pakistan. FX limits in respective currencies are managed against the prescribed limits. Risk Assessment with respect to FX risk is conducted on a regular basis through VaR analysis.

# 46.3.2 Equity position Risk

Equity position risk arises due to adverse movements in the prices of equities and instruments exhibiting behaviour similar to equities held by the Holding Company. The Holding equity investments are classified as Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) investments. The objective of classifying investments as HFT is to take advantage of short term capital gains, while the AFS portfolio is maintained with a medium term view of capital gains and dividend income. The Holding Investment Committee is primarily responsible for the oversight of the equity investment risk. Market Risk Unit of RMD monitors portfolio and scrip level internal and regulatory limits.

# CORPORATE REPORTING

# 46.5 Operational Risk

Basel II defines Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

The Operational Risk Management Framework, policy and Standards of the Holding Company duly approved by the Central Management Committee and the Board, cover the processes, structure and functions of operational risk management and provides guidelines to identify, assess, monitor, control and report operational risk in a consistent and transparent manner across the Holding Company.

# 46.5.1 Operational Risk Disclosures - Basel II Specific

The Holding Company is among the first few banks in the industry to secure SBP approval for adoption of Alternative Standardized Approach (ASA) under Basel II for determining capital charge on operational risk in December 2013. The Holding Company started calculating its capital charge for operational risk using ASA from December 31, 2013.

The SBP approval stipulated a capital floor i.e. operational risk charge under ASA should not fall below as a certain percentage of operational risk capital charge calculated under Basic Indicator Approach for initial three years. These floors were 90% for 2013 and 2014, 80% for 2015 and 70% for 2016. However, removal of capital floor for calculation of capital charge under ASA was extended in line with international developments and consultations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

Embedding a sustainable risk culture remains our core objective, which includes effective management of operational issues and emerging risks across the Holding Company and in our overseas operations via deployment of required resources, tools and continuous supervision. The new Operational Risk Framework, Policy and Standards, duly approved by the Board, have been rolled out along with new system platforms (Operational Risk System) for recording and tracking of risk events, including non-financial risks. We aim to implement a new process based Risk and Control Self-Assessment method across the Holding Company in order to effectively manage operational risks and continually monitor the effectiveness of defined controls through first line self-assessment reviews, especially for the processes and activities that may significantly impact the Holding risk appetite. Furthermore, new and amended products, systems, activities and processes are subject to comprehensive operational risk assessments before implementation and launch.

# 46.5.2 Information Security Risk

The Holding Company has in place an Information Security Risk Management Policy and an IT Management Policy, duly approved by the Board of Directors, which derive from the regulatory mandates and the ISO 27001:2013 international standards framework. A dedicated Information Security Division, functioning within Credit & Risk Management Group manages information security risks to Holding technology assets by developing Information security baselines for IT solutions that support products and services; security solutions selection, and acquisition including vendor and/or service provider selection managed by Information Security in close coordination with ITG and procurement/central administration; monitoring of threats and vulnerabilities though Security Operations Centre (24/7); investigation of reported information security incidents; reinforcement of Information security risk awareness to employees via periodic communications; following up on due dates with stakeholders responsible for remediation of open issues; and reporting the status of Information security risk to the management and Board IT Committee (BITC)/Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSC)/Board.

# 46.5.3 Environmental Risk Unit

The Holding Company has integrated sustainable finance approach in its lending activities. In this regard, Green Banking Policy and Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) have been put in place.

The ESMS Framework essentially requires that any relevant lending opportunity is to be reviewed and evaluated under:

- International Finance Corporation exclusion list;
- Applicable national laws on environment, health, safety and social issues; and
- International Finance Corporation performance standards.

This framework is an integral part of the credit approval process. All relevant credit proposals require Environmental & Social review prior to approval of the competent authority.

On 9th November, 2022 State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Implementation Manual, based on IFC performance standards, which is applicable to all banks in Pakistan. Bank Alfalah is currently aligning its procedures and policy with the afore-mentioned SBP manual.




# 46.5.4 Country risk

Country risk refers to the possibility that economic and political conditions in a foreign country could adversely impact the Holding exposure in that country. For the Holding Company, country risk arises as a result of the Holding net investment in foreign operations, foreign currency lending, trade and treasury business with counterparties domiciled in other countries as well as investments and capital transactions. In order to manage the risk, the Holding Company has in place a comprehensive country risk management framework. Under this framework, the transfer risk is measured using financial market and economic factors. Political risk is measured using a variety of indicia indicative of willingness to honour its foreign obligations. Based on this framework, risk limits are assigned to countries within the Board approved limits. The limits and their utilization are monitored and managed at head office level and country risk exposures are reported to the relevant committees at a defined frequency.

# 46.6 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity is a financial capacity to meet its obligations as they fall due without incurring losses. Liquidity risk is the risk to an earnings, capital and reputation arising from its inability (real or perceived) to meet its contractual obligations in a timely manner without incurring unacceptable losses when they come due.

With reference to SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD circular # 08 dated June 23, 2016, the Holding Company calculates Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis. Based on December 31, 2022 numbers Holding LCR is 2.11 or 2.11% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Stock of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of Rs. 894,686.108 million and Net Cash Outflows of Rs. 424,966.702 million.

Moreover, under the same circular the Banks are expected to calculate Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) on quarterly basis. Based on December 31, 2022 numbers the Holding NSFR is 1.50 or 150% against SBP minimum requirement of 100%, with Total Available Stable Funding of Rs. 1,275,841.967 million and Total Required Stable Funding of Rs. 849,189.870 million.

The Holding Company manages and controls liquidity risk through a detailed risk management framework, which includes BoD approved policy, management level procedural document and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) level guidelines. Under this framework, various liquidity metrics are implemented and monitored on a regular basis.

The Board approves the Holding overall liquidity risk appetite and broad liquidity risk strategy through Annual Business Plan. The Holding ALCO is primarily responsible for the implementation of Board's strategy through oversight of the asset is the Holding first line of defence against liquidity risk. Under Risk Management Division, Liquidity Risk Management Unit is responsible for independent monitoring of the overall liquidity risk in line with regulatory requirements and the Holding own risk appetite.

The Holding overall funding strategy is based on the principles of diversification and stability. The Holding Company has a diverse funding base, which includes stable funding in the form of equity, sub-ordinated loans, retail and small business deposits and non-stable funding in form of large volume depositors. The Holding Company has in place internally approved limits to monitor and manage risk emanating from volatile funding concentration. Moreover, the Holding Company is fully compliant with Basel III LCR and NSFR, which ensure sufficient stock of high quality liquidity assets in relation to its liability profile.

Stress testing is used in an attempt to highlight the vulnerability of the Holding balance sheet to hypothetical stress events and scenarios. Under the same, liquidity risk factors are given major shocks and their resulting impact on the balance sheet is calculated. The Holding Company carries out the stress testing based on SBP stress tests and internal defined scenarios to gauge the potential impacts of different liquidity stress scenarios on the Holding stock of liquid assets. The results are shared with the senior management, BoD and the regulator.

At the Holding Company, Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), is implemented to address liquidity issues in times of stress / crises situations. The Treasury division prepares the CFPs for all operations on annual basis for identifying the stress scenarios and the funding plan for such scenarios along with early warning indicators. These plans are reviewed by the Risk Management Division and are approved by the ALCO annually.

Main drivers of LCR results are High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and Net Cash Outflow. HQLA is defined by the liquidity quality of the Holding assets and net cash outflow is mainly determined through volatility of the Holding liability profile. The table below showcases the composition of HQLA as of December 31, 2022.

| HQLA\*          | Market Value | Weighted Amount |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Level 1 Assets  | 884,736,343  | 884,736,343     |
| Level 2A Assets | 2,123,715    | 1,805,158       |
| Level 2B Assets | 7,260,282    | 3,700,744       |
|                 | 894,120,340  | 890,242,245     |
