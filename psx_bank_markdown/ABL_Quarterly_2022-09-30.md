# Economic Review

The global economy is going through a number of turbulent challenges. Persistently soaring inflation has increased cost of living which is creating difficulty especially for the lower income segments. Slowdown in China as a result of lockdowns caused by re-emergence of pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict are hampering economic activities, which as a whole are weakening global economic growth outlook. Tightened monetary and fiscal measures have been adopted by the central banks in most of the economies to cope with high inflationary pressures and to moderate consumer demand. Resultantly International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected the global growth to remain subdued at 3.2% in 2022.

In sync with the global trend, domestic economy is confronting with inflationary and external sector pressures coupled with economic and humanitarian crisis due to recent floods. IMF has projected Pakistan’s GDP growth at 3.5% (recent floods not accounted for by IMF) in 2023. While State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has projected GDP growth of 2% in 2023.

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) registered negative growth of 0.4% in July-Aug FY2023 as against growth of 11.3% in July-Aug FY2022 due to monsoon-led floods, elevated inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions.

Major and minor kharif crops’ productivity has been affected adversely by floods caused by heavy monsoon spell. SBP has assigned an annual agriculture credit disbursement target of Rs1.8 trillion for FY-2023 to cater to the agriculture credit demand. Disbursement of agriculture credit during Jul-Aug FY2023 increased by 32% to reach at Rs. 226 billion as compared to Rs. 172 billion during corresponding period last year.

On the external front, fiscal measures adopted to discourage imports along with boosting exports have started yielding positive results. Exports grew by 10.8% to reach at US$ 6,223 million during Jul-Aug FY2023 as compared to US$ 5,618 million in corresponding period last year. With a decline of 1.7% imports stood at US$ 12,837 million during Jul-Aug FY2023 as against US$ 13,057 million in Jul-Aug FY2022.

Strict policy actions and adoption of stabilization strategies to combat trade imbalances have produced positive results. Current account deficit dropped to US$ 703 million for the month of August FY2023 as against deficit of US$ 1,523 million in the same month last year, whereas accumulative deficit for Jul-Aug FY2023 reduced to US$ 1,918 million as compared to US$ 2,374 million in the corresponding period last year.

Worker’s remittances recorded at US$ 7.7 billion during the period of Jul-Sep FY2023 showing a negative growth of 6.3% over the same period last year.



Allied Bank Limited

Pakistan Net Foreign Reserves and Net Foreign Reserves with SBP were recorded at US$ 13,589 million and US$ 7,900 million respectively as on 30 September 2022.

During Jul-Sep FY2023, Net Foreign Direct Investment was recorded at US$ 253.4 million as compared to US$ 479.2 million in last year showing decrease of 47%. Whereas, Net Portfolio Investment recorded an outflow of US$ 30 million during Jul-Sep FY2023 as compared to an inflow of US$ 879 million during the comparable period last year.

Money Supply (M2) registered a Year on Year (YoY) growth of 15% and reached at Rs. 28,018 billion as on September 30, 2022. Whereas, currency in circulation stood at Rs. 7,653 billion showing a YoY growth of 9%.

On the fiscal side, Federal Board of Revenue was able to surpass the target by Rs. 22.5 billion during Jul-Aug FY2023 and provisional net revenue collection grew by 9.7% to reach at Rs. 948.1 billion against Rs. 864.5 billion in the comparable period last year.

Headline inflation observed decline of 4.1% in the month of September 2022 to reach at 23.2% against 27.3% in the previous month.

In view of prevailing uncertainty, investors’ sentiments remained bearish, KSE-100 index closed at 41,128 points as on September 30, 2022 against 44,596 points as on December 31, 2021. Pakistan Rupee depreciated by 12% against US Dollar from June 30, 2022 to stand at Rs. 228.452 as on September 30, 2022.

In view of this challenging situation, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) adopted tightening of monetary policy to moderate demand, prevent the compounding of inflationary pressures and to safeguard the external stability and has progressively inflated policy rate by 525 basis points since December 2021 to bring it at 15.00% on July 07, 2022. Despite of prevailing negative real interest rates gap, deceleration in economic activities, reduction in headline CPI and the waning current account deficit gave breathing space to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to maintain policy rate at 15%.

# Financial Review

Banking Sector’s performance remained encouraging despite of operating in challenging economic environment due to global slow down, inflationary pressure, high tax regime for banks in Pakistan and tightening monetary policy.

Industry’s assets increased by 15% as on September 30, 2022 to stand at Rs. 33,155 billion. Asset base growth is primarily due to Investments and net advances which stand at Rs. 17,484 billion and Rs. 10,395 billion showing growth of 24% and 10% respectively.

Total deposits of industry increased by 9% to stand at Rs. 22,820 billion as on September 30, 2022 as against Rs. 20,972 billion as on December 31, 2021.

Positive volumetric growth in average earning assets coupled with positive rate variance resulted in 74% of growth in mark-up income of Your Bank to reach at Rs. 147,552 million as against Rs. 84,696 million same period last year. The positive rate variance is due to higher yield on Investments, Advances and Bank Placements.

Likewise, Mark-up expense increased by Rs. 52,096 million showing a growth of 104% to reach at Rs. 102,110 million as on September 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 50,014 million in the comparative period last year. This increase is on account of higher cost of deposits, borrowing expense and interest expense on Right of Use of Asset. Net Interest Income increased by 31% to reach at Rs. 45,442 million during the captioned period as compared to Rs. 34,682 million last year.

On Non-Markup income side, growth of 39% has been observed bringing the non-interest income to reach at Rs. 16,328 million for the nine months ended on September 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 11,729 million for the same period last year.

Fee income has reached at Rs. 5,938 million registering a growth of 20%, which was Rs. 4,950 million in the comparable period last year. This increase is on account of higher card related fee, branch banking customer fee, and investment banking fee.

Foreign exchange income reached to Rs. 7,142 million for the period under review as compared to Rs. 1,112 million for same period last year mainly attributable to higher trade volumes, volatility in spot and swaps.

Dividend Income increased by Rs. 172 million showing a growth of 9% to reach at Rs. 1,983 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as against Rs. 1,811 million for same period last year.

Despite hiked inflation, impact of currency devaluation and continued investment towards technological upgradation, operating expenses growth was restricted to 18% during the period under review.

Despite the challenging economic conditions and banking dynamics, Your Bank registered appreciable growth of 50% in Profit before tax which stood at Rs. 33,024 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as against Rs. 21,973 million for comparative period last year.

Vide Finance Act, 2022, Corporate Tax Rate for Banking companies enhanced from 35% to 39%, Super Tax on high earning persons is levied for Tax Year 2023 (Income Year 2022) at 10% and subsequently at 4% and Tax Rate on attributable Income from Investments in Federal Government Securities increased (49% for ADR 40%-50%) retrospectively from Tax Year 2022 (Income Year 2021). This resulted in 62% average tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to average tax rate of 41% for the corresponding period last year.

Profit after Tax was recorded at Rs. 12,628 million in the captioned period, lower by 3% from Rs. 13,070 million in the corresponding period last year. In line with profit after tax earnings per share (EPS) of Your Bank also reduced to Rs. 11.03 per share for the nine months period ended September 30, 2022, against Rs. 11.41 per share in the corresponding period last year.



3rd Quarterly Report – September 2022

# Directors’ Review

To provide seamless services and on the go banking facilities, Your Bank is focusing on enhancing digital footprints by adopting advanced and innovative digitization processes along with brick-and-mortar expansion.

Allied Bank’s outreach stood at 1,432 branches including 1,306 conventional, 117 Islamic and 7 Digital branches as on September 30, 2022. ATM network reached at 1,569 machines consisting of 1,294 on-site, 270 off-site and 5 Mobile Banking Units (MBU). Average ATM uptime was registered at 96.41% for the nine-month ended September 30, 2022.

Total asset base of Your Bank increased by 3% to reach at Rs. 2,061 billion as on September 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 2,010 billion in December 2021. Investments and Net Advances closed at Rs. 1,088,683 million and Rs. 673,687 million showing growth of 2% and 3% respectively.

Persistent focus on prudent risk management practices led to 4% decline in Non-Performing advances which stood at Rs. 13,015 million as on September 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 13,601 million as on December 31, 2021. Your bank continued its momentum towards lower infection ratio which stood at 1.90% as on September 30, 2022 as compared to industry average infection ratio of 7.5% as on June 30, 2022. No forced sale value (FSV) benefit was availed while determining the provision against Non-Performing Loans, allowed under SBP guidelines.

Your Bank’s borrowings stood at Rs. 309,351 million as on September 30, 2022 decreased by 26% as compared to Rs. 420,006 million as on December 31, 2021.

Total Deposits of your bank registered a growth of 10% to stand at Rs. 1,551,230 million in the captioned period as against Rs. 1,413,295 million as on December 31, 2021. Your bank pivoted its concentration towards low-cost deposits which is evident from a growth of 9% in non-remunerative current deposits. Whereas, current account to total deposit ratio and current account saving account (CASA) deposit mix stood at 42% and 80% respectively, as on September 2022.

Return on Assets and Return on Equity were recorded at 0.83% and 15.08% respectively as on September 30, 2022. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) remained resilient at 20.40% against a statutory requirement of 11.5%.

# Future Outlook:

Uncertainties and downside risks to the world economic outlook remain elevated. The economic challenges emanating from geopolitical conflicts, deeper-than-expected deceleration in China, mounting inflationary pressures and aggressive monetary measures will continue to undermine the global economic growth prospects. Keeping in the view the current economic situation, the IMF has recently projected global growth at 2.7% and 3.2% in FY2023 and FY2027 respectively.

On the domestic front, SBP anticipates the GDP growth to fall around 2% in FY2023 as compared to previous forecast of 3-4% due to recent floods. Inflation is expected to surpass the pre-flood projection of 18-20% in FY2023 and to fall sharply between 5-7% in FY2024. However, headline inflation will continue to be dominated by flood-led supply shocks, Pak-rupee devaluation and hike in international commodity prices in the near future.

Allied Bank being an empathetic corporate entity, has always been at the forefront in supporting the National Cause. Your Bank under the ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ has contributed effectively in flood relief activities in collaboration with credible NGOs across Pakistan. The employees of Your Bank also participated in noble cause of helping the flood affected masses by donating one (1) day salary to provide food supplies, medicines, tents, and other items of daily use.

Your Bank has always taken pride in introducing highly competitive services to facilitate the needs of its diversified customer base. Hence Your Bank is pleased to introduce a new deposit product/account namely ‘Allied Aitebar Salary Management Account’. This product is developed to provide efficient and quick management of payroll services to corporates, institutions, entities and retail clients by offering a Shariah compliant solution.

# Entity Ratings

Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA) maintained the Bank’s long-term and short-term credit rating at the highest level of “AAA” (Triple A) and “A1+” (A One Plus) respectively. These ratings indicate highest credit quality and an exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. Your Bank has consolidated its position as one of the select group of financial institutions in the Country to maintain highest entity credit ratings.

# Corporate Governance Rating

# 23.3.2 Income tax assessments

The income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalized up to and including tax year 2021 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2021, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 32,741 million (2021: 32,741 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Bank and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Bank on aggregate sum of Rs. 32,741 million (2021: 32,741 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Bank.

Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 1,700 million (2021: 1,700 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Bank; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,700 million (2021: 1,700 million).

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005 / Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million).

# 23.3.3 Foreign exchange repatriation cases

While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court (FEAC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has arbitrarily adjudicated penalties against various banks including Rs. 2,173 million in aggregate against Allied Bank Limited (the Bank). Against the said judgments, the Bank had filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions (CP) in the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. The Honorable High Court granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Meanwhile, along with other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the FE Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated 15.01.2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 35 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 23.3.2 Income tax assessments

The income tax assessments of the Group have been finalized up to and including tax year 2021 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2021, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Group before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Group and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Group on aggregate sum of Rs. 32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Group.

Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million). The Group’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Group; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million).

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005 / Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million). The Group’s appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million).

Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated 15.01.2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 35 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as “held to maturity”. Quoted
securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments
in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest
available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings
cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities
and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has
been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 5.4 to these unconsolidated financial
statements.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in
making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value
hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
