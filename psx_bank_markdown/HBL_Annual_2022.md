CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY

Corporate Sustainability for HBL involves integrating sustainable practices and principles into our operations, strategies, and decision-making processes. We recognise the unique role we can play as a bank in promoting sustainability, due to our ability to direct capital and investment towards more sustainable and socially responsible initiatives.

To fulfil its Corporate Social Responsibility, HBL has devised a pathway to set sustainability targets that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide a powerful aspiration and a blueprint for peace and prosperity, for people and our planet and further a call to action in cultivating partnerships and striving towards a sustainable world. These targets include reducing carbon emissions, increasing investments in sustainable projects, promoting sustainable finance and investment practices, increasing access of financial services for the masses, dedicating 1.5% of our Profit after taxes to Healthcare, Education and Community Development interventions across the Country.

From 2021, HBL has initiated a separate publication of its Impact & Sustainability Report annually and has made the same available on its website, on the following link: https://www.hbl.com/sustainability.

Whilst a detailed review of HBL’s activities to contribute towards the SDGs will form part of our forthcoming Impact & Sustainability report, a synopsis is provided herein below.

# Gender Equality

- HBL is declared as Pakistan’s Most Inclusive Company of the Year 2022, winning 15 awards based on the Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Benchmark (GDEIB) Assessment 2022. HBL established a mandate to drive the DEI agenda and include it within its processes with respect to: hiring, career development for females, retention, female friendly policies and platforms and has its ‘Leadership Team’ have a strong mandate to implement the gender diversity mandate in their KPIs. HR policies have also been revised to support this agenda and position HBL as the ‘Employer of Choice’ for females all over Pakistan at every level with females being 22% of the labour force.
- Gender-based violence and harassment is condemned at HBL, for which Code of Ethics and Business Conduct Awareness Sessions are held across various functions of the Bank including domestic and international locations to instill values of respect at workplace. In case of an incidence, the guidance for law and recourse available was provided in a session in alliance with Federal Ombudsperson Secretariat for Protection Against Harassment (FOSPAH), titled “Women at Workplace”.
- Gender diversification in digital and innovative opportunities is practiced under the HBL Konnect ambit with an 81% increase of women Konnect Agents in 2022, the highest increase being in Northern Pakistan. Female agents are introduced at KE bill collection centres and Konnect retail shops.

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022



# Disability Inclusion Agenda

HBL has a strong Disability Inclusion Agenda driven by the inclusion framework. It includes an annual internship programme, partnership with multiple disability expert organisations, assistive device grant facility and sign language interpreter facility for the support of PWDs.

# Clean Water and Sanitation

The recent floods of 2022 severely exacerbated the problem of access to safe drinking water in Sindh and Balochistan. HBL approved a grant of PKR 10 million through HBL Foundation for procurement and distribution of 2,500 water filtration kits for flood affected families. These kits are able to treat and purify stagnant, filthy water and provide 10,000 glasses of water every day with a flow rate of 60 litres per hour.

# Affordable and Clean Energy

HBL’s Green Taxonomy is a tool to facilitate directing flows of capital to green projects that would make a substantial contribution to environmental sustainability. A taxonomy-based Green Loan Management Framework was established to track HBL’s performance in supporting green transition in national and regional economy and to identify Green Lending Activities.

HBL participated in funding of over 70 projects to facilitate affordable and clean energy. Two wind and one solar power project sustained commercial operations with HBL’s support during 2022. These projects successfully provided 200 MW of clean and sustainable energy at the national grid. During 2022, HBL secured a mandate for the establishment of solar power project under a Bulk Power Consumer (BPC) Model and a mandate to enhance Hydropower Potential and Capacity, for the KPK Province. Meanwhile, leveraging on State Bank of Pakistan’s Renewable Energy Scheme, HBL nearly utilised the allotted limit of PKR 7.9 billion, allowing its clients in the said domain, space to capitalise on subsidised financing, progressing to cheaper renewable power generation for the economy.

HBL has a Green Climate Fund (GCF) accreditation which works to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in developing countries, and to help vulnerable societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.

# Decent Work and Economic Growth

HBL improved lending policies with 20% increase in lending, introduction of cash flow based lending, 50% increase in supply-chain financing and collaboration with fintech to offer digital lending to SMEs has proclaimed HBL as a market leader in the SME sector.

HBL provides digitized disbursement solutions through Konnect which is availed by Sindh Education Literacy Program (SELP) to disburse stipends, World Health Organization (WHO)




# Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

HBL takes pride in serving 33 million customers and has now partnered with key E-Commerce and retail businesses to introduce mPOS, a Tap n Pay solution and digital invoicing, which has empowered SMEs to employ E-Commerce to conduct their businesses on large-scale in low-cost, which will further expand the Bank’s customer-base.

HBL has employed enterprise solutions and digital payments by enabling PayPak and a Unified Payment Interface (UPI) which has allowed HBL to acquire merchants of larger portfolios and further extends our goal of financial inclusion. HBL also provides Biller Aggregator Services to financial institutions associated with the Bank through it, which helps measure volume and value of categorical transactions plus aggregate data of financial institutions and billers associated with the Bank.

# Climate Action

HBL has aimed to reduce its carbon footprint till 2030 under its Net Zero Plan. A “No New Coal” Policy and “No Deforestation” Policy has been ongoing that represents a very significant commitment by the Bank towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, aimed towards, (1) bringing down HBL‘s exclusion list exposure (which includes industries such as tobacco) to zero by 2025 (2) bringing down HBL’s coal-related exposure to zero by 2030.

Green Building Principles are adopted for the construction of major buildings of HBL. HBL is also collaborating with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for designating selective branches as Green Offices.

An annual nationwide Tree Plantation Drive has been launched by HBL, aimed towards planting 20,000 saplings of indigenous plants across Pakistan. A Mangroves plantation event in 2022 planted 10,000 mangrove saplings at Miani Horr on the coast of Balochistan and 25,700 trees across nine other locations in Pakistan.

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

# CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

2022 was a year of extraordinary growth for HBL, with record operating results and an entrenched leadership position in the Country’s banking space. Despite the challenging environment, HBL delivered its highest profit before tax at Rs. 77 billion, and its balance sheet grew by 7% to Rs. 4.6 trillion. HBL and its subsidiary, HBL Microfinance Bank, were recognised as the ‘Best Bank’ and the ‘Best Microfinance Bank’ in Pakistan by the Institute of Bankers Pakistan. Our relentless efforts and unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion has also been recognised, with HBL named as the ‘Most Inclusive Organization’ at the 2022 GDEIB Awards. HBL’s gender ratio is now over 22%, a long way from 2004 when that number was 3%.

The Bank's digital solutions have become a way of life, serving more than 33 million customers, with digital throughput crossing Rs. 13.4 trillion. As Pakistan’s premier financial institution, HBL remains committed to providing thought leadership in different spheres of the Country’s development. Our pioneering interventions in agriculture have had a dramatic impact on Pakistani farmers, and we will scale this up rapidly.

As we navigate through challenging times, we remain live to risks and intend to pursue a course that ensures the highest possible standards across the entire product offerings of the Bank.

# Banking at your Fingertips

Banking has never been more accessible, thanks to HBL's investment in smart digitalization. The Bank's Mobile and Internet Banking platform saw its user base exceed 3 million in 2022.

Financial inclusion remains a steadfast priority for us. Konnect by HBL is the Bank’s main vehicle for offering easy access to the unbanked and under-banked segments of society across Pakistan. Konnect now has 8.3 million clients. Women constitute 24% of the client base.

HBL further serves people across Pakistan through its 165,000 plus touchpoints, including branches, agents, ATMs, QR codes and POS machines, making it the largest financial distribution network in the Country. Through HBL agents, clients are now able to conduct banking services without a phone. All of this has eased payments and financial transactions for a broad base of clients.

Smart and user-friendly technologies will drive future growth as HBL connects with Pakistan's under-served communities and burgeoning youth population. This year, HBL also became the first bank in Pakistan to offer a full range of banking services through WhatsApp.

From HBL Mobile to Konnect, QR payments to e-commerce, HBL has set the standard for client convenience with faster processing. As digitalization deepens, HBL protects client data with a dedicated, constantly updating Information Security Function, and a 24x7 Security Operations Centre.


HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022


Bank with a Soul
HBL is more than just a bank. We operate with a soul and remain committed to enhancing the well-being of society and contributing to the communities in which we operate.

The HBL Foundation increased its philanthropic funding to 1.5% of the Bank's profit after tax and provided much-needed relief this year to flood-affected families through partnerships with Jubilee Insurance and the Government of Pakistan.

This year, we are proud to inform our shareholders that HBL raised its staff service age to 65. This policy has long-term implications on household incomes, which have come under increasing pressure due to high inflation and strong head winds. HBL has offered its employees a cost-of-living adjustment and enhanced its staff training programmes to build capacity. In this context, over 500,000 person-hours of training were delivered during the year. We also undertook other key initiatives for the HBL community; notably, financial support for childcare for working mothers, the Waapsi returnship programme for experienced women re-entering the workforce, and the creation of positions for persons with disabilities.

# Securing our Future

HBL plays a leading role in developing the agriculture sector and promoting sustainable food supply chains. We are investing in cutting-edge methods, practices, and technologies to support Pakistani farmers and address the related challenges of agriculture, food security, and climate change.

Agricultural financing continues to remain a key priority area for the Bank, and I am pleased to report that HBL recorded an all-time high asset deployment of Rs. 50.6 billion. HBL's supply-side initiatives and impartial agronomical advisory have helped farmers improve production, achieving an average increase of 46% in crop yield and an impressive average increase of 195% in net income. The ‘Haryali Account’ and ‘Kissan Ki Awaz’ programmes will further upscale financial literacy and awareness among farming communities, including women farmers.

HBL's commitment to sustainability remains firm, and over the course of the year solar panels were installed in 232 premises, leading to a 288 MT reduction in carbon footprint.

Our initiatives were recognised with the ‘Top Agri Lending Bank’ Award and an Environmental Excellence Award.

# Regional Hub for Trade

HBL‘s presence in China and our successful China coverage model has expanded to UAE, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives, and East Africa through our affiliate DTB, serving Chinese State Owned Enterprises and large private sector corporates.

HBL's international operations improved in 2022, with trade volumes up 68%, and network client business doubled. We are one of only 3 banks in MENA and South Asia to offer end-to-end RMB intermediation, extending liquidity management and salary remittance services to Chinese clients and expatriate employees.

We intend to continue leveraging our unique position and become the flagship bank for international business over the next few years.

# Building Value

HBL's clients and staff have played a pivotal role in the Bank's continued success. Thanks to their dedication, HBL remains the ‘Best Bank in Pakistan’, with the highest Brand Equity Index (BEI) of 4.1. We appreciate our shareholders' trust and support and pledge to maintain our commitment to excellence and cutting-edge digital solutions. We also extend our gratitude to our regulators for their guidance.

At the AGM, we plan to distribute a final cash dividend of Rs. 1.50 per share, bringing the total for the year to Rs. 6.75 per share, after previously declaring and paying interim dividends of Rs. 5.25 per share.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

# DIRECTORS’ REPORT

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

# Macroeconomic Review

Following a high-growth phase in FY’22 when the economy expanded by 6.0%, FY’23 commenced with Pakistan’s worst-ever floods, causing an estimated damage of ~$32 billion. Pakistan’s challenges have been significant – the external front was impacted by rising commodity prices and debt repayments, exacerbated by delays in the IMF program, while the domestic economy came under severe pressure, compounded by a lack of political clarity. These factors have led to an overall slowdown in the economy with moderation in most high-frequency data. The Large-Scale Manufacturing Index posted a decline of 3.7% during 1HFY’23 and the SBP has warned of downside risks to even the 2% target for GDP growth.

In Jan’23, inflation surged on account of higher fuel and energy prices, food inflation and currency depreciation, registering a nearly 50-year high of 27.6%. Core inflation, which has been on a consistently rising trend, increased to 17.0%, reflecting the secondary impact of rising energy prices. Average inflation for 7MFY’23 is 25.4% vs 10.2% in the same period last year and is already much higher than the SBP’s FY’23 projection of 21% - 23%.

The global economic slowdown took its toll on Pakistan’s external sector. Exports fell by 7% in 7MFY’23, compared to the same period last year. The trade balance however, improved, as restrictions on luxury imports, fiscal and monetary tightening, and an overall slowdown in demand led to a 21% contraction in imports. The trade deficit for 7MFY’23 thus declined by 31% to $17 billion. With the gap between the interbank and the kerb rates widening, remittances decreased to $1.9 billion in Jan’23, the fifth successive month-on-month decline and the first sub-$2 billion level since May’20. For 7MFY’23, remittances of $16 billion were 11% lower YoY. However, the narrowing of the trade deficit supported the current account, with the 7MFY’23 deficit falling by 67% over 7MFY’22, to $3.8 billion.

Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves depleted to nine-year lows, falling to $2.9 billion by 3 Feb’23, amid delays in the IMF review. Most external financing avenues are now linked to the IMF Board approval. The completion of a number of prior actions, including additional taxation measures and further increases in fuel, gas and utilities prices should help move closer to the Staff Level Agreement. The deteriorating external account dragged the currency, which remained volatile throughout the year and ended the year 27% (Rs 48/$) lower. The recent restoration of a market-determined exchange rate caused a further downward spike with the Rupee falling by Rs 49/$ to Rs 275/$ before recovering slightly.

The primary surplus in 1HFY’23 improved significantly, both in absolute and percentage terms; this clocked in at 1.1% of GDP compared to 0.1% of GDP in 1HFY’22. Tax collections increased by 17% YoY in 1HFY’23, driven by a 50% increase in direct taxes. However, current expenditure increased by 30%, led by floods and a 77% increase in mark-up payments. The fiscal deficit for 1HFY’23 thus registered a 23% increase over 1HFY’22 to PKR 1.7 trillion, although it remained at 2.0% of GDP.

Equity markets saw another volatile year with the market shedding 2% during the last quarter and 9% from December 2021. Investor participation remained dull with low volumes as macroeconomic pressure, extended political uncertainty and a rapidly falling Rupee all weighed on sentiments. The exodus of foreigners continued, particularly in banking sector stocks as international investors sold $127 million over the year.

The central bank has continued to tighten monetary policy and, in the Jan’23 MPC, raised the policy rate by 100 basis points to 17%, a 25-year high. The SBP was of the view that inflation is broad-based and persistent, with core inflation on a rising trend for the past 10 months. Further, expectations have skewed upwards, and timely intervention was needed to lower them. It emphasised that the short-term costs of taming inflation are lower than the costs of allowing it to become entrenched. Industry advances and deposits were distorted in Dec’22 as banks raced to increase their Asset / Deposit Ratio to avoid punitive tax rates. For 2022, industry advances increased by 17% while deposits growth slowed to only 7%, with market deposits showing their first-ever fourth-quarter decline in Q4’22. Industry spreads in 2022 grew by 100 bps over 2021, reflecting the increase in benchmark interest rates and the continuing re-pricing of balance sheets.

# Financial Performance

In 2022, HBL has delivered its highest profit before tax of Rs 77.0 billion with a consistent growth trajectory throughout the year, backed by record quarterly profits. PBT is 24% higher than the PBT of Rs 62.0 billion last year. The Bank’s profit after tax, however, declined by 3% to Rs 34.4 billion, as a higher tax charge caused by excessive and retrospective taxation impacted the bottom line by Rs 11.3 billion. Earnings per share declined slightly, to Rs 23.23 in 2022 from Rs 23.88 in 2021. HBL’s balance sheet grew by 7% to Rs 4.6 trillion. Domestic current deposits grew by Rs 203 billion, a 20% growth over the prior year, reaching Rs 1.2 trillion; low-cost savings accounts increased by Rs 136 billion. The Bank’s focused efforts to mobilize low-cost deposits and contain its cost of funds led to a record current account mix of 41.5% and a CASA ratio of 86.5%. Total domestic deposits reached Rs 2.9 trillion and HBL’s total deposits as of December 2022 rose to Rs 3.5 trillion.


HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022



# HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

In line with its stated intent of supporting customers throughout economic cycles, HBL helped its clients and the country navigate through extremely challenging times. Domestic advances grew steadily throughout the year, by Rs 241 billion to Rs 1.4 trillion, registering a broad-based growth of over 20% for the second consecutive year. The Bank’s flagship consumer portfolio increased to Rs 122 billion, and lending to the Commercial segment crossed a landmark Rs 100 billion. Agriculture financing is a key priority of the Bank and the portfolio reached an all-time high of Rs 50.6 billion. HBL Microfinance increased its portfolio by 50% to Rs 85 billion, furthering the Bank’s financial inclusion objectives. HBL’s total advances increased by 18.3% to Rs 1.8 trillion, with the ADR improving to 52.9%.

With rapid monetary tightening, net interest margins improved by 81bps over 2021 while the Bank achieved a Rs 540 billion growth in average balance sheet volumes. Consequently, net interest income grew by 26% to Rs 166 billion. Non-fund income grew by 29% to Rs 46.7 billion with a standout performance from all areas. HBL’s dominant fee franchise again delivered excellent results, rising 24% to Rs 31.5 billion. Its flagship Cards business continues to set new records, contributing nearly half the increase in fees and constituting nearly 50% of total fee income. Despite constraints, Trade income grew by 19% to Rs 3.2 billion. Investments in the Bank’s branchless banking initiative, Konnect, are now coming to fruition as Konnect generated fees of Rs 1.5 billion, more than double that in 2021.

HBL continues to invest in its people and its digital infrastructure to deliver innovative and unique customer solutions. HBL, as always, also stepped up to support the country and its people during the catastrophic floods that displaced millions of people. In 2022, total administrative expense increased to Rs 124.8 billion as unprecedented inflation affected costs across all categories. However, with a strong revenue base, the domestic cost / income ratio was maintained at the prior year’s level of 51.1%. Total provisions of the Bank increased marginally, to Rs 8.5 billion, as HBL prudently boosted previously created reserves, in order to insulate the Bank from the fallout of the current economic conditions. HBL’s infection ratio decreased from 5.1% to a new record low of 4.8% while total coverage remained above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

With the strong results, internally generated capital grew by 10% in 2022. The massive Rupee devaluation of Rs 48/$ impacted the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) by 107 bps. As a result, HBL’s consolidated Tier 1 CAR declined to 11.8% while the total CAR reduced to 14.8%. Nevertheless, both ratios remain comfortably above current regulatory requirements; these were eased in December, as the SBP lowered the D-SIB buffer for all categories of banks by 50bps.

In December 2022, the Bank issued Rs 6.5 billion of perpetual term finance certificates, which qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital, thus boosting its Tier 1 CAR by 34 bps.

# HBL Annual Report 2022

HBL is fully committed to investing and growing the SME business in a significant and sustainable way. In 2022, Advances grew by 20% to over Rs 89 billion; new and enhanced limits of Rs 35 billion were approved, 26% higher than in 2021. The SME customer base crossed 15,000, an impressive growth of 25%. The growth in scale and size has been primarily driven through enhancing sales capabilities, process simplification, use of technology and implementing scoring models for quick decisioning. The repositioning of the business has enabled faster growth with particular focus on small businesses that have a real impact on the economy. HBL has entrenched its leading position in the industry with market share increasing from 14.1% to 16.5% in 2022.

New products, focused on cashflow based lending, were designed specifically for Small businesses within the overall SME segment to accommodate the fact that these businesses are frequently collateral deficient and lack formal documentation. This model is delivering results as HBL has already disbursed more than Rs 7 billion to 2,400 customers. The Supply Chain Financing business has shown exponential growth of over 50% and is nearing PKR 10 billion. The Bank is an active participant in SBP-led initiatives for SMEs and has disbursed more than Rs 5 billion under various schemes.

HBL continued to lead the market in Agriculture financing with the landmark achievement of crossing Rs 50 billion in advances, a 27% growth over 2021. The Bank’s already dominant market share crossed 35%. SBP declared HBL as the ‘Top Agri Lending Bank’ in the Large Banks category for FY’22. The Bank was also nominated as the Champion Bank for Balochistan to lead the industry for enhancing access to agriculture credit and financial inclusion in the most under-privileged province of Pakistan. Under this initiative, HBL drove activities to create farmer awareness and worked with educational institutions to prepare students for employment opportunities. HBL was also awarded the Best Bank for Agriculture 2022 at the Pakistan Banking Awards.

In 2022, HBL made fresh disbursements of Rs 17 billion, 30% higher than in 2021, adding 3,500 customers. HBL’s focused approach on the agriculture value chain led to Rs 3 billion financing for businesses with linkages to agriculture such as processing units and cold storage facilities. The revamping of lending to the dairy and livestock sector has enabled the Bank to on-board over 1,400 farms and build a portfolio of more than Rs 3 billion. HBL also maintained leadership in Electronic Warehouse Receipt (EWR) financing by funding over Rs 700 million and achieving a market share of more than 70%. SBP named HBL as the role model financial institution for introducing and upscaling the EWR regime in the country.

HBL stood by its customers during the devastating floods, deferring repayments of more than 5,000 affected farmers while continuing fresh disbursements to enable farmers to timely sow their Rabi crops.

Considering the importance of women in the agriculture workforce, HBL launched the Nanni Kissan and Agli Nasal digital video commercials highlighting the importance of female education in the uplift of agriculture. The financial literacy and awareness of farming communities was further upscaled under the flagship “Kissan Ki Awaz” program with more than 40 sessions conducted across the country.

To bring resilience to the Agriculture sector against climatic vulnerabilities HBL, in collaboration with insurance partners, successfully completed the pilot test of the Area Yield Index Insurance product for wheat-paddy farmers. This provides insurance to farmers in case yields are impacted by climate events. To further its digitalization objectives, HBL implemented an automated Loan Origination System to digitally route loan applications. A Salesforce management application was provided to field teams, facilitating them in digitally recording customer visits and developing a sales pipeline. HBL remained the largest user of the Punjab Land Record Authority’s portal, both in Fard extractions and in online charge creation.

HBL’s unique and first-of-its-kind Farm-to-Processor initiative was implemented in the form of various pilot projects to uplift and turnaround Pakistan’s agriculture sector. HBL has been more than a lender, helping farmers improve their production through supply-side initiatives and impartial agronomical advisory. From only 5 farmers and 444 acres when HBL embarked upon this journey in 2020, the Bank has now achieved completion of 17 pilot projects, scaling up in-kind financing to 550 farmers for 26,000 acres. HBL’s fundamental shift is led by a team of 80 agronomists and field officers who guide farmers on best practices. In order to reduce time away from farm activities, HBL launched a digitally-enabled farmer onboarding system through HBL Pay. As a result of HBL’s interventions, farmers with relatively small land and lease-holdings – who represent the majority of country’s farmers – achieved an average increase of 46% in crop yield (with the highest increase being 118%) and an impressive average increase of 195% in net income (highest increase of 611%). These results have been independently validated by Princeton University development economists and demonstrate a double bottom-line impact both for the farmers and the Bank.

HBL’s Islamic Banking business is one of the fastest growing areas within the Bank, offering the entire spectrum of the Bank’s products, from large-ticket Corporate deals to retail deposits and consumer finance. In 2022, the Islamic branch network increased from 259 to 294. HBL achieved a 7% share of the market for Islamic deposits, with the total customer base crossing 1 million.

The AsiaMoney 2022 survey ranked HBL as the Market Leader amongst domestic banks for cash management as well as the Best Services for cash management in Pakistan.

HBL Mobile and Internet Banking processed more than 125 million financial transactions worth over Rs 2.3 trillion, a doubling over 2021. This growth was driven by higher ticket sizes and a user base that has now grown to 3.2 million. HBL Mobile also processed over half a billion services transactions.

Maintaining its streak of bringing innovative solutions to Pakistan, HBL commercialized the conversion of mobile phones into POS terminals, thus enabling smartphones to accept card-based payments at the time of delivery and revolutionizing the delivery payments process.

HBL continued to leverage its unique position of being one of only 3 banks in MENA and South Asia to offer end-to-end RMB intermediation by extending RMB offerings to other financial institutions. HBL’s RMB Nostro proposition enables it to offer liquidity management to its Chinese clients and salary remittance services to their expatriate employees. HBL China has also established 17 new FI relationships in multiple countries to further enhance the proposition and launched an LC advising rebate program for banks in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Over 300 end-to-end customer journeys were simplified to improve productivity, turnaround time and customer experience.

# HBL Digital Marketing Efforts

HBL digital marketing efforts focused on themes and platforms favoured by its clients. The Pakistan website showed an increase both in traffic as well as in session durations.

HBL’s Agricultural campaign was a heart-warming made-for-digital narrative that received appreciation across social platforms. In 2022, HBL went on TikTok for the first time and continues to grow a presence for reaching younger and more varied audiences.

# Human Resources

True to being a “Bank with a Soul”, HBL undertook a number of initiatives in 2022 to provide support to staff and their families. As a market and industry first, the Bank announced the extension of its service age to 65 years. This was driven by a motivation to support employees when they reach the age of 60, but still have the energy and drive to continue at a high level of performance for some years. This also allows such employees to continue serving our customers and to mentor younger staff. This leading initiative, which was universally hailed, will benefit hundreds of families. To help employees cope with the current economic challenges, two Interim ad hoc financial assistance payments were made to middle and junior management staff. To assist employees with transport costs, interest free motorcycle loans were offered to support employees’ purchase of their own vehicles and ‘Share Sawari”, an in-house ride sharing app was launched. Rehabilitation and reconstruction financial assistance was also provided to staff impacted by the floods.

The Bank’s relentless focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion bore fruit with the Bank being recognized as the Most Inclusive Organization in Pakistan by GDEIB of the Centre for Global Inclusion. As part of this assessment, HBL won 15 awards in various categories. During the year, the Waapsi returnship program for experienced women re-entering the workforce was strengthened with a number of women hired under this program. The Bank ended the year with a diversity ratio of 21%; our goal is to increase participation by women to a quarter of the workforce by 2025. As part of our push to be even more inclusive for people with disabilities, several initiatives were undertaken, including specialized training, targeted hiring, providing grants for assistive devices and launching a specialized internship / work experience program.

Attracting and developing talent remains a cornerstone of the Bank’s strategy. To build a values-based culture and develop leadership capabilities at all levels, the Leadership Excellence program was launched in partnership with a leading global leadership development organization. Under this comprehensive program, spread over the next 3 years, over 3,000 leaders ranging from the Bank’s Executive Committee to the junior-most front-line leader will be trained and developed in line with HBL’s Leadership DNA. In 2022, this program was initiated for the Executive Committee and the General Managers of the Bank; for the remaining employees, it will be launched in 2023.

To create a strong talent pipeline, while also helping to upgrade the capabilities of the country’s educational institutions, collaborations were formalized with 15 universities throughout Pakistan to provide customized support to students, faculty and curriculum depending on institutional needs and HBL’s objectives. This program will assist students with scholarships and internships; provide faculty with research opportunities and real-life business projects; and provide universities with assistance on curriculum development to prepare students with skills required in today’s workplaces.

HBL continues its journey of cultural transformation to have engaged, digitally savvy and customer-centric staff to deliver its strategy. The Bank’s management trainee and graduate trainee programs, The League remain amongst the most sought-after in the industry and help to build a high-potential talent bench strength. Additionally, entry-level batch hiring for certain targeted roles helped to add capacity. As part of capability building, over 500,000 person-hours of training were delivered to keep employees’ skills updated in line with global best practices and market needs. In pursuit of the Bank’s customer-centricity goals, customer service and compliance training were at the top of the agenda. As part of the drive to continue embedding HBL’s Values in the organization, 2022 annual performance assessments for all employees also included a formal evaluation of how well they demonstrated the expected behaviours.

# Risk Management Framework

HBL’s strategy is underpinned by the proactive management of risk. HBL fosters a strong risk culture through a comprehensive management of risks, applicable to all levels of the organization with close Board oversight, multi-tier management supervision, efficient systems and clearly articulated policies and procedures. As part of the governance structure, the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) monitors, assesses and manages the risk profile of the Bank on an ongoing basis. At senior management level, various risk committees are responsible for oversight and execution, while day-to-day risk management activities are delegated to different levels.

As the economy came under pressure during the year, time-tested credit management practices, including regular Early Alert Committee meetings and stress testing, helped to ensure the strength and resilience of the Bank’s credit portfolio. There was a continued focus on enhancing portfolio monitoring and implementing tools for early identification of risks, particularly within the SME, Agriculture and Consumer lending portfolios. New credit scorecards were developed for Consumer and Agriculture and refresher training was provided to credit teams across the country. Risk management systems continued to evolve to facilitate business growth whilst limiting the effect of any residual risks.

To further develop bench strength and provide structured risk management training, HBL has introduced a comprehensive modular training program. The objective is to develop a uniform credit risk assessment mindset that is focused on forward-looking risk drivers, and hence adopt a proactive, rather than a reactive approach based on historical data. The program has been developed in-house and is being delivered by the Bank’s senior resources.



HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

# Market and Liquidity Risk Management

Market and liquidity risk indicators are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Market & Liquidity Risk Committee and by ALCO. A comprehensive structure is in place to ensure that the Bank remains within its tolerance for market risk.

# Operational Risk Management

Policies and procedures are in place to govern operational risk management in a systematic and consistent manner. Key tools such as Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Key Risk Indicators and Operational Loss Data Management are used to gauge the likelihood and severity of operational risk incidents. The Bank’s operational risk profile and fraud risk assessment are regularly shared with senior management and the BRMC.

# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function was a key area of management focus and continued to be strengthened during the year. ERM is applicable to all functions, which ensures a robust and consistent approach to risk management at all levels of the organization. The Bank’s ERM Framework, approved by the Board, outlines the high-level risk management principles and sets out the governance structure, standards, objectives and key responsibilities of different functions.

During 2022 the ERM team created a Bank-wide Integrated Risk and Control Repository (IRCR). The objective of this repository is to identify, manage, monitor and mitigate all risks and issues in a holistic way across the entire organization. As part of the implementation of the IRCR, self-testing by the first line of defence is being embedded across the organization. The ERM function also includes a Model Risk Management arm that aims to provide an independent review and validation of all models being used in the Bank.

# Compliance Function

The Compliance function’s role is to strengthen the compliance environment and manage compliance risk across the institution by enabling the Bank to comply with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and the Bank’s internal policies and procedures, including financial crime compliance (FCC) management. HBL places reliance on Compliance Risk Management (CRM) as a prudent mitigation strategy. Global Compliance, as an independent function, assists senior management in designing, implementing, and enabling the CRM framework in all relevant jurisdictions in liaison with businesses. The objective of this framework is to proactively manage regulatory instructions, requirements and expectations as well as to identify emerging compliance and financial crime risks.

Compliance, in liaison with business, identifies, assesses, monitors, and reports compliance risk through regulatory themed RCSAs. A comprehensive process of regulatory risk repository management has been implemented for ensuring adequate design and effectiveness of controls around regulatory requirements. During 2022, a weekly Regulatory Pulse was introduced as an information and monitoring tool for regulatory risk management and readiness assessment. Accordingly, enhancements were made to certain policies and procedures to create a more appropriate and enabling compliance framework.

# Emerging Regulatory and FCC Risks

The current volatile economic environment and the evolving geopolitical and regional situation have resulted in new emerging regulatory and FCC risks. Accordingly, Compliance instituted continuous engagement with internal customers through a series of Compliance On the Go roadshows across all regions. This was in addition to the rigorous specialized engagement sessions and trainings conducted bank-wide. In order to benchmark with global best practices, a validation and optimization project has been initiated for enhancing the effectiveness of existing transaction monitoring and sanctions screening systems.

# Global Compliance Structure

Global Compliance has recently realigned its organizational structure by enhancing compliance monitoring, digital enablement and innovation in order to seamlessly connect with the businesses whilst enabling the necessary touchpoints with regulators. The Ethics & Conduct function has also now been integrated within the Compliance function.

The Compliance Committee of Management, chaired by the President, monitors and reviews compliance and conduct related matters. The Board Compliance & Conduct Committee (BCNCC) supports the Board in overseeing the implementation of a compliance and conduct culture and provides governance over the implementation of a bank-wide compliance program.

# Whistleblowing Program

HBL’s whistleblowing program is directed at safeguarding the Bank’s integrity and reputation and aims to increase employee ownership in reporting suspected cases of fraud, corruption, harassment and other infringements of the Bank’s Code of Conduct. The BCNCC also oversees ethics and conduct related matters including whistle-blowing; any related investigations are overseen by the Board Audit Committee (BAC) and disciplinary actions are reviewed by the Board Human Resource & Remuneration Committee. During the year, further efforts were made to spread awareness of the various communication channels available for employee speak-up.

# Information Security

It is vitally important for HBL to protect its customers and their data from cyberattacks and data breaches. The Bank’s Information Security function plays a pivotal role in protecting HBL’s data assets from both internal and external threats through the effective management of cybersecurity risk, supported by preventive and detective controls capable of responding to emerging external threats. The Bank’s 24x7 Security Operations Centre continues to contribute to a robust security posture through various monitoring, detection, and preventive mechanisms.

Robust authentication and behavioral analytics of customers transacting over digital channels are essential controls in the prevention of cyber-frauds. A focused effort has helped the Bank to reduce the quantum of such incidents. The Bank also successfully completed the annual requirement of demonstrating compliance to the SWIFT Customer Security Program as well as ISO 27001 compliance. An extensive internal awareness campaign was launched to provide training and guidance on information security related matters and was supplemented by targeted awareness campaigns for customers. The Bank is committed to strengthening cyber-defenses through the use of automation and modern technologies, including AI and machine learning, while proactively mitigating against advanced security threats. These security measures allow HBL to continue offering innovative digital solutions to its clients while ensuring them protection and peace of mind.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
HBL makes a concerted effort to operate in ways that enhance the well-being of society, and that emphasize compassion and sharing, a spirit that we inculcate in our employees as a socially responsible organization. Contributing to the communities in which we operate is one of the pillars of our strategic agenda. The majority of HBL’s giving is done through the HBL Foundation (HBLF), under strict evaluation criteria to maintain transparency, quality and legitimacy, and to monitor and measure the impact and sustainability of each grant. The Foundation seeks out organizations that help underserved and underprivileged communities to navigate a future where at least basic individual needs are met. HBLF completed a decade of giving in 2021; in 2022, its philanthropic funding was increased to 1.5% of the Bank’s profit after tax.

In 2022, HBL directly contributed Rs 133 million, the bulk of which was on flood rehabilitation efforts in Sindh and Balochistan. In its immediate response the Bank, in partnership with Jubilee Life Insurance and Jubilee General Insurance, distributed relief supplies worth Rs 180 million to over 10 communities across both provinces. These included 15,000 ration bags providing up to 8 million meals, 4,000 mosquito nets, and 3,100 family-sized water-proof tents. The floods accentuated the problem of access to safe drinking water for which HBLF provided Rs 10 million for the distribution of 2,500 water filtration kits. HBL partnered with the Government of Pakistan and the National Disaster Management Authority, to disburse emergency relief funds under the BISP umbrella to 1 million flood affectees. HBL and its staff went above and beyond in the face of this humanitarian crisis, defying challenges of mobility and approachability to ensure that the impacted population was helped in any way possible. HBL also contributed Rs 128 million to build 100 prefabricated houses in each of two villages in the Larkana area.

In 2022, HBL Foundation donated Rs 349 million to 31 organizations operating in the areas of healthcare, education, community development, arts and culture across Pakistan. Rs 252 million were contributed to the healthcare sector for lifesaving medical equipment, tertiary healthcare for children, and eye and surgical camps. Amongst others, support was provided to the Sundas Foundation’s whose Iron Chelation Therapy program will benefit 200 Thalassemia patients a year, a mobile hospital that benefits 500 people per week in the remotest areas of Punjab, and a pediatric center in PIMS Islamabad for preventive, emergency, and primary childcare.

The Foundation donated Rs 76 million for the provision of education, technical and vocational programs to students across Pakistan. In 2022, HBLF also launched Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) scholarships for girls from underserved communities. 5 scholarships each were given to the National University of Sciences and Technology and to the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

HBL Foundation also supports interventions related to art, music and culture. All Pakistan Music Conference, a Karachi-based not-for-profit, was provided a grant for an archiving project called Living Masters that aims to document the art, journey, and relationships of legendary musicians in Pakistan through interviews and masterclasses.

To ensure the inclusion of a diverse set of communities, Rs 5.5 million were granted for procurement and distribution of rations to 1,000 Christian, Hindu, Fisherfolk, and Transgender families. These disbursements were carried out with the support of the Gender Interactive Alliance and Tehrik-e-Niswan and provided these families sufficient food for a month.

HBL encourages a strong spirit of volunteerism amongst its employees through a well-coordinated program that regularly identifies opportunities to serve. During the year, our staff stepped up to support a diverse range of activities including tree plantation, clean-up drives, blood camps and donating books and toys to the less fortunate.

# Credit Ratings

In June 2022, the Bank’s credit ratings were re-affirmed by VIS Credit Rating Company Limited at AAA/A-1+ for long-term and short-term respectively. The rating of the TFCs issued as Additional Tier 1 Capital in September 2019 has also been re-affirmed as AA+. The recently issued Additional Tier 1 Capital TFCs have been rated as AA+. The Outlook on all ratings is Stable. The ratings incorporate HBL’s position as the largest commercial bank in the country and reflect its strong financial and liquidity profile and systemic importance. VIS also pointed out that HBL’s strategy of enhancing its digital footprint remains a competitive advantage for the Bank. In October, Moody’s downgraded the sovereign rating from B3 to Caa1, with a Negative Outlook. It subsequently mirrored this action for the large Pakistan banks, including HBL.

# Future Outlook

At the start of 2023, Pakistan faces perhaps the most challenging economic conditions in its history. While the country has faced serious crises in previous eras, the current situation is complicated by the sheer magnitude of the fiscal and monetary challenges. Structural shortcomings that have built up over several decades have finally come home to roost, resulting in an import-dependent economy which has continued to pile pressure on the external account and resulted in downgrades of Pakistan’s sovereign ratings.

The impact of these factors has been compounded by the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The combination of these two events have led to an upheaval in global supply chains and the concomitant rise of high and persistent inflationary pressures across the globe; a large-scale reduction in risk appetite on frontier markets such as Pakistan; and a realignment of geopolitical preferences. The low level of foreign exchange reserves has led to a de-facto rationing, resulting in supply bottlenecks across the economy, now even affecting exports. Companies are responding by cutting production and announcing layoffs, which will further depress demand and affect lives and livelihoods, all against a backdrop of entrenched inflation at levels not seen for nearly half a century.

32    HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

It is quite clear that the only pathway out of this situation is to rapidly conclude the 9th review of the EFF and seek a continuation of the IMF programme. A Staff Level Agreement with the Fund is now an existential necessity, and must be pursued with single-minded urgency. The government has belatedly agreed to many of the major conditionalities required by the Fund, including concessions on revenues (mostly indirect), and a reversion to a floating exchange rate regime. A resolution is likely to be accompanied by difficult social and political conditions, although we should see a gradual return of investor appetite, leading to a near-normalization of conditions over the next 12 – 18 months. Policymakers must now tread a sensible path towards meaningful structural reform and a way out of the current predicament.

HBL has successfully navigated the plethora of headwinds it has faced during the year. Successive record quarters have led to another record year with leadership positions further entrenched across most areas of our operations; results from the strong domestic franchise have been boosted by the international business also now delivering operating profitability. For the second year in a row, our achievements were recognised through our winning Pakistan’s most prestigious award, The Best Bank in Pakistan, at the IBP Banking Awards; at the same time HBL Microfinance won the elusive Best Microfinance Bank in Pakistan, a testament to its progress and the difference it has made in peoples’ lives. Our Transaction Banking business has won a number of awards; the fact that these are based on client feedback makes them even more meaningful. We dedicate these results to our customers, many of whom have banked with us across generations and who are at the heart of all we do.

HBL’s investments in technology over many years are coming to fruition; the more virtual way of life, originally forced upon the world by the pandemic, is now seen by customers as a means of accessibility and convenience. Increasing digitalization of our businesses has become a way of life for HBL, whether it be paperless consumer financing, remote digital account opening or gamified hiring and training. This year, we have again introduced a slew of innovative products that have revolutionized the digital banking space: WhatsApp banking, Tokenization, Mobile POS enablement and Pakistan’s first Islamic branchless banking proposition. From HBL Mobile to Konnect, e-commerce to QR payments, HBL continues to set benchmarks in customer uptake and usage, embedding its position as a technology company with a banking license – one that is shaping the digital landscape in the country.

HBL is an integral part of the nation’s fabric – as Pakistan’s premier financial institution, HBL keeps stepping up in every sphere to support the country. We remain obsessed with providing thought leadership across the full spectrum of the economy, working with the Government under a public-private partnership model. Our pioneering interventions in agriculture have had a dramatic impact on the lives of farmers and going forward we will scale this up even more rapidly. Our role in helping Pakistan exit the FATF grey list has been publicly acknowledged and lauded and we remain the go-to organisation in the country for disaster relief. In 2022, we extended our founding support to HBLPSL to a full decade – an event that has helped put Pakistan back on the map of world cricket and brought untold joy to tens of millions of Pakistanis. HBL continues to patronise the arts and artists, bring art into the public space and providing people from all walks of life opportunities to enjoy and appreciate art.

HBL continues to take bold initiatives to tackle the world’s most important issue – climate change – by continually raising the bar, even at the cost of foregoing business. Our ambition of achieving Net Zero by 2030 is our stake in the ground in pursuit of environmental commitments. We remain relentlessly focused on financial inclusion in all its aspects – inclusion of women through HBL Nisa and our own gender diversity targets; inclusion of the underserved through Konnect and microfinance; inclusion of the differently-abled through targeted hiring and facilities at our touchpoints; and inclusion of millennials through digital banking – to ensure a brighter future for Pakistan and Pakistanis. Among our most cherished recognition of all is having been named as The Most Inclusive Organization in Pakistan.

# Dividend

58 HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

ANNUAL STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 2022
A strong internal control system consists of a comprehensive framework along with robust processes, effective communication and a resilient monitoring mechanism, all designed to work in tandem to identify and timely mitigate the risk of not meeting the objectives of the Bank. It is the responsibility of the Bank’s management to establish an internal control system that facilitates effective and efficient operations in a well-controlled environment.

The management of the Bank has implemented an internal controls system, approved by the Board of Directors (BoD), to achieve effective and efficient operations, comply with applicable laws and regulations and ensure the reliability of financial reporting. However, even a well-designed system of internal controls has inherent limitations and therefore can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance regarding the effectiveness of controls. Internal controls also require continuous review and improvement to align them with the evolving environment and safeguard against emerging risks. The Bank increasingly relies on the use of technology, including Robotics Process Automation, to improve operating efficiencies, increase scalability and further strengthen the control environment.

The Bank’s internal control structure comprises of different levels of monitoring activities. The Bank follows the “three lines of defense” model, with the first line comprising of front office, customer-facing and enabling functions, the second line being Compliance, Risk and other control functions and the third line of defense being Internal Audit.

The first line’s role is to ensure that business risks are properly identified and mitigated, while ensuring that controls are operating effectively and corrective actions are implemented promptly. The Bank’s control functions, i.e. the second line, are responsible for conducting end-to-end reviews of processes, to identify gaps and ensure that timely remedial action is taken for their rectification. The second line, as part of its governance responsibilities, also sets policies and defines risk tolerance levels.

The Compliance function’s role is to strengthen the compliance environment and manage compliance risk across the institution by enabling the Bank to comply with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and the Bank’s internal policies and procedures. Compliance is responsible for advising on, and overseeing, the implementation of regulatory requirements and related policies, including financial crime compliance management. Accordingly, Compliance in liaison with the business, identifies, assesses, monitors and reports compliance risk through regulatory themed Risk & Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs). A comprehensive regulatory repository management process has been implemented for ensuring the adequate design and effectiveness of controls around regulatory requirements.

A Shariah Board (SB), established by the BoD, ensures a strong governance framework around the Bank’s Islamic Banking business. The Shariah Compliance Department within the Compliance function works under the direct supervision of the SB and conducts Shariah reviews on a sample basis, to monitor compliance with the SB guidelines and Shariah standards adopted by the SBP.

Risk Management is responsible for the development and implementation of risk-related policies and for monitoring the risks associated with various activities of the Bank. During the year, the Enterprise Risk Management function has created a centralized repository of all risks and controls. This repository is being used by the Bank to evaluate the operating effectiveness of controls, identify exceptions and report them at an appropriate level, thus enhancing the control environment. The Management Risk Committee, along with the Board Risk Management Committee, provides strategic guidance as per the Risk Management Framework.

The Compliance Committee and the Controls Committee (CC), both chaired by the President, monitor, review and provide oversight on regulatory and control related matters at the franchise level, to ensure that control observations and emerging risks are highlighted appropriately. For known gaps, remediation plans are reviewed and monitored by the respective committee to ensure that these gaps are addressed in a timely and effective manner. The Board Compliance & Conduct Committee (BCNCC) supports the Board in overseeing the

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 59


# Implementation of a Compliance and Conduct Culture

It provides governance over the implementation of a bank-wide compliance program. It also monitors the Compliance function’s mandate and ensures its capabilities to effectively manage the Bank’s compliance risks. The BCNCC reviews inspection reports from domestic and international regulatory authorities including time-bound management action plans to address identified issues.

Internal Audit, as the third line of defense, has unrestricted access to the Board Audit Committee (BAC) and provides independent assurance by conducting risk-based audits of activities and processes to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment. The annual internal audit plan for the Bank, including Shariah operations, is approved by the BAC, which monitors its progress and implementation. All significant findings of Internal and External Audit, with agreed management action plans and timelines, are reported to the BAC. Internal Audit tracks closure of all findings through validation of these agreed management actions and the status is regularly reported at the CC and the BAC. The BAC oversees the implementation of internal controls to ensure that any identified risks are mitigated to safeguard the interest of the Bank. The Bank complies with the SBP’s guidelines on the Internal Audit function.

The Bank also follows the SBP’s instructions on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and has documented a comprehensive ICFR Framework. The Bank’s External Auditors are engaged annually to provide a Long Form Report (LFR) on ICFR, which is presented to the BAC, along with the progress on rectification of identified issues. The Bank has conducted testing of financial reporting controls to ensure the effectiveness of ICFR throughout the year. All the deficiencies identified are procedural and are not expected to have a material impact on financial reporting.

Based on the results achieved from the ongoing testing of internal controls, and from audits conducted during the year 2022, management considers that the Bank’s existing system of internal controls, including ICFR, is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored. The management continues to identify areas for process improvement and strengthening of the Bank’s internal control system.

The Board of Directors has duly endorsed management’s evaluation of internal controls, including ICFR, in the Directors’ Report.

SHARIAH BOARD REPORT 2022

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Alhamdulillah, By the grace of Almighty Allah (Subhanahu Wata’ala), HBL Islamic Banking (HBL-IB) has completed another remarkable year of growth and success of Islamic Banking operations. HBL Islamic continues to expand its footprint across the country to serve the Islamic Banking needs for the society. We appreciate and acknowledge Management’s effort for making 2022 a remarkable year in terms of Islamic branch network expansion to 294 full-fledged Islamic Banking Branches. We expect growth of Islamic Banking outreach with the same pace in 2023 as well. HBL Islamic offers Shariah Compliant banking solutions by offering a variety of products and services to address the banking needs of all the business segments. During the year, business transformation through technology remained a priority of the Bank by way of launching of Islamic Mobile App and automating the process of Islamic Car Finance facility.

Moreover, Shariah Compliance Department ensured Shariah compliance on pre and post execution levels, through Shariah review of new and existing product programs, policies, agreements, structured process flows, Running Musharakah models, Manuals, Shariah queries, and Marketing material prior to Shariah Board approval. Moreover, Shariah Compliance Department conducted Shariah review of the financing portfolio on a sample basis, support functions, and branches to ensure that processes and execution of the documentation are aligned with the Shariah Board guidance and approvals.

# Shariah Opinion:

Based on Shariah compliance reviews of both local/international locations, External & Internal Shariah Audit reports, and explanations & realistic assurances given by the management, the Shariah Board is of the view that overall:

1. HBL Islamic Banking has complied with Shariah rules and principles in the light of Fatawa, rulings and guidelines issued by the Shariah Board.
2. HBL Islamic Banking has complied with directives, regulations, instructions and guidelines related to Shariah compliance issued by the SBP in accordance with the rulings of State Bank of Pakistan’s Shariah Board.
3. HBL Islamic Banking has a mechanism in place to ensure Shariah compliance in its overall operations.
4. HBL Islamic Banking has placed a satisfactory system to ensure that any earnings realized from sources or by means prohibited by Shariah have been credited to the charity account. HBL-IB has a well-defined system in place to utilize the charity properly.
5. HBL Islamic Banking has complied with the State Bank of Pakistan instructions on profit and loss distribution and pool management.
6. The level of awareness, capacity and sensitization of the staff, management and the Board of Directors in appreciating the importance of Shariah compliance in the products and processes of the Bank.
7. Shariah Board has been provided adequate resources enabling it to discharge its duties effectively.

# Recommendations:

Based on the opinion formed in the light of the Shariah compliance reviews of local and international locations and Internal/External Shariah Audit reports, we have the following recommendations:

- Physical Training: As per our assessment and in compliance with the regulatory requirement, Shariah Board recommends that three days annual refresher course over webcast should include at least one day classroom training session on “Basics of Islamic Banking”.
- Awareness Sessions: Arrange more Islamic Banking awareness sessions for the general public from the Bank’s platform to build a true image of Islamic Banking and remove misconceptions about Islamic banking.
- Retirement Saving Plans: Product development department should ensure availability of long-term savings and investment products, to enable the customer to invest and meet the needs of their future expenses viz a viz retirement plans, children marriages, higher education and Hajj/ Umrah etc.
- Staff Finance Facility: To assess the feasibility of Islamic staff finance facility options across the bank.
- Risk Mitigation through Takaful: A mix of takaful and conventional insurance coverage is in practice due to certain limitations of insurance industry. However, it is reiterated to make efforts for switching a higher percentage of financing portfolios towards Takaful (Islamic Insurance) at the earliest.

May Almighty Allah (Subhanahu Wata’ala) help us to practice Islamic Banking in True Spirit.

We have audited the annexed consolidated financial statements of Habib Bank Limited and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, and the consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of the Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

| 1      | Provision against advances Refer notes 4.4 and 9.5 to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policy and particulars of provision against advances. | Our audit procedures for domestic advances included:- Assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of manual and automated controls over classification and grading of customers, including:

* The accuracy of data input into the system used for credit grading;
* The ongoing monitoring and identification of advances displaying indicators of impairment and whether they are migrating on a timely basis to early alert or to higher risk grade;
* Identification of past due customers.

- For a sample of advances, where the management has not identified as displaying indicators of impairment, challenged the management’s assessment by comparing the historical performance, financial ratios and reports on security maintained and formed our own view whether any impairment indicators are present.

- Where management has identified as displaying indicators of impairment, assessed the number of days overdue and factors used for calculation of provision in accordance with the Prudential Regulations.

- For consumer advances, analysed the days past due report and factors used for calculation of specific provision required in accordance with Prudential Regulations.

- For consumer advances, where the management has not identified as displaying any indicators of impairment, compared the general provision calculated with provision required in accordance with Prudential Regulations.We issued instructions to the auditors of those components which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Impairment of loans and advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those components performed audit procedures to respond to the significant risk and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, also evaluated the work performed by the component auditors through their files review and discussions with them. |

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.




In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including



The disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Amyn Pirani.

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) from time to time.

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

The SBP, vide its BSD Circular Letter no. 10 dated August 26, 2002, has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property, for banking companies till further instructions. Further, the SECP, through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008, has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the SBP through various circulars.

The SECP has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, ‘Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits’ with effect from January 1, 2014. The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions.

IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, was notified by the SECP as applicable for accounting periods beginning from January 1, 2015. However, the SECP, through SRO 56(I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirement of consolidation under this standard and under Section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 is not applicable in the case of investments by a bank in mutual funds managed by its own asset management company and established under the trust structure. Therefore, investments by the Bank in mutual funds managed by HBL AMC are not consolidated, as would otherwise be required under the definition of control specified in IFRS 10.

# 2.4 Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Group for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. These are considered either to not be relevant or to not have any significant impact on these consolidated financial statements.

# 2.5 Standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, except for HBL MfB, where it is applicable from periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Bank has elected for the modified retrospective approach for restatement.

The financial statements of overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates used for the purpose of consolidation will continue to be based on the respective host country’s regulatory regime. For accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, banks will be required to comply with the SBP's application instructions for overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates in preparing the Bank’s consolidated financial statements.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 2.5.1, the Bank expects that adoption of new standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 2.5.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of the application of IFRS 9, taking into account the SBP’s application instructions. The assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to change at the time of recognizing the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9. In addition, there will be changes in the classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework under which the Board Audit Committee (BAC) is tasked with overseeing the implementation of IFRS 9. A Steering Committee for the implementation of IFRS 9, chaired by the CFO, is in place including representation from Risk, all front-line businesses, Operations and IT.

Risk Management has developed models / methodologies for calculating the Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF) for off-balance sheet exposures. These models shall be validated annually including:

- Expected credit loss (ECL) model design, data quality and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

Finance identifies, prepares and extracts the data required for the modelling of risk parameters and the ECL calculations. The Bank has also implemented an automated system for the calculation of ECL as prescribed under IFRS 9 guidelines issued by the SBP.

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity’s business model. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank has reviewed the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

# Equity Securities

Listed equity securities currently classified as held-for-trading will be classified as FVTPL.

For certain listed equity securities currently classified as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to classify them as FVOCI. Therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have an impact on initial adoption. However, in accordance with the requirements of the standard, gains and losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

The remaining listed equity securities will be measured at FVTPL. The AFS reserve related to those securities is currently part of Surplus on Revaluation of Assets and will be reclassified to retained earnings, hence, there will be no impact on overall equity.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. However, the SBP has allowed banks to carry these investments under the current Prudential Regulations, i.e. at the lower of cost and break-up value, till accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Certain debt securities currently classified as AFS and that pass the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at FVOCI as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and also to sell those investments. The remaining debt securities that pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cashflows.

Debt securities currently classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and that pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost.

Debt securities currently classified as HFT and certain debt instruments currently classified as AFS and which are not expected to pass the SPPI test, will be measured at FVTPL.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses resulting from potential default events.

Based on the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

For the purpose of ECL calculation, the Bank has used 5 years’ data till December 31, 2022. Going forward, data for one additional year shall be included until the Bank has at least 10-year data. For calculating ECL, the Bank shall classify its financial assets under the following three categories:

- Stage 1: Performing Assets: For financial assets where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since initial recognition, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
- Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: For financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but which are not credit impaired, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on lifetime ECL.
- Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: For financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date, the Bank shall recognize ECL using the higher of the lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 and the provision required as per the Prudential Regulations.

Under the SBP’s instructions, Government Securities and credit exposure in local currency guaranteed by the Government are exempted from the application of the ECL framework.

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or interest payments are past due:

- by 365 days or more for agriculture lending
- by 60 days or more for all other segments

Qualitative factors include, inter alia, unavailability of financial information and pending litigation.

At every reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset, in which case, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (Stage 2 or 3).

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation which will be incorporated as per the SBP’s revised format.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 9. This is an estimate and the actual impact on the Bank’s financial statements for the year 2023 will depend on the financial instruments that the Bank holds during that period and the economic conditions at that time, as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future.

# Classification and measurement

The classification of the Banks investments is expected to change as follows:

- Debt instruments amounting to Rs 228.910 billion will be reclassified from AFS to Amortised Cost.
- Equity securities amounting to Rs 1.784 billion will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL.

# Financial impact

The total estimated impact (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity as at January 1, 2023 is an increase of approximately Rs. 6.072 billion, representing:

- A decrease of Rs 8.265 billion in equity due to an increase in ECL.
- An increase of Rs. 14.337 billion in equity resulting from reclassification of investments as mentioned above.

# Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL on capital, the SBP has permitted banks to adopt a transitional approach to phase in the impact over a period of five years. The transitional arrangement applies only to ECL for stage 1 and 2 financial assets.

# Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group's financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. Classification of investments (note 4.3)
2. Valuation and impairment of investments, associates and joint venture (note 4.3)
3. Provision against advances (note 4.4)
4. Valuation and depreciation of fixed assets (note 4.5)
5. Valuation and depreciation of right-of-use assets and their related lease liability (note 4.6)
6. Valuation and amortization of intangible assets (note 4.7)
7. Valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.8)
8. Valuation of defined benefit plans (note 4.12)
9. Taxation (note 4.15)
10. Fair value of derivatives (note 4.21)

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

During the year, the Bank has reviewed its estimate of the useful life of Point of Sale (POS) terminals in its domestic operations and the useful life of intangibles in its China branches, which has resulted in a change in the Bank's estimate of their useful lives. These revisions have been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate as per the requirements of IAS 8 and accordingly, have been recognised prospectively in the consolidated profit and loss account from the current year. The impact of these changes is disclosed in note 10.2.1 and 11.3.3 respectively.

# 3 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

# 3.1 Accounting convention

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for:

- Certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims, which are stated at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation.
- Investments classified as held-for-trading and available-for-sale, which are measured at fair value.
- Derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, which are measured at fair value.
- Right-of-use assets and their related lease liability, which are measured at their present values.
- Net obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes, which are measured at their present values.

# 3.2 Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pakistani rupees, which is the Group's functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand Rupees.

# 4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year.

# 4.1 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances with treasury banks and balances with other banks.

# 4.2 Lending / borrowing transactions with financial institutions

The Group enters into transactions of reverse repos and repos at contracted rates for a specified period of time. These are recorded as under:

# 4.2.1 Purchases under resale agreements (reverse repo)

Securities purchased under resale agreements are not recognised as investments in the financial statements and the amount extended to the counterparty is included in lendings to financial institutions. The difference between the purchase price and the contracted resale price is accrued on a time proportion basis over the period of the contract and recorded as markup income.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 4.2.2 Sales under repurchase agreements (repo)

Securities sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised as investments in the financial statements and the liability to the counterparty is included in borrowings. The difference between the sale price and the contracted repurchase price is accrued on a time proportion basis over the period of the contract and recorded as markup / interest expense.

# 4.2.3 Bai Muajjal

Bai Muajjal transactions represent sales of Sukuks on a deferred payment basis and are shown in lendings to financial institutions except for transactions undertaken directly with the Government of Pakistan which are disclosed as investments. The difference between the deferred payment amount receivable and the carrying value at the time of sale is accrued and recorded as income over the life of the transaction.

# 4.3 Investments

The Group classifies its investments, other than its investments in associates and joint ventures, into the following categories:

# Held-for-trading

These are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term trading exists, or which are acquired for generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices or interest rate movements. Under normal circumstances, these securities are required to be sold within 90 days from the date of their purchase.

# Held-to-maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold till maturity.

# Available-for-sale

These are investments, other than investments in associates and joint ventures, that do not fall under the held-for-trading or held-to-maturity categories.

# 4.3.1 Initial measurement

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulations or market convention are recognised at the trade date. The trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the investment.

In the case of investments classified as held-for-trading, transaction costs are expensed through the profit and loss account. Transaction costs associated with investments other than those classified as held-for-trading are included in the cost of the investments.

# 4.3.2 Subsequent measurement

# Held-for-trading

Investments classified as held-for-trading are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is taken to the profit and loss account.

# Held-to-maturity

Investments classified as held-to-maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

# Available-for-sale

Listed securities classified as available-for-sale are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is recorded in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account (shown as part of equity in the statement of financial position) and is taken to the profit and loss account either when realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired.

Unlisted equity securities are carried at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per its latest available audited financial statements. The Bank may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional impairment needs to be charged beyond amounts already charged based on audited financial statements. Other unlisted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HABIB BANK LIMITED
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 4.3.3 Investments in associates and joint ventures

Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount is subsequently increased / decreased to recognize the investor's share of the investee's profit and loss and reserves subsequent to the date of acquisition. The share of the investee's profit and loss is recognised through the profit and loss account while the share of reserves is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income.

# 4.3.4 Impairment

The Group determines that available-for-sale listed equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of these investments below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there is evidence of deterioration in the financial condition of the investee, industry and sector performance and changes in technology. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

A decline in the carrying value of unlisted equity securities is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision for diminution in the value of debt securities held in Pakistan is made as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. Provision against investments by the Group's overseas operations is made as per the requirements of their respective regulatory regimes.

When a debt security, classified as available-for-sale, is considered to be impaired, the balance in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account is transferred to the profit and loss account as an impairment charge. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed through the profit and loss account.

When a debt security, classified as held-to-maturity, is considered to be impaired, the impairment is directly charged to the profit and loss account as held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the debt security, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision for diminution in the value of other securities is made after considering objective evidence of impairment. The Group considers that a decline in the recoverable value of its investments in associates and joint ventures below their carrying value may be evidence of impairment. Recoverable value is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value falls below the carrying value and is charged to the profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the carrying value of the investment in associates and joint ventures, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.4 Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Provision against advances by the Group's operations in Pakistan is made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations. Provision against advances by the Group's overseas operations is made as per the requirements of their respective regulatory regimes. Advances are written off in line with the Bank’s policy when there are no realistic prospects of recovery.

Since 2020, several borrowers have been severely impacted, initially by the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, by the stressed economic conditions. The potential impact of the economic stress is difficult to predict, as many such borrowers have also availed the SBP enabled deferment / restructuring & rescheduling relief. Hence, management feels that it is appropriate to maintain an additional general provision on the domestic, funded performing credit portfolio excluding:

- Government guaranteed exposure
- Consumer and staff lending
- Exposure secured by cash / near cash collateral

This additional provision as at any statement of financial position date, is based on management’s best estimate and can be up to a maximum of 1% of the above mentioned portfolio. HBL MfB also maintains an additional general provision, based on management's best estimate, in respect of the portion of its microfinance portfolio which has been deferred, restructured or rescheduled under the SBP scheme and on account of the devastating floods in 2022 which have impacted customers in its area of operations.

# 4.4.1 Finance lease receivables

Leases where the Group transfers a substantial portion of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the future lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. The net investment in finance lease is included in advances.

# 4.4.2 Islamic financing and related assets

Murabaha financing is a cost plus profit transaction. Funds disbursed for the purchase of goods are recorded as an advance against Murabaha. Once the goods are sold to the customers, the transaction is recorded as financing. Goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold are recorded as inventories.

The financing is recorded at the deferred sale price. Profit earned on financing is recognised as unearned income and amortised into the profit and loss account over the term of the Murabaha financing. It is possible for Bank to buy the inventory on customer's behalf and sell it to the customers on spot basis. In this case, the entire profit is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

Under Ijarah financing, the Bank transfers the rights to use an asset to the customer for an agreed period for an agreed consideration. Assets given under Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, residual value and impairment losses, if any. The depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the term of the Ijarah after taking into account the estimated residual value. Impairment of Ijarah assets is recognised in line with the Prudential Regulations or upon the occurrence of an impairment event which indicates that the carrying value of the Ijarah asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The Ijarah rental received / receivable is recognised as income on an accrual basis.

Gains or losses on disposal of Ijarah assets are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.

For Running Musharakah the Bank and the customer enter a Musharakah (transaction or business partnership arrangement) where the Bank agrees to finance the operating activities of the customer's business and share the profit or loss at a pre-agreed ratio. Profit is provisionally recognised on an accrual basis and is adjusted once the customer declares the final profit after issuance of audited financial statements.

Under Diminishing Musharakah financing, the Bank and the customer create joint beneficial ownerships over tangible assets to fulfill the customer's capital expenditure / project requirements. The Bank receives periodic payments, partly for renting its portion of the assets to the customer and partly for the gradual transfer / sale of its share of ownership to the customer. The rental payment is recognised as profit while the asset transfer / sale payments are applied towards reducing the outstanding principal.

Under Istisna financing, the Bank gives an advance to customers for manufacturing goods and may allow their sale immediately after the goods are manufactured or allow a pre-agreed time to sell the goods on deferred payment basis as the Bank's agent to a third party. Profit is recognised at the time when the goods are sold to the third party. In case of a deferred sale, the profit is recognised on an accrual basis over the term of the financing.

Under Tijarah financing, the Bank purchases finished goods from the customer against payment, takes possession and appoints the customer as an agent to sell these goods to the ultimate buyer, generally on a deferred payment basis. Goods purchased by the Bank and sold by the customer on a deferred payment basis are recognised as financing while goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold by the customer are recorded as inventories. Profit on the financing is recognised on an accrual basis over the period of transaction.

Wakalah is an agency contract in which the Bank provides funds to a customer to invest in a Shariah compliant manner. This is recorded as financing and profit is recognised on an accrual basis and is adjusted once the customer declares Wakalah business performance.

Salam is a sale whereby the Bank undertakes to supply some specific commodity (ies) or asset (s) to the customer at a future date in exchange for an advance price fully paid on spot.

Currency Salam is an exchange or sale of a currency with another currency at a future date, at conversion rate within the spot range on the day of such contract execution.

Under Musawamah financing, the Bank purchases the goods and, after taking possession, sells them to the customer at an agreed price without disclosing the cost. Goods purchased by the Bank can either be sold to the customer as a spot transaction or on a deferred payment basis. Goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold are recorded as inventories.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 4.5 Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amounts, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Land, capital work-in-progress and works of art are not depreciated. Other items included in fixed assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation is calculated to write down the assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these consolidated financial statements. Depreciation on additions is charged from the month in which the assets are available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognised in the profit and loss account, such increase is also recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets account. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against any additional surplus on revaluation and the net carrying value is restated at the revalued amount of the asset.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) is transferred to unappropriated profit to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred. Major repairs and renovations that increase the useful life of an asset are capitalised. Gains or losses arising on the disposal of fixed assets are included in the profit and loss account. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of fixed assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.6 Right-of-use assets and their related lease liability

# 4.6.1 Right-of-use assets

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets (ROU) are measured at an amount equal to the initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located to its original condition. ROU assets are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation / accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability. Such remeasurement only occurs in cases where the terms of the lease are changed during the lease tenor.

ROU assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over a period starting from the commencement date of the lease contract to the end of the estimated useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier. The estimated useful lives of ROU assets are determined on the same basis as that for owned assets. Depreciation on additions (new leases) is charged from the month in which the leases are entered into. No depreciation is charged in the month in which the leases mature or are terminated.

# 4.6.2 Lease liability against ROU assets

Lease liabilities against ROU assets are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, then at the applicable incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and a finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit and loss account as markup expense over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

# 4.7 Intangible assets

# 4.7.1 Intangible assets other than goodwill

Intangible assets having a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Amortisation is calculated to write down the assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives at the rates stated in note 11.1 to these consolidated financial statements. Amortisation on additions is charged from the month in which the assets are available for use. No amortisation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off. The residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 4.7.1 Intangible Assets

Intangible assets which arise from contractual or other legal rights on the acquisition of another entity and are deemed separable are considered as part of the net identifiable assets acquired. These are initially measured at fair value. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their expected useful lives and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at cost less impairment, if any. Such intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, as per the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. An impairment charge in respect of intangible assets is recognised through the profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the extent of the impairment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.7.2 Goodwill

Goodwill arises in a business combination and is initially recognised at fair value as the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the specifically identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is subsequently carried at its initially recorded amount less impairment, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, as per the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. An impairment charge in respect of goodwill is recognised through the profit and loss account.

# 4.8 Non-banking Assets Acquired in Satisfaction of Claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recorded at cost and are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued with sufficient regularity by professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase in the market value over the acquisition cost is recorded as a surplus on revaluation. A decline in the market value is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment. A subsequent increase in the market value of an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the impairment and thereafter credited to the surplus on revaluation of that asset. All direct costs of acquiring title to the asset are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.

Depreciation on assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on the Group’s owned fixed assets. If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately. These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realised on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realised on the sale of fixed assets. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit. However, if such an asset, subsequent to initial recording, is used by the Group for its own operations, the asset, along with any related surplus, is transferred to fixed assets.

# 4.9 Borrowings / Deposits

Borrowings / deposits are recorded at the amount of proceeds received. The cost of borrowings / deposits is recognised as an expense on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred.

# 4.10 Subordinated Debt

Subordinated debt is recorded at the amount of proceeds received. Mark-up accrued on subordinated debt is charged to the profit and loss account.

# 4.11 Acceptances

Acceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. Acceptances are recognised as a financial liability in the statement of financial position with the contractual right of reimbursement from the customer recognised as a financial asset.

# 4.12 Employee benefits

The Bank operates a number of post-retirement benefit plans, which include both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.

For defined contribution plans, the Bank pays contributions to the fund on a periodic basis, and such amounts are charged to the profit and loss account when the payment obligation is established. The Bank has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

For funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets as at the statement of financial position date. Contributions to the fund are made by the Bank on a periodic basis.

For non-funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligations as at the statement of financial position date.

The liability in respect of all obligations under defined benefit schemes is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses that arise out of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on remeasurement of the liability for compensated absences are recognised in the profit and loss account.

# Past Service Cost

Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment and is recognised through the profit and loss account when the plan is amended.

# Current Service Cost

Current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period, and is recognised through the profit and loss account.

# 4.13 Foreign currency

# 4.13.1 Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into rupees at the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into rupees at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the statement of financial position. Forward transactions in foreign currencies and foreign bills purchased are translated at forward foreign exchange rates applicable to their respective maturities.

# 4.13.2 Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Pakistani rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the statement of financial position. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Pakistani Rupees at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity by an overseas subsidiary is treated as an asset of the overseas subsidiary and is translated at foreign exchange rates prevailing as at the date of the statement of financial position.

# 4.13.3 Translation gains and losses

Gains and losses arising from foreign currency translations are taken to the profit and loss account, except those arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign branches, associates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, which are recognized through the statement of other comprehensive income as an Exchange Translation Reserve (ETR). Balances in the ETR are only taken to the profit and loss account on disposal of the investment.

# 4.13.4 Contingencies and Commitments

Commitments for outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts are disclosed in the financial statements at contracted rates. Contingent liabilities / commitments denominated in foreign currencies are expressed in rupee terms at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the statement of financial position.

# 4.14.1 Advances and investments

Income on performing advances and debt securities is recognised on a time proportion basis as per the terms of the contract. Where debt securities are purchased at a premium or discount, such premium / discount is amortised through the profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective yield method. Income recoverable on classified advances and investments is recognised on a receipt basis. Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognised as permitted by SBP regulations or by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Group operates.

# 4.14.2 Lease financing

Income from lease financing is accounted for using the financing method. Under this method, the unearned lease income (defined as the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value less the cost of the leased assets) is taken to income over the term of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in the lease. Gains and losses on termination of lease contracts are recognised through the profit and loss account when these are realised. For classified leases, unrealised lease income and other fees are recognised on a receipt basis.

# 4.14.3 Fee, Commission and Brokerage Income

Fee, commission and brokerage income is recognised on an accrual basis.

# 4.14.4 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the dividend is established.

# 4.15 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises of the charge for current and prior years and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

# 4.15.1 Current

The charge for current taxation is calculated on taxable income earned during the year from local as well as foreign operations using tax rates enacted as at the date of the statement of financial position.

# 4.15.2 Prior years

The charge for prior years represents adjustments to the tax charge for prior years, arising from assessments, changes in estimates, and retrospectively applied changes to law, made during the current year.

# 4.15.3 Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deductible temporary differences (deferred tax assets) are temporary differences that are deductible from the taxable income of future periods when the carrying amount of the underlying asset or liability is recovered or settled. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Taxable temporary differences (deferred tax liabilities) are temporary differences that will result in a tax liability in future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to be applicable to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the date of the statement of financial position. The Bank also records a deferred tax asset / liability on items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income such as surplus / deficit on revaluation of assets and actuarial gains / losses. These items are disclosed net of the related deferred tax asset / liability. Deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for impairment. Where objective evidence exists that the carrying value of a deferred tax asset may not be recoverable, the deferred tax asset is reduced to its recoverable value. The difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value is recognised through the profit and loss account as a deferred tax expense.

# 4.16 Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised through the profit and loss account whenever the recoverable value of an asset is lower than its carrying value. A subsequent increase in the recoverable value of the asset results in a reversal of the impairment loss through the profit and loss account, up to the original carrying value of the asset, if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.

# 4.17 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. A provision for off balance sheet obligations is recognised when the Bank becomes aware of the obligation and reasonable certainty exists that the Group will settle the obligation. The charge to the profit and loss account is stated net of expected recoveries and the obligation is recognised in other liabilities. Provisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 4.18 Contingent Liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position as they are possible obligations where it has yet to be confirmed whether a liability, which will ultimately result in an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation, will arise. In cases where the probability of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote, it is not disclosed as a contingent liability.

# 4.19 Off setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are set-off and the net amount is reported in the consolidated financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously.

# 4.20 Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities carried on the statement of financial position include cash and bank balances, lending to financial institutions, investments, advances, certain other receivables, bills payable, borrowings, deposits, subordinated debt, lease liabilities against ROU assets and certain payables. The particular recognition methods adopted for significant financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the relevant policy notes.

# 4.21 Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at their fair values using appropriate valuation techniques. Derivative financial instruments are carried as an asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is taken directly to the profit and loss account.

# 4.22 Dividends and appropriation to reserves

Dividends and appropriations to reserves, which are approved subsequent to the date of the statement of financial position are, except where required by law, recognised in the year in which these are approved and disclosed as a non-adjusting event after the balance sheet date.

# 4.23 Earnings per share

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the year attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is not calculated separately, as the Bank does not have any convertible instruments in issue.

# 11.3.1

The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations and IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Habibsons Bank Limited in 2011 and represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill is allocated to the Wealth Management cash generating unit (CGU) which is the segment that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the CGU’s value-in-use (VIU) and its fair value less costs to sell.

The recoverable value of goodwill was determined based on VIU calculations. VIU is calculated as the present value of the CGU’s approved pre-tax cash flows, covering a period of five years and a terminal value based on a perpetuity, calculated using long-term GDP growth rates. All cash flows are discounted using a discount rate which reflects the risks appropriate to the CGU. As at December 31, 2022, the recoverable value of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount.

The following table sets out the key assumptions which were used for the determination of the value-in-use of goodwill. These are consistent with industry forecasts and are management's best estimates of the future performance of the segment.

# 11.3.2

The carrying value of goodwill and management rights is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations and IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Goodwill and management rights arose on the acquisition of PICIC Asset Management Limited by HBL Asset Management Limited (HBL AMC) in 2016. Management rights represent the present value of the income stream from the rights to manage the acquired funds. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.

The funds under management acquired from PICIC have been considered as one cash generating unit (CGU). Goodwill and management rights are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill and management rights are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount for both goodwill and management rights is calculated as the higher of the CGU’s value-in-use (VIU) and its fair value less costs to sell.

The recoverable value was determined based on VIU calculations. VIU is calculated as the present value of the CGU’s approved pre-tax cash flows, covering a period of ten years and a terminal value based on a perpetuity, calculated using long-term GDP growth rates. All cash flows are discounted using a discount rate which reflects the risks appropriate to the CGU. As at December 31, 2022, the recoverable value of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount.

The Bank operates a non-funded scheme for post-retirement medical benefits for all employees. All clerical employees who retired before May 24, 2022 receive reimbursements when incurred, against this benefit. Those who retired on or after May 24, 2022 also have the option to receive a one-time lump sum payment in lieu of reimbursements. Executives and officers who retired prior to January 1, 2006 receive these benefits as reimbursements when incurred. Executives and officers who retire after January 1, 2006 receive a one-time lump sum payment. However, those who are given a post-retirement contract up to the age of 65 years with effect from September 1, 2022, will receive this one-time lump sum payment at the time of expiry of the employment contract.

# 36.1.4 Compensated Absences (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates a non-funded scheme for compensated absences. This is applicable to those employees who were in the service of the Bank as at December 31, 2008 and who had accumulated leave balances. Employees are entitled to proceed on Leave Prior to Retirement (LPR) to the extent of their accrued leave or 365 days whichever is lower, while continuing to receive their gross salary. This benefit vests on retirement or, in the case of premature retirement, on the completion of 30 years of service. However, in the case of death in service, the benefit is encashed up to 50% of accrued leave or 180 days, whichever is lower. Employees may be required by the Bank to continue working during the whole or a part of their LPR period. Such employees are entitled to salary and certain benefits during the period they are required to work and, additionally, to leave encashment up to 50% of their accrued leave balance, up to a maximum of 180 days. Clerical employees have the option of not proceeding on LPR and instead encashing 50% of their accumulated leave balance up to a maximum of 180 days.

# 36.1.5 Other Post-Retirement Benefits (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank offers a non-funded scheme for executives. Under this scheme, a lump sum amount equal to six months of house rent, utilities, car and conveyance allowances is paid to the executive on retirement. However, in the case of death in service, the lump sum amount includes an additional six months of house rent allowance.

# 36.1.6 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates a pension and life assurance scheme for those employees who joined its UK operations prior to December 26, 2001. The scheme was established with effect from May 1, 1978 under a Trust Deed of that date and is governed by that Trust Deed together with various supplemental and amending deeds executed over the lifetime of the scheme. The triennial actuarial valuation as at May 1, 2019 revealed a deficit of £1.7 million under the Statement of Funding Principles. In order to address this deficit, the Bank will pay the amount after receiving regulatory approval.

# 36.4.12 The significant risks associated with the defined benefit schemes are as follows:

- Mortality risks: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.
- Investment risks: The risk that the investments of the Funds will underperform and not be sufficient to meet the liabilities.
- Final salary risks: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is higher than what was assumed. Since the benefit is calculated based on the final salary, the benefit amount increases similarly.
- Withdrawal risks: The risk of higher or lower withdrawal experience than assumed. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.

# 40 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices.

The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the break-up value of the investee company.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities: The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices taken from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities: Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).

# 44.1 Capital management

The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, depositor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business, while providing adequate returns to shareholders.

The Group’s lead regulator, the SBP, sets and monitors capital requirements for the Bank and the Group. The Bank's branches and subsidiaries outside Pakistan are also required to follow capital requirements applicable in their respective jurisdictions.

The SBP, through BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has required that Banks should maintain a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 10 billion (net of accumulated losses). The paid-up capital of the Bank as at December 31, 2022 stood at Rs. 14.669 billion (2021: Rs. 14.669 billion) and is in compliance with SBP requirements.

The Group and its individually regulated operations are in compliance with all capital requirements.

The Group’s regulatory capital is classified as follows:

- Tier 1 capital comprises of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) and Additional Tier 1 (AT 1) capital.
- CET1 capital includes fully paid-up capital, balance in share premium account, reserves (excluding exchange translation reserves), unappropriated profit and non-controlling interest meeting the eligibility criteria.
- AT 1 capital includes perpetual TFCs meeting the prescribed SBP criteria.
- Tier 2 capital includes general provisions for loan losses, surplus / (deficit) on revaluation of fixed assets and investments, exchange translation reserves.

Banking operations are categorised as either Trading Book or Banking Book, and risk-weighted assets are determined according to specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to on and off-balance sheet exposures.

On and off-balance sheet exposures in the banking book are segregated into various asset classes for the calculation of credit risk. Ratings reflecting the credit worthiness of counterparties are applied using various External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) and are aligned with appropriate risk buckets. Collateral, if any, is used as an outflow adjustment. Eligible collateral used includes Government of Pakistan (GoP) guarantees, GoP issued securities, bank guarantees, lien on deposits and margin accounts. Risk weights notified by the SBP are applied to net exposures to arrive at risk weighted assets.

The Group calculates capital requirements for market risk in its trading book based on the methodology provided by the SBP, which takes into account interest rate risk using the maturity method, equity position risk and foreign exchange risk.

# 45 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

HBL has a well-developed and robust risk management framework, appropriate for its size, regional and target market diversification and the high complexity of its operations. The Bank’s risk management framework includes a clearly documented risk appetite, well-articulated policies and procedures and a multi-tier management supervision, supported by strong Board oversight.

The Board of Directors provides the strategic direction for effective risk management and ensures that a robust risk management framework is in place, covering all aspects of the Bank’s operations, including the required human resources, policies, procedures, and systems, and is updated regularly to safeguard the Bank against emerging risks. It is supported in this task by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) as well as by various management committees.

For effective implementation of the risk management framework, the Risk Management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), operates independently of the business units within the Bank. Risk Management is responsible for the development and implementation of risk policies and for monitoring the risks associated with various activities of the Bank. The CRO reports to the President, with a functional reporting line to the BRMC.

The Risk Management function comprises of the following areas:

- Credit Approvals
- Credit Administration
- Program Based Lending Risk
- Market Risk & Financial Risk Modeling
- Enterprise Risk Management
- Risk Corporate Governance

# 45.1 Credit risk management

Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss stemming from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. While loans are the largest and most obvious source of credit risk, it also stems from both on and off-balance sheet activities. The credit process at the Bank is governed by well-defined and documented credit policies and procedures including separate policies for consumer loans, agriculture banking and SME financing. Certain types of exposures/ facilities are managed under product programs that contain their own detailed credit criteria, compliance and documentation requirements.

The Bank's credit risk appetite is defined through a Global Risk Appetite Statement that is approved by the Board. It also covers the concentration risks the Bank is willing to take with reference to risk ratings, sectors and large exposures.

The core pillars of credit risk management at the Bank are:

- Approval rules based on a three-initial system and joint Business / Risk sign-offs.
- An independent Internal Audit function which includes a Business Risk Review (BRR) unit.

Credit approval authorities are delegated to individuals based on their qualifications and experience. Disbursement authorization, collateral and security management, documentation and monitoring are managed by the Credit Administration Department. Proactive monitoring is ensured for assets under stress. This enables the Bank to put in place viable solutions to prevent further deterioration in credit quality. An independent Structured Credits and Remedial Assets function handles stressed assets and ensures a focused remedial strategy.

Credit risk management software to automate loan origination has been implemented domestically for Corporate, Commercial and Retail (non-program based) lending and is being rolled out to overseas locations. The software is designed to improve approval efficiency; enable capture, storage and retrieval of approval data; and generate MIS for decision making.

Stress testing on the credit portfolio is performed in line with SBP guidelines. In addition to the mandatory stress tests defined by the regulator, the Bank has also developed advanced stress tests for credit risk including macroeconomic stress tests and reverse stress tests to test the adequacy of the Bank's capital under various stress conditions. The Bank also regularly conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks.

The Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives including the establishment of a Financial Risk Modelling & Stress Testing unit to strengthen its credit risk management framework including in-house development, back testing, validation of credit risk scorecards, internal risk ratings (obligor risk rating and facility risk rating) and probability of default models for the portfolio. The performance of the risk rating models over the years is continuously monitored.

BRR performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an independent assessment of portfolio quality by reviewing the efficacy of the relevant processes, ensuring regulatory / policy compliance, and assessing the appropriateness of classification and risk ratings.

# 45.1.1 Credit risk - general disclosures

The Bank follows the Standardized Approach for its credit risk exposures, which sets out fixed risk weights corresponding to external credit ratings or type of exposure, whichever is applicable.

Under the Standardized Approach, the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to counterparties by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognized by the SBP. The Bank selects different ECAIs for each type of exposure. The Bank utilizes credit ratings assigned by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA), Vital Information Services (VIS), Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor's (S&P). The Bank also utilizes rating scores of Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).

| Types of exposure and ECAIs used | FITCH | Moody's | S\&P | PACRA | VIS | ECA scores |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ----- | --- | ---------- |
| Corporates                       | P     | P       | P    | P     | P   | -          |

| Public sector enterprises        | P     | -       | -    | P     | P   | -          |

For all exposures, the selected ratings are translated to the standard rating grades given by the SBP. The mapping tables used for converting ECAI ratings to the SBP rating grades are given below:

# 45.1.2 Credit Risk Mitigation under the Standardized Approach

The Bank has adopted the Simple Approach for Credit Risk Mitigation in the Banking Book. Under this approach, cash, deposits under lien, Government securities and eligible guarantees etc. are considered as eligible collateral. The Bank has detailed guidelines regarding the valuation and management of each of these types of collateral. Where the Bank’s exposure on an obligor is wholly or partially guaranteed by an eligible guarantee, the risk weight / credit rating of the guarantor is substituted for the risk weight of the obligor.

No credit risk mitigation benefit is taken in the Trading Book.

For each asset class, the risk weights as specified by the SBP or corresponding to the SBP rating grades are applied to the net exposure for the calculation of Risk Weighted Assets.

# 45.1.3 Country Risk

The Bank has in place a comprehensive Country Risk Policy. Limits are established for Cross Border Transfer Risk (CBTR) based on the ratings assigned by international rating agencies. CBTR arises from exposure to counterparties in countries other than the jurisdiction of the lender. Transfer risk arises where an otherwise solvent and willing debtor is unable to meet its obligations due to the imposition of governmental or regulatory controls restricting its ability to meet its foreign liabilities. The limit utilization is controlled at Head Office level and country risk exposures are reported to the BRMC at defined frequencies.

# 45.2 Market Risk Management

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to movements in market prices. It results from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices as well as from changes in the correlations between them. Each of these components of market risk consists of a general market risk and a specific market risk that is driven by the nature and composition of the portfolio.

The Bank is exposed to market risk in a number of ways. The largest component is Interest Rate Risk on the Banking Book, which refers to the interest rate risk that the Bank is exposed to due to mismatches in the repricing of its on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. The Bank also has a Trading Book in which the assets are marked-to-market through the profit and loss account.

The objective of the Bank's market risk management strategy is to assess an acceptable level of risk for each market variable (as stated in the Bank’s Risk Appetite Statement), and to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in these variables to optimize the Bank’s income streams.

Treasury and Global Markets is tasked with proactively managing exposures. The Bank's ALCO provides governance with respect to market risk exposures and limits, while monitoring and measurement is carried out by Market Risk Management (MRM).

MRM provides a dynamic and proactive approach to market risk monitoring, including the use of tools such as portfolio sensitivity, scenario analysis, stress testing and the use of Management Action Triggers (MAT) and limits.

# 45.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Bank manages this risk by setting and monitoring currency-wise exposure limits. The Bank’s assets in a particular currency are typically funded in the same currency to minimize foreign currency exposure. However, the Bank maintains a net open position in various currencies resulting from its transactions. Foreign exchange risk is controlled and monitored through limits approved by ALCO, within the overall limit advised by the SBP.

# 45.2.3 Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in the prices of individual stocks or the levels of equity indices. The Bank takes exposures to a range of equity instruments, and is exposed to losses arising from movements in equity prices. The Bank holds equity investments in both the AFS and HFT portfolios. The realization of short term capital gains is the principal objective of the HFT portfolio while the AFS portfolio takes a medium-term market view with the objective of earning both capital gains and dividend income. The portfolios are managed by the Bank within the structure encapsulated in the Equity Investment Policy approved by the Board, which defines position limits, portfolio limits and loss triggers for the equity desk. The Bank also applies stress tests on the equity portfolio which is part of the Bank’s overall market risk exposure limit on the trading book.

# 45.2.4 Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of the yield curve. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk in both the Trading and Banking Books. Interest rate sensitivity analysis is conducted at both Banking Book and Trading Book levels, at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. The analysis helps in estimating and managing the impact of interest rate volatility on the Bank’s earnings and on the economic value of equity within defined tolerance limits. Limits are also in place for fixed income investments of the treasury portfolio at dealer, transaction, portfolio and Trading / Banking Book levels. Regulatory stress testing is conducted on a quarterly basis. Metrics to assess Interest Rate Risk include Interest Rate Gap Reports, Earnings at Risk (EAR) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE). These metrics are also calculated based on different stress testing scenarios. To further strengthen interest rate risk management, the Bank has developed a standardized framework for computing the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under the updated guidelines issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Standards.

# 45.2.4.1 Mismatch of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

Interest rate sensitivity gaps for assets and liabilities which have contractual maturities have been reported based on the earlier of the re-pricing date or maturity date. Assets and liabilities which do not have any contractual maturities have been bucketed on the basis of a behavioural study conducted by Market Risk Management and approved by ALCO.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 45.3 Enterprise Risk Management

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function was set up in 2020, and is applicable to all functions within the Bank, thus ensuring a robust and consistent approach to risk management at all levels of the organisation.

The Bank’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, approved by the Board, outlines the essential ERM components, principles and concepts, and suggests the use of a common ERM language, while providing a clear direction and guidance for integrated risk management within the Bank. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is distributed through the delegation of accountability to individuals, with reporting and escalation facilitated through a governance structure. Standards, policies, and limits are well defined to ensure tasks and processes are consistently controlled.

During the year, a Bank-wide Risk and Control Repository has been created with the objective of identifying all risks and issues in a holistic manner across the entire organisation and ensuring that they are adequately monitored and mitigated.

The ERM function also includes a Model Risk Management unit that provides independent review and validation of all models being used in the Bank.

# 45.4 Operational Risk Management (ORM)

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

A comprehensive ORM Framework is in place which address all significant aspects of ORM. The Bank uses loss data management, Risk and Control Self Assessments and tracking of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to gauge the likelihood and severity of operational risk. The SAS software is used to facilitate this process. Operational Risk coordinators have been assigned from all departments of the Bank and are responsible for implementation of the Framework in coordination with the ORM department. An Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) monitors and oversees operational risk issues.

The Bank uses stress testing to proactively assess impacts to the Bank. RCSA exercises are conducted at regular intervals across the Bank. Operational risk reports are regularly submitted to the senior management and the BRMC.

# 45.4.1 Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

It is the policy of the Bank to maintain a well-defined business continuity plan with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and ownership for crisis management, to ensure business continuity and IT disaster recovery. The Bank’s Business Continuity Steering Committee, includes representation from the senior management of the Bank and is the governing body for BCP. It meets on a periodic basis to review key initiatives, testing results and action plans for strengthening the Bank’s ability to manage crisis situations. The Bank’s business continuity program complies with the regulatory framework and the leading Business Continuity Management standard, ISO 22301. The business continuity program is subject to regular internal, external and regulatory reviews and audits.

# 45.4.2 IT related controls

During the year, the Bank's IT controls were further strengthened, with special focus on controls around testing and quality assurance of all the products or solutions taken into production. Enhanced focus and visibility was given to IT Audit and Compliance, and several control / monitoring and technology hygiene initiatives were launched in close coordination with Internal Audit and Global Compliance. A formal procedure for IT Risk Management was introduced to identify and mitigate potential risks in a centralized manner. This has been further aligned with the Enterprise Technology Governance and Risk Management (ETGRM) framework. IT Risk Coordinators, aligned with the enterprise-wide Risk Coordinators have been introduced to ensure that risks are reported and coordinated regularly. An IT Risk Register has been developed to track and monitor IT risks; the process will be automated in 2023 aligned with other areas of the Bank.

Controls around ‘Cloud Computing’ were put in place as per the directives and framework provided by the SBP. IT introduced better visibility of its services management function by revamping existing processes and introducing new processes for effective controls and visibility across the Bank. The IT Steering Committee discipline was established at all international locations to bring efficiency and effectiveness in technology governance and operations.

# 45.4.3 Information Security Risk

It is vitally important for the Bank to protect its customers and their data from cyberattacks and to provide secure banking services. Information Security plays a pivotal role in protecting the Bank’s data assets from both internal and external threats through effective cyber security risk management, supported by preventive and detective controls capable of responding to emerging external threats.

Targeted and frequent information security awareness initiatives for customers and employees were launched using multiple delivery channels, to elevate their level of awareness and better equip them to counter security challenges. Significant progress has also been made in raising information security standards at international locations to a level consistent with the policies, standards, and controls implemented for the domestic business.

Moving forward, the Bank plans to strengthen its cyber-defenses through the use of automation and modern technologies, in particular, AI and machine learning. Furthermore, the Bank will work towards further alignment of its information security operations center with international best practices. Customers are an important component of the security process and continuous customer education about cyber risks will remain an important component of our defense strategy. These security measures will allow the Bank to continue offering innovative digital solutions to its clients while ensuring them protection and peace of mind.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 45.6 Derivatives Risk

The policy guidelines for derivatives exposures are approved by the Board on the recommendation of the BRMC. The responsibility for derivatives activity lies with the Treasury and Global Markets business. Measurement and monitoring of market and credit risk limits and exposure, and their reporting to senior management and the Board is done by Market Risk Management (MRM) which, in coordination with the business, also presents limits for review and approval to ALCO and the BRMC. Treasury Operations records derivatives activity in the Bank’s books, executes settlements of trades and carries out regulatory reporting to the SBP.

# 45.6.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of non-performance by a counterparty which could result in an adverse impact on the Bank’s profitability. The credit risk associated with derivative transactions is categorized into settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Pre-settlement and settlement risk limits for derivative transactions are determined and monitored daily using an approved framework.

# 45.6.2 Market Risk

The Bank, as a policy, hedges all Options transactions back-to-back. The Bank minimizes the exchange rate risk on its Cross Currency Swaps portfolio by hedging the exposure in the interbank market on a rolling basis. The Bank also manages the interest rate risk of Interest Rate Derivatives and Cross Currency Swaps through Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) limits which are monitored and reported by MRM to senior management on a daily basis. These limits are approved by ALCO annually and then approved by the Board on the recommendation of the BRMC.

# 45.6.3 Operational Risk

The Bank has put in place a robust control framework for derivatives transactions. Front office staff dealing in derivatives have the requisite training and experience to conduct this business; responsibilities have been divided amongst the Structuring Desk (tasked with the overall ownership of derivatives and structured products), Treasury Sales (who are involved in marketing and executing transactions with the Bank’s client base) and Trading (which proactively manages the risk from a business perspective). A detailed product program, approved by the Board, governs the entire value chain for derivatives, including credit and market risk management, booking, sales and settlement. There is a clear segregation of duties whereby operational aspects are handled by Treasury Operations, whereas all risk issues are the responsibility of the Risk department. A Treasury Middle Office function, reporting into Risk, carries out daily monitoring of exposures, while Compliance monitors any deviation from approved policies and procedures.

# 12 The Islamic Banking Business maintains the following pools:

General Pool PKR (Mudarabah)

Remunerative rupee deposits of customers form part of the General Pool. The objective of this pool is to effectively manage Rupee deposits of customers to earn and distribute returns from Rupee denominated earning assets. The funds in this pool are generally deployed in financing assets, placements with FIs and investments in Sukuks etc. A loss, if any, is borne by the depositors as per their proportionate share in the overall volume of the pool.

Special Pool PKR (Mudarabah)

HBL also manages a Rupee denominated Special Pool, with the objective of offering higher returns for selected clients. The objective of this pool is to effectively manage Rupee deposits of customers to earn and distribute higher returns from Rupee denominated earning assets. The funds in this pool are generally deployed in financing assets, placement with FIs and investments in Sukuks etc. A loss, if any, is borne by the depositors as per their proportionate share in the overall volume of the pool.

Treasury Pool(s) (Mudarabah / Wakalah / Musharakah)

Treasury pools are created when the Bank accepts placement of funds from FIs for liquidity management. Treasury pools may be based on the principle of Mudarabah, Wakalah or Musharakah. These pools are maintained separately from depositors’ pools as these are formed by funds from professional counterparties and are generally obtained for a shorter tenor. The liquidity can also be deployed to fund earning assets in the depositor pools. HBL preferably accepts funds from Islamic Banking Institutions but is permitted to deal with conventional banks as well.

General Pool FCY (Mudarabah)

Remunerative foreign currency (FCY) deposits of customers form part of the FCY General Pool. The objective of this pool is to effectively manage the FCY deposits of customers to earn and distribute returns, generally from FCY denominated assets. However, in case FCY denominated assets are not available, the Bank may invest these funds in local currency assets by converting the funds to local currency and charging the cost of Shariah compliant hedging to the pool. The funds in this pool are generally deployed in financing assets, placement with FIs and investments in Sukuks etc. Loss (if any) is borne by the depositors as per their proportionate share in the overall volume of the pool.

The objective of this pool is to effectively manage FCY deposits of customers to earn and distribute higher returns, generally from FCY denominated assets. However, in case FCY denominated assets are not available, the Bank may invest these funds in local currency assets by converting the funds to local currency and charging the cost of Shariah compliant hedging to the pool. The funds in this pool are generally deployed in financing assets, placement with FIs and investments in Sukuks etc. Loss (if any) is borne by the depositors as per their proportionate share in the overall volume of the pool.

# Islamic Export Refinance Scheme (IERS) Pool PKR (Musharakah)

IERS is an SBP program which offers the Islamic equivalent of conventional Export Refinance and enables exporters to avail refinance through Islamic Banks under Shariah compliant modes. This pool is created for the Export Refinance on Musharakah basis. The profit distribution works exactly the same as pre-agreed profit sharing. Since this is structured as a Musharakah (partnership) as opposed to Mudarabah (fund management), there is no Mudarib fee sharing mechanism.

The Mudarib's share of profit is 28.63% (2021: 25.88%) and, after netting of Hiba to depositors amounting to Rs 4.99 million (2021: Rs 504.73 million), amounts to Rs. 7.347 million (2021: Rs 3,657.724 million). For the Bank's overseas branch, the Mudarib's share of profit is 12.71% (2021: 7.75%) and, after netting of Hiba to depositors amounting to Rs 6.488 million (2021: Rs 3.124 million), amounts to Rs 4.280 million (2021: Rs 1.569 million) was booked as net profit for 2022.

# Profit Distribution Parameters

The following parameters are used for profit distribution from the pool:

- Permissible direct expenses can be charged to the relevant pool. Administrative and operating expenses are paid by the Mudarib and not charged to the relevant pool.
- The Bank first charges the proportionate profit to average equity allocated to the pools and then charges the Mudarib fee before distribution of profit to depositors.
- The Bank gives priority to depositors' funds over its own equity for placement in investing activities.
- Provisions for non-performing accounts are borne by the Mudarib. These are only charged to the respective pool on write off.
- Income generated from non-funded activities is not considered as income of the pool.

# Profit Rates

The average rate of profit earned on the earning assets of the Islamic banking business during the year was 12.80% (2021: 8.03%). A Profit rate of 7.65% (2021: 4.90%) was distributed to depositors and for overseas branch, the average rate of profit earned on the earning assets of the Islamic banking business during the year was 12.71% (2021: 7.75%). A Profit rate of 7.24% (2021: 3.50%) was distributed to depositors.

# DIRECTORS’ REPORT

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

# Macroeconomic Review

Following a high-growth phase in FY’22 when the economy expanded by 6.0%, FY’23 commenced with Pakistan’s worst-ever floods, causing an estimated damage of ~$32 billion. Pakistan’s challenges have been significant – the external front was impacted by rising commodity prices and debt repayments, exacerbated by delays in the IMF program, while the domestic economy came under severe pressure, compounded by a lack of political clarity. These factors have led to an overall slowdown in the economy with moderation in most high-frequency data. The Large-Scale Manufacturing Index posted a decline of 3.7% during 1HFY’23 and the SBP has warned of downside risks to even the 2% target for GDP growth.

In Jan’23, inflation surged on account of higher fuel and energy prices, food inflation and currency depreciation, registering a nearly 50-year high of 27.6%. Core inflation, which has been on a consistently rising trend, increased to 17.0%, reflecting the secondary impact of rising energy prices. Average inflation for 7MFY’23 is 25.4% vs 10.2% in the same period last year and is already much higher than the SBP’s FY’23 projection of 21% - 23%.

The global economic slowdown took its toll on Pakistan’s external sector. Exports fell by 7% in 7MFY’23, compared to the same period last year. The trade balance however, improved, as restrictions on luxury imports, fiscal and monetary tightening, and an overall slowdown in demand led to a 21% contraction in imports. The trade deficit for 7MFY’23 thus declined by 31% to $17 billion. With the gap between the interbank and the kerb rates widening, remittances decreased to $1.9 billion in Jan’23, the fifth successive month-on-month decline and the first sub-$2 billion level since May’20. For 7MFY’23, remittances of $16 billion were 11% lower YoY. However, the narrowing of the trade deficit supported the current account, with the 7MFY’23 deficit falling by 67% over 7MFY’22, to $3.8 billion.

Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves depleted to nine-year lows, falling to $2.9 billion by 3 Feb’23, amid delays in the IMF review. Most external financing avenues are now linked to the IMF Board approval. The completion of a number of prior actions, including additional taxation measures and further increases in fuel, gas and utilities prices should help move closer to the Staff Level Agreement. The deteriorating external account dragged the currency, which remained volatile throughout the year and ended the year 27% (Rs 48/$) lower. The recent restoration of a market-determined exchange rate caused a further downward spike with the Rupee falling by Rs 49/$ to Rs 275/$ before recovering slightly.

The primary surplus in 1HFY’23 improved significantly, both in absolute and percentage terms; this clocked in at 1.1% of GDP compared to 0.1% of GDP in 1HFY’22. Tax collections increased by 17% YoY in 1HFY’23, driven by a 50% increase in direct taxes. However, current expenditure increased by 30%, led by floods and a 77% increase in mark-up payments. The fiscal deficit for 1HFY’23 thus registered a 23% increase over 1HFY’22 to PKR 1.7 trillion, although it remained at 2.0% of GDP.

Equity markets saw another volatile year with the market shedding 2% during the last quarter and 9% from December 2021. Investor participation remained dull with low volumes as macroeconomic pressure, extended political uncertainty and a rapidly falling Rupee all weighed on sentiments. The exodus of foreigners continued, particularly in banking sector stocks as international investors sold $127 million over the year.

The central bank has continued to tighten monetary policy and, in the Jan’23 MPC, raised the policy rate by 100 basis points to 17%, a 25-year high. The SBP was of the view that inflation is broad-based and persistent, with core inflation on a rising trend for the past 10 months. Further, expectations have skewed upwards, and timely intervention was needed to lower them. It emphasised that the short-term costs of taming inflation are lower than the costs of allowing it to become entrenched. Industry advances and deposits were distorted in Dec’22 as banks raced to increase their Asset / Deposit Ratio to avoid punitive tax rates. For 2022, industry advances increased by 17% while deposits growth slowed to only 7%, with market deposits showing their first-ever fourth-quarter decline in Q4’22. Industry spreads in 2022 grew by 100 bps over 2021, reflecting the increase in benchmark interest rates and the continuing re-pricing of balance sheets.

# Financial Performance

In 2022, HBL has delivered its highest profit before tax of Rs 71.6 billion with a consistent growth trajectory throughout the year, backed by record quarterly profits. PBT is 21% higher than the PBT of Rs 59.0 billion last year. The Bank’s profit after tax, however, declined by 10% to Rs 30.9 billion, as a higher tax charge caused by excessive and retrospective taxation impacted the bottom line by Rs 10.3 billion. Earnings per share declined slightly, to Rs 21.04 in 2022 from Rs 23.36 in 2021.

HBL’s balance sheet grew by 7% to Rs 4.4 trillion. Domestic current deposits grew by Rs 203 billion, a 20% growth over the prior year, reaching Rs 1.2 trillion; low-cost savings accounts increased by Rs 136 billion. The Bank’s focused efforts to mobilize low-cost deposits and contain its cost of funds led to a record current account mix of 41.5% and a CASA ratio of 86.5%. Total domestic deposits reached Rs 2.9 trillion and HBL’s total deposits as of December 2022 rose to Rs 3.2 trillion.

In line with its stated intent of supporting customers throughout economic cycles, HBL helped its clients and the country navigate through extremely challenging times. Domestic advances grew steadily throughout the year, by Rs 241 billion.




# HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

to Rs 1.4 trillion, registering a broad-based growth of over 20% for the second consecutive year. The Bank’s flagship consumer portfolio increased to Rs 122 billion, and lending to the Commercial segment crossed a landmark Rs 100 billion. Agriculture financing is a key priority of the Bank and the portfolio reached an all-time high of Rs 50.6 billion. HBL’s total advances increased by 17.2% to Rs 1.6 trillion, with the ADR improving to 52.9%.

With rapid monetary tightening, net interest margins improved by 67bps over 2021 while the Bank achieved a Rs 500 billion growth in average balance sheet volumes. Consequently, net interest income grew by 26% to Rs 152 billion. Non-fund income grew by 25% to Rs 38.3 billion with a standout performance from all areas. HBL’s dominant fee franchise again delivered excellent results, rising 24% to Rs 27.7 billion. Its flagship Cards business continues to set new records, contributing nearly half the increase in fees and constituting nearly 50% of total fee income. Despite constraints, Trade income grew by 19% to Rs 3.2 billion. Investments in the Bank’s branchless banking initiative, Konnect, are now coming to fruition as Konnect generated fees of Rs 1.5 billion, more than double that in 2021.

HBL continues to invest in its people and its digital infrastructure to deliver innovative and unique customer solutions. HBL, as always, also stepped up to support the country and its people during the catastrophic floods that displaced millions of people. In 2022, total administrative expense increased to Rs 110.5 billion as unprecedented inflation affected costs across all categories. However, with a strong revenue base, the domestic cost / income ratio was maintained at the prior year’s level of 51.1%. Total provisions of the Bank increased marginally, to Rs 6.5 billion, as HBL prudently boosted previously created reserves, in order to insulate the Bank from the fallout of the current economic conditions. HBL’s infection ratio slightly improved from 5.1% to 5.0% while total coverage remained above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

With the strong results, internally generated capital grew by 10% in 2022. The massive Rupee devaluation of Rs 48/$ impacted the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) by 96 bps. As a result, HBL’s unconsolidated Tier 1 CAR declined to 12.8% while the total CAR reduced to 15.0%. Nevertheless, both ratios remain comfortably above current regulatory requirements; these were eased in December, as the SBP lowered the D-SIB buffer for all categories of banks by 50bps.

In December 2022, the Bank issued Rs 6.5 billion of perpetual term finance certificates, which qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital, thus boosting its Tier 1 CAR by 34 bps.

# Business Developments

In 2022, HBL attained a deposit market share of 13% with a domestic book of Rs 2.9 trillion, adding nearly 800,000 customers through its branch network. This included more than 135,000 new customers of HBL Asaan Account, a basic account targeted at enhancing inclusion; HBL now has over 1.1 million customers in this segment with a total deposit of over Rs 17 billion.





# New Product Launches

New product launches were based on a well-thought out needs analysis. The Bank introduced Mahana Amdan, a savings product aimed at retirees, offering higher returns with monthly profit payouts. HBL’s classic Freedom Account, which provides banking solutions to businessmen, was supplemented with an insurance offering that provides coverage against loss of cash and valuables as well as hospitalization coverage. The Bank crafted an offering to address the unique financial requirements of the agricultural segment which resulted in the launch of the Haryali Account in November 2022.

# Women’s Market Program

HBL proudly serves over 4 million women customers, including nearly 1 million under its internationally recognized women’s market program, HBL Nisa. During 2022, the program added nearly 160,000 new accounts with total Nisa deposits increasing by Rs 40 billion. The Bank also launched Nisa Asaan, an initiative targeted specifically towards the unbanked and underbanked women of Pakistan. To cater to the growing savings needs of women a mutual funds proposition was launched for women in collaboration with HBL Asset Management Company.

# Prestige Proposition

HBL’s Prestige proposition is designed to change the landscape of priority banking across Pakistan, serving affluent customers with a bespoke product suite in line with their sophisticated needs. Prestige is now offered at 38 lounges across 16 cities in Pakistan. In 2022, Prestige went international with its first lounge in Jumeirah, Dubai. In order to expand the offering’s scope, 400 regular branches were also enabled to onboard Prestige customers, offering them access to the value proposition, but without a dedicated footprint. As a commitment to product innovation and service excellence, Prestige offers fully automated lockers that are available to clients 24x7 in select locations. Vitality, an insurance product catering to the health and lifestyle needs of high-net-worth individuals was added to the Prestige product offering.

# Roshan Digital Account Initiative

The Bank continues to lead the industry on the Roshan Digital Account initiative, being the first to cross 100,000 accounts, with a 20% market share. Since inception, HBL has channeled over $900 million to the country through this initiative. The Bank remains the market leader for investments in Naya Pakistan Certificates as well as financing under the Roshan Apni Car and Roshan Apna Ghar programmes.

# Digital Account Opening Journey

To provide convenience to clients, the digital account opening journey was augmented to provide an enhanced and seamless onboarding, based on insights from customer experiences. The entire conventional branch network has been enabled to onboard clients to the Konnect platform. This has served the dual purpose of easing congestion at branches and enabling low-ticket accounts to be accessed and serviced via HBL’s extensive agent network.

# Bancassurance and Investment Services

Bancassurance regained its market leadership position with a 30% share of premiums written. Investment Services, which distributes HBL AMC’s funds, are now available in over 1,400 branches and achieved AUM sales of Rs 5 billion.

# Consumer Banking Performance

HBL’s Consumer Banking business had another stellar year with total consumer lending growing by 19% to Rs 122 billion. The credit cards business further consolidated its leadership with a growth of over 60% in card usage, achieving Rs 182 billion in spend and a portfolio size of Rs 24 billion, up by 47% over the previous year. HBL’s credit cards remain top-of-wallet with one out of every three Rupees spent on credit cards in Pakistan being on HBL. Over 90,000 new credit cards were issued in 2022, a 17% growth from 2021. The business also offered significant limit increases to assist qualifying customers in light of inflationary pressures.

# Debit Card Issuance

HBL has continued to solidify its position as the largest card issuer in Pakistan with one in every five people holding an HBL Debit Card, a total of 6.5 million debit cards issued. Spend volumes in 2022 increased by 58% to Rs 122 billion, of which 30% was at e-commerce merchants. The Tokenization or Tap and Pay feature was launched for credit cards in 2021; in 2022, this was enabled on MasterCard and Visa Debit Cards under the HBL Pay brand, allowing customers to pay by simply tapping their mobile phones at contactless enabled POS machines. The Bank expanded its POS network to more than 46,000 machines, the largest network in the industry. Throughput at HBL’s terminals grew by 46% to Rs 264 billion, accounting for more than a third of the country’s total sales volume.

# Personal Loans and Auto Financing

Personal Loans, with a portfolio of Rs 44 billion, continued to be one of the most important pillars of consumer financing with fresh disbursements of over Rs 28 billion in 2022. Ready Cash was established as a future growth product with ~Rs 3.5 billion of credit lines approved for around 6,000 customers. Despite external challenges being faced by the autos industry, HBL has maintained its leadership position in 2022, financing 11,200 cars – the highest in the market – and increasing market share from 11.5% to 12.4%.

# Digitalization Focus

HBL remains focused on digitalization to improve customer convenience with faster processing. In 2022, one third of credit cards and 23% of personal loans were booked through HBL Mobile, a paperless process with instant decisioning. Towards the end of the year, in yet another industry-first innovation, Digital Car Finance was launched and promises to be a game changer for the auto financing business.

# SME Business Growth

HBL is fully committed to investing and growing the SME business in a significant and sustainable way. In 2022, Advances grew by 20% to over Rs 89 billion; new and enhanced limits of Rs 35 billion were approved, 26% higher than in 2021. The SME customer base crossed 15,000, an impressive growth of 25%. The growth in scale and size has been primarily driven through enhancing sales capabilities, process simplification, use of technology and implementing scoring models for quick decisioning. The repositioning of the business has enabled faster growth with particular focus on small businesses that have a real impact on the economy. HBL has entrenched its leading position in the industry with market share increasing from 14.1% to 16.5% in 2022.

# New Products for Small Businesses

New products, focused on cashflow based lending, were designed specifically for Small businesses within the overall SME segment to accommodate the fact that these businesses are frequently collateral deficient and lack formal documentation.




# HBL Annual Report 2022

This model is delivering results as HBL has already disbursed more than Rs 7 billion to 2,400 customers. The Supply Chain Financing business has shown exponential growth of over 50% and is nearing PKR 10 billion. The Bank is an active participant in SBP-led initiatives for SMEs and has disbursed more than Rs 5 billion under various schemes.

HBL continued to lead the market in Agriculture financing with the landmark achievement of crossing Rs 50 billion in advances, a 27% growth over 2021. The Bank’s already dominant market share crossed 35%. SBP declared HBL as the ‘Top Agri Lending Bank’ in the Large Banks category for FY’22. The Bank was also nominated as the Champion Bank for Balochistan to lead the industry for enhancing access to agriculture credit and financial inclusion in the most under-privileged province of Pakistan. Under this initiative, HBL drove activities to create farmer awareness and worked with educational institutions to prepare students for employment opportunities. HBL was also awarded the Best Bank for Agriculture 2022 at the Pakistan Banking Awards.

In 2022, HBL made fresh disbursements of Rs 17 billion, 30% higher than in 2021, adding 3,500 customers. HBL’s focused approach on the agriculture value chain led to Rs 3 billion financing for businesses with linkages to agriculture such as processing units and cold storage facilities. The revamping of lending to the dairy and livestock sector has enabled the Bank to on-board over 1,400 farms and build a portfolio of more than Rs 3 billion. HBL also maintained leadership in Electronic Warehouse Receipt (EWR) financing by funding over Rs 700 million and achieving a market share of more than 70%. SBP named HBL as the role model financial institution for introducing and upscaling the EWR regime in the country.

HBL stood by its customers during the devastating floods, deferring repayments of more than 5,000 affected farmers while continuing fresh disbursements to enable farmers to timely sow their Rabi crops.

Considering the importance of women in the agriculture workforce, HBL launched the Nanni Kissan and Agli Nasal digital video commercials highlighting the importance of female education in the uplift of agriculture. The financial literacy and awareness of farming communities was further upscaled under the flagship “Kissan Ki Awaz” program with more than 40 sessions conducted across the country.

To bring resilience to the Agriculture sector against climatic vulnerabilities HBL, in collaboration with insurance partners, successfully completed the pilot test of the Area Yield Index Insurance product for wheat-paddy farmers. This provides insurance to farmers in case yields are impacted by climate events. To further its digitalization objectives, HBL implemented an automated Loan Origination System to digitally route loan applications. A Salesforce management application was provided to field teams, facilitating them in digitally recording customer visits and developing a sales pipeline. HBL remained the largest user of the Punjab Land Record Authority’s portal, both in Fard extractions and in online charge creation.

HBL’s unique and first-of-its-kind Farm-to-Processor initiative was implemented in the form of various pilot projects to uplift and turnaround Pakistan’s agriculture sector. HBL has been more than a lender, helping farmers improve their production through supply-side initiatives and impartial agronomical advisory. From only 5 farmers and 444 acres when HBL embarked upon this journey in 2020, the Bank has now achieved completion of 17 pilot projects, scaling up in-kind financing to 550 farmers for 26,000 acres. HBL’s fundamental shift is led by a team of 80 agronomists and field officers who guide farmers on best practices. In order to reduce time away from farm activities, HBL launched a digitally-enabled farmer onboarding system through HBL Pay. As a result of HBL’s interventions, farmers with relatively small land and lease-holdings – who represent the majority of country’s farmers – achieved an average increase of 46% in crop yield (with the highest increase being 118%) and an impressive average increase of 195% in net income (highest increase of 611%). These results have been independently validated by Princeton University development economists and demonstrate a double bottom-line impact both for the farmers and the Bank.

HBL’s Islamic Banking business is one of the fastest growing areas within the Bank, offering the entire spectrum of the Bank’s products, from large-ticket Corporate deals to retail deposits and consumer finance. In 2022, the Islamic branch network increased from 259 to 294. HBL achieved a 7% share of the market for Islamic deposits, with the total customer base crossing 1 million. In line with the Bank’s “Mobile First” strategy, HBL launched an exclusive Islamic Banking Mobile App early in 2022 with transactions through this App crossing Rs 11 billion.

An Islamic Konnect account was launched in August 2022 to cater to the unbanked and under-banked segments of society who prefer Shariah-compliant solutions. In the 5 months since launch, 200,000 current accounts have been opened, with more than 400,000 transactions valuing over Rs 2.7 billion; women make up 28% of the Islamic Konnect client base. This product also offers salary disbursement and cash collection services to corporates and microfinance institutions that prefer Shariah-compliant banking.

HBL’s Islamic Consumer business had another strong year, doubling its portfolio. Islamic Car Finance increased the number of units sold by 30%, even as the overall market shrank by 32%; receivables rose to nearly Rs 6 billion. HBL picked up the pace in the Government-led Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar scheme with a total book size of Rs 8 billion.

Total lending to Corporate and Commercial customers increased by 32%. This includes financing of the Islamic business’ unique customers as well as Islamic products offered to conventional clients. The focus on trade resulted in a growth of 11% over last year, even though the market remained depressed due to import restrictions.

HBL continues to provide market leading products to its Corporate customers, by offering solutions for working capital and term loan needs, transaction banking products and specialized products to help clients manage foreign exchange and market risks. This is achieved through a one-window solution for the wholesale banking needs of Corporate customers, while also providing their management and employees access to HBL’s suite of consumer and retail banking products.





# HBL Annual Report 2022

In a difficult year, HBL continued to lend prudently, maintaining portfolio quality through frequent reviews and achieving double digit loan growth.

HBL maintained its leadership position in cash management and continues to play an instrumental role in digitizing the financial value chain. Total cash management throughput increased by 56% to Rs 12.3 trillion in 2022. HBL Pay Business Banking, the Bank’s digital platform continued to drive volumes – for the second year running, payments through this platform doubled, to Rs 6.7 trillion with nearly 40 million transactions processed. The AsiaMoney 2022 survey ranked HBL as the Market Leader amongst domestic banks for cash management as well as the Best Services for cash management in Pakistan. What is most gratifying about these particular awards is that they were based on votes by customers, a testament to HBL’s goal of delivering innovative products tailored to client needs. HBL’s market-leading employee banking proposition provides payroll services to 3.2 million employees with deposit balances growing to Rs 252 billion. In 2022, HBL added a new feature of pay continuation insurance to provide its customers peace of mind.

In line with HBL’s vision of becoming the leading trade bank in Pakistan, a new vertical of Global Trade Services (GTS) has been created to increase focus on this business and on specialized product development to capture market share. The strategic intent is to centralize all GTS products under one umbrella, create product specialization and develop innovative structures aimed at facilitating both conventional as well as complex transaction banking needs. With import curbs affecting both importers and exporters with import dependency, HBL remained close to its clients to provide support and assist them in their Trade needs. This enhanced focus helped HBL to grow its market share to 12.9% despite an overall decline in volumes.

HBL’s Investment Banking business remains the first choice for clients and continued to support customers through advisory support and cutting-edge solutions, even in this very challenging environment. The Bank executed 20 deals valued at more than Rs 200 billion, covering the entire suite of investment banking products across a diverse array of sectors. The strategic Public Private Partnership area closed 2 road infrastructure projects. HBL also played a pivotal role in advising and closing Pakistan’s first and largest hybrid REIT issuance. 22 accolades received from various international and domestic publishers over the course of the year are a testament to the breadth and depth of HBL’s dominance of this space.

In an environment of excessive volatility, HBL’s Treasury team stepped up client engagement, providing regular economic updates and facilitating customers. The Bank’s groundbreaking digital FX portal, HBL Infinity® has received tremendous market acceptance with more than 350 clients transacting around $5.5 billion in 2022. During the year, this portal was extended to customers in the UAE and has seen a very strong reception from the client base in the region. HBL also launched Symphony®, a fixed income portal which, in another industry-first, allows institutional and corporate investors to transact digitally in the Pakistan Government Securities market, in a paperless and instantaneous manner.

HBL continues to re-engineer its Home Remittances business through improvements in service quality coupled with extensive marketing campaigns in source countries. This has led to higher volumes, which grew by 13% to $3.1 billion, and a rise in market share, to 10.6%.

HBL’s Retail digital channels – Mobile and Internet Banking, ATMs and POS – continued to play a significant role in shaping Pakistan’s financial landscape, connecting customers, businesses, and Government. In 2022, over 310 million financial transactions worth more than Rs 4.3 trillion were processed through these channels, a growth of over 55%, evidencing our commitment to becoming a Technology Company with a Banking License. Transactions through digital channels now constitute 82% of financial transactions and have contributed to significantly reducing the footfall at branches, thus containing costs and allowing for better customer focus at the branch level.

HBL Mobile and Internet Banking processed more than 125 million financial transactions worth over Rs 2.3 trillion, a doubling over 2021. This growth was driven by higher ticket sizes and a user base that has now grown to 3.2 million. HBL Mobile also processed over half a billion services transactions. The increasing confidence of customers in HBL’s digital products is reflected in the exponential growth of large ticket and C2B transactions – corporate and education fee payments rose by 221% and 93% respectively, shifting ~1.3 million corporate collection transactions away from branches.

In 2022, an HBL Islamic Mobile app was launched to provide convenience for customers with Shariah-compliant needs. HBL pioneered financial transactions through the HBL WhatsApp banking channel during 2022. WhatsApp banking now has almost 300,000 users; 54,000 transactions valued at more than Rs 150 million were processed and 2.3 million services transactions were conducted.

With over 2,200 billing partners, HBL’s Electronic Bill Presentment System (EBPS) enables customers to pay bills online. Payments rose by 65% over the previous year, reaching Rs 1.3 trillion in 2022. During the year, HBL also extended this service to the whole industry by exposing its unique billers to 1-Link, thereby enabling customers of other banks to make online payments to these organisations.

Maintaining its streak of bringing innovative solutions to Pakistan, HBL commercialized the conversion of mobile phones into POS terminals, thus enabling smartphones to accept card-based payments at the time of delivery and revolutionizing the delivery payments process. Through bypassing the need for cash on delivery, merchants get real-time information and 24-hour settlement, thus saving them the hassle of handling cash while freeing up their working capital. For this first-to-market initiative the Bank won the Best Payments Initiative award at the Pakistan Digital Awards and the Point of Sale Initiative for the Year at the Asian Retail Finance Awards.




HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

# HBL Pay Checkout

# Financial Inclusion

Financial inclusion in all its forms is a key objective of HBL. Konnect by HBL is the Bank’s main vehicle for expanding financial inclusion, offering easy access to the unbanked and under-banked segments of society across Pakistan. Konnect now has 8.3 million customers with women constituting 24% of the client base. In 2022, Konnect launched an Islamic deposit account, enabling customers to fulfil their banking needs in a Shariah-compliant way and filling a major gap in the market. With over 200,000 accounts opened since launch, Konnect Islamic Account remains unique in the industry.

Konnect offers flexible disbursement solutions to more than 840 companies and small businesses with processed volumes exceeding Rs 238 billion in 2022. Konnect collection services cater to loan repayments, school fees and distributor collections, offering round the clock banking services across Pakistan without the need to go to a branch. Total collections in 2022 more than tripled, to Rs 170 billion. Konnect by HBL has had the privilege of partnering with the Government on a variety of initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, emergency disbursements for flood relief and fuel subsidies. During the year, Konnect entered into a payment partnership with the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization for the distribution of social support payments.

# Robotic Process Automation

Early in 2021, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) was introduced with successful proof of concept deliveries and more than 50 processes converted to RPA. During 2022, the program has successfully delivered value in different cross-functional areas; since the start of the programme, 86 processes have been moved to RPA, resulting in improved processing time and saving more than 18,000 person-hours per month. This has enabled capacity increases of up to four times in these areas.

# International Operations

HBL witnessed significant improvement in its international operations in 2022, by staying relevant to network clients and upgrading technology platforms, payment systems and digital applications. Trade volumes rose by 68%, and network customer business doubled, driven by utilizing the network more effectively and enhancing beneficiary marketing. Deposits across the network remained stable with a healthy CASA mix. For multi-country clients, a structure of group level limits has been established under a Global Relationship Manager which will enable a more holistic management of key customers.

HBL’s two branches in China serve as the main engine for origination and execution of Chinese transactions, facilitating greater intra-network flows. The Bank’s successful China coverage model now covers UAE, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Maldives. In 2022, this model was expanded to East Africa in partnership with our affiliate - Diamond Trust Bank. HBL serves 54 Chinese enterprises, 19 of whom are customers in multiple locations, furthering its objective of being a bank of relevance in the region. In Pakistan, HBL remains the leading bank for China business. The China franchise is well positioned to become the flagship of the international business over the next few years.

# RMB Intermediation

HBL continued to leverage its unique position of being one of only 3 banks in MENA and South Asia to offer end-to-end RMB intermediation by extending RMB offerings to other financial institutions. HBL’s RMB Nostro proposition enables it to offer liquidity management to its Chinese clients and salary remittance services to their expatriate employees. HBL China has also established 17 new FI relationships in multiple countries to further enhance the proposition and launched an LC advising rebate program for banks in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

# Customer Service Improvements

HBL strives to provide customers with efficient and consistent service through improving self-service and digital options, front line empowerment and monitoring. Over 300 end-to-end customer journeys were simplified to improve productivity, turnaround time and customer experience. Initiatives to further reduce turn-around-times (TAT) included enhancement of Teller transaction limits and extended hours for account opening. Through the Aagahi Drive launched in 2021, over 16,000 sessions were conducted to educate front-line staff on new and revised processes, enabling them to serve customers efficiently while ensuring a robust compliance culture.

A weekly Friday Huddle was introduced to review the service experience of customers over the week and identify areas for improvement. The customer satisfaction level was 80% with problem resolution satisfaction score at 59%. During 2022, 271,433 complaints were received by the Bank, which were resolved, on average, within 5 days. The Bank’s Customer Centricity Guidelines were enhanced to include parameters for fair treatment of customers and to further inculcate a culture of service excellence through accountability, recognition, and training.

# Diversity Initiatives

In line with HBL’s diversity agenda, 35 fully accessible model branches were completed with features especially designed for differently-abled individuals, from tactile floors and talking ATMs to Braille stationery and dedicated parking. Under a Female Friendly Branch initiative, infrastructure in 350 branches was upgraded to improve hygiene and provide convenience and a sense of inclusiveness to the Bank’s female staff and customers.

# Digital Customer Experience

HBL’s Digital Customer Experience (DCE) handled 14.1 million interactions in 2022, with non-voice interactions through digital channels showing a growth of 59%. 17 new self-service features were added in 2022 and IVR-based interactions grew by 60%, to 1.6 million. HBL’s Contact Centre also received ISO 9001:2015 certification for its controls and governance.

# Sustainability Initiatives

HBL announced its commitment to meeting AKDN’s Net Zero target by 2030. Solar panels were installed at 232 premises leading to a 288 MT reduction in HBL’s carbon footprint. Other initiatives aimed at emissions reduction include HVAC and lighting rationalization in major buildings, smart fuel cards and awareness sessions to involve staff in energy conservation. All new major buildings of HBL are planned to be EDGE+ certified. In recognition of its sustainability initiatives, HBL again received an Environmental Excellence Award from the National Forum for Environment & Health.


HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 251



# HBL Annual Report 2022



In 2021, HBL took a decision to upgrade its Core Banking System from Mysis to Temenos to enable the future growth plans of the Bank. The project was formally initiated in February with the commencement of workshops for the various workstreams and preparation of Business Requirement Documents. A Testing Center of Excellence was also established to enhance Quality Assurance of software development across the bank, and implement automated testing to deliver more resilient releases and a smoother customer journey.

The HBL Brand enjoys robust health; a Brand Health Tracker study was conducted in 2022 in which HBL emerged as the strongest brand in the industry with a Brand Equity Index of 4.1, along with the highest brand awareness, usage, and consideration scores. In 2022, HBL’s flagship platform of HBLPSL was activated via the advertising campaign of “Jahan Fans, Wahan Stadium”, celebrating the spirit of the game and millions of cricket fans across the world. This was the seventh edition of HBL’s sponsorship of Pakistan’s largest and most popular sporting event. HBL’s digitally-led entertainment show attracted more than 25 million views and won the prestigious Effie Award in the Influencer Marketing category.

HBL digital marketing efforts focused on themes and platforms favoured by its clients. The Pakistan website showed an increase both in traffic as well as in session durations. Improved discoverability on search engines led to 54% of all website traffic coming through search vs 9% in 2021. HBL’s Agricultural campaign was a heart-warming made-for-digital narrative that received appreciation across social platforms. In 2022, HBL went on TikTok for the first time and continues to grow a presence for reaching younger and more varied audiences.

# Human Resources

True to being a “Bank with a Soul”, HBL undertook a number of initiatives in 2022 to provide support to staff and their families. As a market and industry first, the Bank announced the extension of its service age to 65 years. This was driven by a motivation to support employees when they reach the age of 60, but still have the energy and drive to continue at a high level of performance for some years. This also allows such employees to continue serving our customers and to mentor younger staff. This leading initiative, which was universally hailed, will benefit hundreds of families. To help employees cope with the current economic challenges, two Interim ad hoc financial assistance payments were made to middle and junior management staff. To assist employees with transport costs, interest free motorcycle loans were offered to support employees’ purchase of their own vehicles and ‘Share Sawari”, an in-house ride sharing app was launched. Rehabilitation and reconstruction financial assistance was also provided to staff impacted by the floods.

The Bank’s relentless focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion bore fruit with the Bank being recognized as the Most Inclusive Organization in Pakistan by GDEIB of the Centre for Global Inclusion. As part of this assessment, HBL won 15 awards in various categories. During the year, the Waapsi returnship program for experienced women re-entering the workforce was strengthened with a number of women hired under this program. The Bank ended the year with a diversity ratio of 21%; our goal is to increase participation by women to a quarter of the workforce by 2025. As part of our push to be even more inclusive for people with disabilities, several initiatives were undertaken, including specialized training, targeted hiring, providing grants for assistive devices and launching a specialized internship / work experience program.

Attracting and developing talent remains a cornerstone of the Bank’s strategy. To build a values-based culture and develop leadership capabilities at all levels, the Leadership Excellence program was launched in partnership with a leading global leadership development organization. Under this comprehensive program, spread over the next 3 years, over 3,000 leaders ranging from the Bank’s Executive Committee to the junior-most front-line leader will be trained and developed in line with HBL’s Leadership DNA. In 2022, this program was initiated for the Executive Committee and the General Managers of the Bank; for the remaining employees, it will be launched in 2023.

To create a strong talent pipeline, while also helping to upgrade the capabilities of the country’s educational institutions, collaborations were formalized with 15 universities throughout Pakistan to provide customized support to students, faculty and curriculum depending on institutional needs and HBL’s objectives. This program will assist students with scholarships and internships; provide faculty with research opportunities and real-life business projects; and provide universities with assistance on curriculum development to prepare students with skills required in today’s workplaces.

HBL continues its journey of cultural transformation to have engaged, digitally savvy and customer-centric staff to deliver its strategy. The Bank’s management trainee and graduate trainee programs, The League remain amongst the most sought-after in the industry and help to build a high-potential talent bench strength. Additionally, entry-level batch hiring for certain targeted roles helped to add capacity. As part of capability building, over 500,000 person-hours of training were delivered to keep employees’ skills updated in line with global best practices and market needs. In pursuit of the Bank’s customer-centricity goals, customer service and compliance training were at the top of the agenda. As part of the drive to continue embedding HBL’s Values in the organization, 2022 annual performance assessments for all employees also included a formal evaluation of how well they demonstrated the expected behaviours.

# Risk Management Framework

HBL’s strategy is underpinned by the proactive management of risk. HBL fosters a strong risk culture through a comprehensive management of risks, applicable to all levels of the organization with close Board oversight, multi-tier management supervision, efficient systems and clearly articulated policies and procedures. As part of the governance structure, the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) monitors, assesses and manages the risk profile of the Bank on an ongoing basis. At senior management level, various risk committees are responsible for oversight and execution, while day-to-day risk management activities are delegated to different levels.


252 HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022



HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

As the economy came under pressure during the year, time-tested credit management practices, including regular Early Alert Committee meetings and stress testing, helped to ensure the strength and resilience of the Bank’s credit portfolio. There was a continued focus on enhancing portfolio monitoring and implementing tools for early identification of risks, particularly within the SME, Agriculture and Consumer lending portfolios. New credit scorecards were developed for Consumer and Agriculture and refresher training was provided to credit teams across the country. Risk management systems continued to evolve to facilitate business growth whilst limiting the effect of any residual risks.

To further develop bench strength and provide structured risk management training, HBL has introduced a comprehensive modular training program. The objective is to develop a uniform credit risk assessment mindset that is focused on forward-looking risk drivers, and hence adopt a proactive, rather than a reactive approach based on historical data. The program has been developed in-house and is being delivered by the Bank’s senior resources.

Market and liquidity risk indicators are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Market & Liquidity Risk Committee and by ALCO. A comprehensive structure is in place to ensure that the Bank remains within its tolerance for market risk. Policies and procedures are in place to govern operational risk management in a systematic and consistent manner. Key tools such as Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Key Risk Indicators and Operational Loss Data Management are used to gauge the likelihood and severity of operational risk incidents. The Bank’s operational risk profile and fraud risk assessment are regularly shared with senior management and the BRMC.

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function was a key area of management focus and continued to be strengthened during the year. ERM is applicable to all functions, which ensures a robust and consistent approach to risk management at all levels of the organization. The Bank’s ERM Framework, approved by the Board, outlines the high-level risk management principles and sets out the governance structure, standards, objectives and key responsibilities of different functions.

During 2022 the ERM team created a Bank-wide Integrated Risk and Control Repository (IRCR). The objective of this repository is to identify, manage, monitor and mitigate all risks and issues in a holistic way across the entire organization. As part of the implementation of the IRCR, self-testing by the first line of defence is being embedded across the organization. The ERM function also includes a Model Risk Management arm that aims to provide an independent review and validation of all models being used in the Bank.

The Compliance function’s role is to strengthen the compliance environment and manage compliance risk across the institution by enabling the Bank to comply with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and the Bank’s internal policies and procedures, including financial crime compliance (FCC) management. HBL places reliance on Compliance Risk Management (CRM) as a prudent mitigation strategy. Global Compliance, as an independent function, assists senior management in designing, implementing, and enabling the CRM framework in all relevant jurisdictions in liaison with businesses. The objective of this framework is to proactively manage regulatory instructions, requirements and expectations as well as to identify emerging compliance and financial crime risks. HBL’s CRM strategy dovetails with the Bank’s strategy and incorporates industry trends, evolving regulatory requirements and global best practices.

Compliance, in liaison with business, identifies, assesses, monitors, and reports compliance risk through regulatory themed RCSAs. A comprehensive process of regulatory risk repository management has been implemented for ensuring adequate design and effectiveness of controls around regulatory requirements. During 2022, a weekly Regulatory Pulse was introduced as an information and monitoring tool for regulatory risk management and readiness assessment. Accordingly, enhancements were made to certain policies and procedures to create a more appropriate and enabling compliance framework.

The current volatile economic environment and the evolving geopolitical and regional situation have resulted in new emerging regulatory and FCC risks. Accordingly, Compliance instituted continuous engagement with internal customers through a series of Compliance On the Go roadshows across all regions. This was in addition to the rigorous specialized engagement sessions and trainings conducted bank-wide. In order to benchmark with global best practices, a validation and optimization project has been initiated for enhancing the effectiveness of existing transaction monitoring and sanctions screening systems.

Global Compliance has recently realigned its organizational structure by enhancing compliance monitoring, digital enablement and innovation in order to seamlessly connect with the businesses whilst enabling the necessary touchpoints with regulators. The Ethics & Conduct function has also now been integrated within the Compliance function.

The Compliance Committee of Management, chaired by the President, monitors and reviews compliance and conduct related matters. The Board Compliance & Conduct Committee (BCNCC) supports the Board in overseeing the implementation of a compliance and conduct culture and provides governance over the implementation of a bank-wide compliance program. HBL’s whistleblowing program is directed at safeguarding the Bank’s integrity and reputation and aims to increase employee ownership in reporting suspected cases of fraud, corruption, harassment and other infringements of the Bank’s Code of Conduct. The BCNCC also oversees ethics and conduct related matters including whistle-blowing; any related investigations are overseen by the Board Audit Committee (BAC) and disciplinary actions are reviewed by the Board Human Resource & Remuneration Committee. During the year, further efforts were made to spread awareness of the various communication channels available for employee speak-up.

# It is vitally important for HBL to protect its customers and their data from cyberattacks and data breaches.

The Bank’s Information Security function plays a pivotal role in protecting HBL’s data assets from both internal and external threats through the effective management of cybersecurity risk, supported by preventive and detective controls capable of responding to emerging external threats. The Bank’s 24x7 Security Operations Centre continues to contribute to a robust security posture through various monitoring, detection, and preventive mechanisms.

Robust authentication and behavioral analytics of customers transacting over digital channels are essential controls in the prevention of cyber-frauds. A focused effort has helped the Bank to reduce the quantum of such incidents. The Bank also successfully completed the annual requirement of demonstrating compliance to the SWIFT Customer Security Program as well as ISO 27001 compliance. An extensive internal awareness campaign was launched to provide training and guidance on information security related matters and was supplemented by targeted awareness campaigns for customers. The Bank is committed to strengthening cyber-defenses through the use of automation and modern technologies, including AI and machine learning, while proactively mitigating against advanced security threats. These security measures allow HBL to continue offering innovative digital solutions to its clients while ensuring them protection and peace of mind.

# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

HBL makes a concerted effort to operate in ways that enhance the well-being of society, and that emphasize compassion and sharing, a spirit that we inculcate in our employees as a socially responsible organization. Contributing to the communities in which we operate is one of the pillars of our strategic agenda. The majority of HBL’s giving is done through the HBL Foundation (HBLF), under strict evaluation criteria to maintain transparency, quality and legitimacy, and to monitor and measure the impact and sustainability of each grant. The Foundation seeks out organizations that help underserved and underprivileged communities to navigate a future where at least basic individual needs are met. HBLF completed a decade of giving in 2021; in 2022, its philanthropic funding was increased to 1.5% of the Bank’s profit after tax.

In 2022, HBL directly contributed Rs 133 million, the bulk of which was on flood rehabilitation efforts in Sindh and Balochistan. In its immediate response the Bank, in partnership with Jubilee Life Insurance and Jubilee General Insurance, distributed relief supplies worth Rs 180 million to over 10 communities across both provinces. These included 15,000 ration bags providing up to 8 million meals, 4,000 mosquito nets, and 3,100 family-sized water-proof tents. The floods accentuated the problem of access to safe drinking water for which HBLF provided Rs 10 million for the distribution of 2,500 water filtration kits. HBL partnered with the Government of Pakistan and the National Disaster Management Authority, to disburse emergency relief funds under the BISP umbrella to 1 million flood affectees. HBL and its staff went above and beyond in the face of this humanitarian crisis, defying challenges of mobility and approachability to ensure that the impacted population was helped in any way possible. HBL also contributed Rs 128 million to build 100 prefabricated houses in each of two villages in the Larkana area.

In 2022, HBL Foundation donated Rs 349 million to 31 organizations operating in the areas of healthcare, education, community development, arts and culture across Pakistan. Rs 252 million were contributed to the healthcare sector for lifesaving medical equipment, tertiary healthcare for children, and eye and surgical camps. Amongst others, support was provided to the Sundas Foundation’s whose Iron Chelation Therapy program will benefit 200 Thalassemia patients a year, a mobile hospital that benefits 500 people per week in the remotest areas of Punjab, and a pediatric center in PIMS Islamabad for preventive, emergency, and primary childcare.

The Foundation donated Rs 76 million for the provision of education, technical and vocational programs to students across Pakistan. In 2022, HBLF also launched Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) scholarships for girls from underserved communities. 5 scholarships each were given to the National University of Sciences and Technology and to the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

HBL Foundation also supports interventions related to art, music and culture. All Pakistan Music Conference, a Karachi-based not-for-profit, was provided a grant for an archiving project called Living Masters that aims to document the art, journey, and relationships of legendary musicians in Pakistan through interviews and masterclasses.

To ensure the inclusion of a diverse set of communities, Rs 5.5 million were granted for procurement and distribution of rations to 1,000 Christian, Hindu, Fisherfolk, and Transgender families. These disbursements were carried out with the support of the Gender Interactive Alliance and Tehrik-e-Niswan and provided these families sufficient food for a month. HBL encourages a strong spirit of volunteerism amongst its employees through a well-coordinated program that regularly identifies opportunities to serve. During the year, our staff stepped up to support a diverse range of activities including tree plantation, clean-up drives, blood camps and donating books and toys to the less fortunate.

# Credit Ratings

In June 2022, the Bank’s credit ratings were re-affirmed by VIS Credit Rating Company Limited at AAA/A-1+ for long-term and short-term respectively. The rating of the TFCs issued as Additional Tier 1 Capital in September 2019 has also been re-affirmed as AA+. The recently issued Additional Tier 1 Capital TFCs have been rated as AA+. The Outlook on all ratings is Stable. The ratings incorporate HBL’s position as the largest commercial bank in the country and reflect its strong financial and liquidity profile and systemic importance. VIS also pointed out that HBL’s strategy of enhancing its digital footprint remains a competitive advantage for the Bank. In October, Moody’s downgraded the sovereign rating from B3 to Caa1, with a Negative Outlook. It subsequently mirrored this action for the large Pakistan banks, including HBL.



Future Outlook
At the start of 2023, Pakistan faces perhaps the most challenging economic conditions in its history. While the country has faced serious crises in previous eras, the current situation is complicated by the sheer magnitude of the fiscal and monetary challenges. Structural shortcomings that have built up over several decades have finally come home to roost, resulting in an import-dependent economy which has continued to pile pressure on the external account and resulted in downgrades of Pakistan’s sovereign ratings.

The impact of these factors has been compounded by the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The combination of these two events have led to an upheaval in global supply chains and the concomitant rise of high and persistent inflationary pressures across the globe; a large-scale reduction in risk appetite on frontier markets such as Pakistan; and a realignment of geopolitical preferences. The low level of foreign exchange reserves has led to a de-facto rationing, resulting in supply bottlenecks across the economy, now even affecting exports. Companies are responding by cutting production and announcing layoffs, which will further depress demand and affect lives and livelihoods, all against a backdrop of entrenched inflation at levels not seen for nearly half a century.

It is quite clear that the only pathway out of this situation is to rapidly conclude the 9th review of the EFF and seek a continuation of the IMF programme. A Staff Level Agreement with the Fund is now an existential necessity, and must be pursued with single-minded urgency. The government has belatedly agreed to many of the major conditionalities required by the Fund, including concessions on revenues (mostly indirect), and a reversion to a floating exchange rate regime. A resolution is likely to be accompanied by difficult social and political conditions, although we should see a gradual return of investor appetite, leading to a near-normalization of conditions over the next 12 – 18 months. Policymakers must now tread a sensible path towards meaningful structural reform and a way out of the current predicament.

HBL has successfully navigated the plethora of headwinds it has faced during the year. Successive record quarters have led to another record year with leadership positions further entrenched across most areas of our operations; results from the strong domestic franchise have been boosted by the international business also now delivering operating profitability.

For the second year in a row, our achievements were recognised through our winning Pakistan’s most prestigious award, The Best Bank in Pakistan, at the IBP Banking Awards. Our Transaction Banking business has won a number of awards; the fact that these are based on client feedback makes them even more meaningful. We dedicate these results to our customers, many of whom have banked with us across generations and who are at the heart of all we do.

HBL’s investments in technology over many years are coming to fruition; the more virtual way of life, originally forced upon the world by the pandemic, is now seen by customers as a means of accessibility and convenience. Increasing digitalization of our businesses has become a way of life for HBL, whether it be paperless consumer financing, remote digital account opening or gamified hiring and training. This year, we have again introduced a slew of innovative products that have revolutionized the digital banking space: WhatsApp banking, Tokenization, Mobile POS enablement and Pakistan’s first Islamic branchless banking proposition. From HBL Mobile to Konnect, e-commerce to QR payments, HBL continues to set benchmarks in customer uptake and usage, embedding its position as a technology company with a banking license – one that is shaping the digital landscape in the country.

HBL is an integral part of the nation’s fabric – as Pakistan’s premier financial institution, HBL keeps stepping up in every sphere to support the country. We remain obsessed with providing thought leadership across the full spectrum of the economy, working with the Government under a public-private partnership model. Our pioneering interventions in agriculture have had a dramatic impact on the lives of farmers and going forward we will scale this up even more rapidly.

Our role in helping Pakistan exit the FATF grey list has been publicly acknowledged and lauded and we remain the go-to organisation in the country for disaster relief. In 2022, we extended our founding support to HBLPSL to a full decade – an event that has helped put Pakistan back on the map of world cricket and brought untold joy to tens of millions of Pakistanis. HBL continues to patronise the arts and artists, bring art into the public space and providing people from all walks of life opportunities to enjoy and appreciate art.

HBL continues to take bold initiatives to tackle the world’s most important issue – climate change – by continually raising the bar, even at the cost of foregoing business.

| 1      | Provision against advances | Refer notes 4.4 and 9.5 to the unconsolidated financial statements for accounting policy and particulars of provision against advances. The Bank’s advances to customers represent 37% of its total assets. These are stated net of provision against advances of Rs. 86.81 billion as at December 31, 2022. The provision against advances was identified as a key focus area in our audit as it involves a considerable degree of management judgment and estimation uncertainty along with compliance with the regulatory requirements. Our audit procedures for domestic advances included:- Assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of manual and automated controls over classification and grading of customers, including:

* The accuracy of data input into the system used for credit grading;
* The ongoing monitoring and identification of advances displaying indicators of impairment and whether they are migrating on a timely basis to early alert or to higher risk grade;
* Identification of past due customers.

- For a sample of advances, where the management has not identified as displaying indicators of impairment, challenged the management’s assessment by comparing the historical performance, financial ratios and reports on security maintained and formed our own view whether any impairment indicators are present.

- Where management has identified as displaying indicators of impairment, assessed the number of days overdue and factors used for calculation of provision in accordance with the Prudential Regulations.

- For consumer advances, analysed the days past due report and factors used for calculation of specific provision required in accordance with Prudential Regulations.

- For consumer advances, where the management has not identified as displaying any indicators of impairment, compared the general provision calculated with provision required in accordance with Prudential Regulations.We issued instructions to the auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Impairment of loans and advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those overseas branches performed audit procedures to respond to the significant risk and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Bank, also evaluated the work performed by the component auditors through their files review and discussions with them. |

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.


280 HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022


HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 281


HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Amyn Pirani.

288 HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022



# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

The SBP, vide its BSD Circular Letter no. 10 dated August 26, 2002, has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and International Accounting Standard 40, Investment Property, for banking companies till further instructions. Further, the SECP, through S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008, has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the SBP through various circulars.

The SECP has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, ‘Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits’ with effect from January 1, 2014. The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions.

IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, was notified by the SECP as applicable for accounting periods beginning from January 1, 2015. However, the SECP, through SRO 56(I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, has directed that the requirement of consolidation under this standard and under Section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017, is not applicable in the case of investments by a bank in mutual funds managed by its own asset management company and established under the trust structure. Therefore, investments by the Bank in mutual funds managed by HBL AMC are not consolidated as would otherwise be required under the definition of control specified in IFRS 10.

These unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared using generally consistent accounting policies. However, Overseas branches comply with the local regulations enforced within their respective jurisdictions.

# 2.3 Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. These are considered either to not be relevant or to not have any significant impact on these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.4 Standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The Bank has elected for the modified retrospective approach for restatement. Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 2.4.1, the Bank expects that adoption of new standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 2.4.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of the application of IFRS 9, taking into account the SBP’s application instructions. The assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to change at the time of recognizing the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9. In addition, there will be changes in the classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework under which the Board Audit Committee (BAC) is tasked with overseeing the implementation of IFRS 9. A Steering Committee for the implementation of IFRS 9, chaired by the CFO, is in place including representation from Risk, all front-line businesses, Operations and IT.

Risk Management has developed models / methodologies for calculating the Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Credit Conversion Factors (CCF) for off-balance sheet exposures. These models shall be validated annually including:

- Expected credit loss (ECL) model design, data quality and benchmarking with external best practices.
- Calibration testing which ensures the accuracy of the observed PDs.

Finance identifies, prepares and extracts the data required for the modelling of risk parameters and the ECL calculations. The Bank has also implemented an automated system for the calculation of ECL as prescribed under IFRS 9 guidelines issued by the SBP.

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity’s business model. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank has reviewed the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 289

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# Equity Securities

Listed equity securities currently classified as held-for-trading will be classified as FVTPL. For certain listed equity securities currently classified as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to classify them as FVOCI. Therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have an impact on initial adoption. However, in accordance with the requirements of the standard, gains and losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

The remaining listed equity securities will be measured at FVTPL. The AFS reserve related to those securities is currently part of Surplus on Revaluation of Assets and will be reclassified to retained earnings hence, there will be no impact on overall equity.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. However, the SBP has allowed banks to carry these investments under the current Prudential Regulations, i.e. at the lower of cost and break-up value, till accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Certain debt securities currently classified as AFS and that pass the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at FVOCI as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows and also to sell those investments. The remaining debt securities that pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cashflows.

Debt securities currently classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and that pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized cost.

Debt securities currently classified as HFT and certain debt instruments currently classified as AFS and which are not expected to pass the SPPI test, will be measured at FVTPL.

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses resulting from potential default events.

Based on the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

For the purpose of ECL calculation, the Bank has used 5 years’ data till December 31, 2022. Going forward, data for one additional year shall be included until the Bank has at least 10-year data. For calculating ECL, the Bank shall classify its financial assets under the following three categories:

- Stage 1: Performing Assets: For financial assets where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since initial recognition, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
- Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: For financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but which are not credit impaired, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on lifetime ECL.
- Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: For financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date, the Bank shall recognize ECL using the higher of the lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 and the provision required as per the Prudential Regulations.

290 HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

Under the SBP’s instructions, Government Securities and credit exposure in local currency guaranteed by the Government are exempted from the application of the ECL framework.

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or interest payments are past due:

- by 365 days or more for agriculture lending
- by 60 days or more for all other segments

Qualitative factors include, inter alia, unavailability of financial information and pending litigation.

At every reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset, in which case, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (Stage 2 or 3).

# Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation which will be incorporated as per the SBP’s revised format.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 9. This is an estimate and the actual impact on the Bank’s financial statements for the year 2023 will depend on the financial instruments that the Bank holds during that period and the economic conditions at that time, as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future.

# Classification and measurement

The classification of the Banks investments is expected to change as follows:

- Debt instruments amounting to Rs 228.910 billion will be reclassified from AFS to Amortised Cost.
- Equity securities amounting to Rs 1.784 billion will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL.

# Financial impact

The total estimated impact (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity as at January 1, 2023 is an increase of approximately Rs 6.072 billion, representing:

- A decrease of Rs 8.265 billion in equity due to an increase in ECL.
- An increase of Rs 14.337 billion in equity resulting from reclassification of investments as mentioned above.

# Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL on capital, the SBP has permitted banks to adopt a transitional approach to phase in the impact over a period of five years. The transitional arrangement applies only to ECL for stage 1 and 2 financial assets.

# Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's financial statements or where judgement was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

During the year, the Bank has reviewed its estimate of the useful life of Point of Sale (POS) terminals in its domestic operations and the useful life of intangibles in its China branches, which has resulted in a change in the Bank's estimate of their useful lives. These revisions have been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate as per the requirements of IAS 8 and accordingly, have been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated profit and loss account from the current year.

The impact of these changes is disclosed in note 10.2.1 and 11.3 respectively.

# 3 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

In the case of investments classified as held-for-trading, transaction costs are expensed through the profit and loss account. Transaction costs associated with investments other than those classified as held-for-trading are included in the cost of the investments.

# 4.3.2 Subsequent measurement

# Held-for-trading

Investments classified as held-for-trading are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is taken to the profit and loss account.

# Held-to-maturity

Investments classified as held-to-maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

# Available-for-sale

Listed securities classified as available-for-sale are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation is recorded in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account (shown as part of equity in the statement of financial position) and is taken to the profit and loss account either when realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired.

NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

Unlisted equity securities are carried at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per its latest available audited financial statements. The Bank may also use unaudited or management accounts to determine if any additional impairment needs to be charged beyond amounts already charged based on audited financial statements. Other unlisted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

# 4.3.3 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures

Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are recorded at cost less impairment, if any.

# 4.3.4 Impairment

The Bank determines that available-for-sale listed equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of these investments below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Bank evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there is evidence of deterioration in the financial condition of the investee, industry and sector performance and changes in technology. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal. A decline in the carrying value of unlisted equity securities is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision for diminution in the value of debt securities held in Pakistan is made as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. Provision against investments by the Bank's overseas branches is made as per the requirements of their respective regulatory regimes.

When a debt security, classified as available-for-sale, is considered to be impaired, the balance in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account is transferred to the profit and loss account as an impairment charge. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed through the profit and loss account.

When a debt security, classified as held-to-maturity, is considered to be impaired, the impairment is directly charged to the profit and loss account as held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the debt security, is credited to the profit and loss account.

Provision for diminution in the value of other securities is made after considering objective evidence of impairment. The Bank considers that a decline in the recoverable value of its investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures below their carrying value may be evidence of impairment. Recoverable value is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value falls below the carrying value and is charged to the profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the carrying value of the investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.4 Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Provision against advances by the Bank's operations in Pakistan is made in accordance with the requirements of the Prudential Regulations. Provision against advances by the Bank's overseas branches is made as per the requirements of the respective regulatory regimes. Advances are written off in line with the Bank’s policy when there are no realistic prospects of recovery.

Since 2020, several borrowers have been severely impacted, initially by the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, by the stressed economic conditions. The potential impact of the economic stress is difficult to predict, as many such borrowers have also availed the SBP enabled deferment / restructuring & rescheduling relief. Hence, management feels that it is appropriate to maintain an additional general provision on the domestic, funded performing credit portfolio excluding:

- Government guaranteed exposure
- Consumer and staff lending
- Exposure secured by cash / near cash collateral

This additional provision as at any statement of financial position date, is based on management’s best estimate and can be up to and maximum of 1% of above mentioned portfolio. And on account of the devastating floods in 2022 which have impacted customers in its area of operations.

# 4.4.1 Finance lease receivables

Leases where the Bank transfers a substantial portion of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the future lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. The net investment in finance lease is included in advances.

# 4.4.2 Islamic financing and related assets

Murabaha financing is a cost plus profit transaction. Funds disbursed for the purchase of goods are recorded as an advance against Murabaha. Once the goods are sold to the customers, the transaction is recorded as financing. Goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold are recorded as inventories.

The financing is recorded at the deferred sale price. Profit earned on financing is recognised as unearned income and amortised into the profit and loss account over the term of the Murabaha financing. It is possible for Bank to buy the inventory on a customer's behalf and sell it to the customers on spot basis. In this case, the entire profit is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

Under Ijarah financing, the Bank transfers the rights to use an asset to the customer for an agreed period for an agreed consideration. Assets given under Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, residual value and impairment losses, if any. The depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the term of the Ijarah after taking into account the estimated residual value. Impairment of Ijarah assets is recognised in line with the Prudential Regulations or upon the occurrence of an impairment event which indicates that the carrying value of the Ijarah asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The Ijarah rental received / receivable is recognised as income on an accrual basis.

Gains or losses on disposal of Ijarah assets are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.

For Running Musharakah the Bank and the customer enter a Musharakah (transaction or business partnership arrangement) where the Bank agrees to finance the operating activities of the customer's business and share the profit or loss at a pre-agreed ratio. Profit is provisionally recognised on an accrual basis and is adjusted once the customer declares the final profit after issuance of audited financial statements.

Under Diminishing Musharakah financing, the Bank and the customer create joint beneficial ownerships over tangible assets to fulfill the customer's capital expenditure / project requirements. The Bank receives periodic payments, partly for renting its portion of the assets to the customer and partly for the gradual transfer / sale of its share of ownership to the customer. The rental payment is recognised as profit while the asset transfer / sale payments are applied towards reducing the outstanding principal.

Under Istisna financing, the Bank gives an advance to customers for manufacturing goods and may allow their sale immediately after the goods are manufactured or allow a pre-agreed time to sell the goods on deferred payment basis as the Bank's agent to a third party. Profit is recognised at the time when the goods are sold to the third party. In case of a deferred sale, the profit is recognised on an accrual basis over the term of financing.

Under Tijarah financing, the Bank purchases finished goods from the customer against payment, takes possession and appoints the customer as an agent to sell these goods to the ultimate buyer, generally on a deferred payment basis. Goods purchased by the Bank and sold by the customer on a deferred payment basis are recognised as financing while goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold by the customer are recorded as inventories. Profit on the financing is recognised on an accrual basis over the period of transaction.

Wakalah is an agency contract in which the Bank provides funds to a customer to invest in a Shariah compliant manner. This is recorded as financing and profit is recognised on an accrual basis and is adjusted once the customer declares Wakalah business performance.

Salam is a sale whereby the Bank undertakes to supply some specific commodity (ies) / asset(s) to the customer at a future date in exchange for an advance price fully paid on spot.

Currency Salam is exchange / sale of a currency with another currency at a future date, at conversion rate within the spot range on the day of such contract execution.

Under Musawamah financing, the Bank purchases the goods and, after taking possession, sells them to the customer at an agreed price without disclosing the cost incurred by the Bank. Goods purchased by the Bank can either be sold to the customer as a spot transaction or on a deferred payment basis. Goods purchased by the Bank but remaining unsold are recorded as inventories.

# 4.5 Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amounts, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Land, capital work-in-progress and works of art are not depreciated. Other items included in fixed assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation is calculated to write down the assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Depreciation on additions is charged from the month in which the assets are available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognised in the profit and loss account, such increase is also recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets account. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against any additional surplus on revaluation and the net carrying value is restated at the revalued amount of the asset.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) is transferred to unappropriated profit to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred. Major repairs and renovations that increase the useful life of an asset are capitalised. Gains or losses arising on the disposal of fixed assets are included in the profit and loss account. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of fixed assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.6 Right-of-use assets and their related lease liability

# 4.6.1 Right-of-use assets

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets (ROU) are measured at an amount equal to the initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located to its original condition. ROU assets are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation / accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability. Such remeasurement only occurs in cases where the terms of the lease are changed during the lease tenor.

ROU assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over a period starting from the commencement date of the lease contract to the end of the estimated useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier. The estimated useful lives of ROU assets are determined on the same basis as that for owned assets. Depreciation on additions (new leases) is charged from the month in which the leases are entered into. No depreciation is charged in the month in which the leases mature or are terminated.

# 4.6.2 Lease liability against ROU assets

Lease liabilities against ROU assets are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, then at the applicable incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and a finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit and loss account as markup expense over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 4.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Amortisation is calculated to write down the assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives at the rates stated in note 11.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements. Amortisation on additions is charged from the month in which the assets are available for use. No amortisation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off. The residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Intangible assets which arise from contractual or other legal rights on the acquisition of another entity and are deemed separable are considered as part of the net identifiable assets acquired. These are initially measured at fair value. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their expected useful lives and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are stated at cost less impairment, if any. Such intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, as per the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. An impairment charge in respect of intangible assets is recognised through the profit and loss account. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the extent of the impairment, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.8 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recorded at cost and are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued with sufficient regularity by professionally qualified valuers to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase in the market value over the acquisition cost is recorded as a surplus on revaluation. A decline in the market value is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment. A subsequent increase in the market value of an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the impairment and thereafter credited to the surplus on revaluation of that asset. All direct costs of acquiring title to the asset are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.

Depreciation on assets acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on the Bank's owned fixed assets. If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately. These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realized on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realized on the sale of fixed assets. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realized on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit. However, if such an asset, subsequent to initial recording, is used by the Bank for its own operations, the asset, along with any related surplus, is transferred to fixed assets.

# 4.9 Borrowings / deposits

Borrowings / deposits are recorded at the amount of proceeds received. The cost of borrowings / deposits is recognised as an expense on an accrual basis in the period in which it is incurred.

# 4.10 Subordinated debt

Subordinated debt is recorded at the amount of proceeds received. Mark-up accrued on subordinated debt is charged to the profit and loss account.

# 4.11 Acceptances

Acceptances comprise undertakings by the Bank to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. Acceptances are recognised as a financial liability in the statement of financial position with the contractual right of reimbursement from the customer recognised as a financial asset.

# 4.12 Employee benefits

The Bank operates a number of post-retirement benefit plans, which include both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.

For defined contribution plans, the Bank pays contributions to the fund on a periodic basis, and such amounts are charged to the profit and loss account when the payment obligation is established. The Bank has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

For funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets as at the statement of financial position date. Contributions to the fund are made by the Bank on a periodic basis.

For non-funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligations as at the statement of financial position date.

The liability in respect of all obligations under defined benefit schemes is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses that arise out of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on remeasurement of the liability for compensated absences are recognised in the profit and loss account.

# Past Service Cost

Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment and is recognised through the profit and loss account when the plan is amended.

# Current Service Cost

Current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period, and is recognised through the profit and loss account.

# 4.13 Foreign currency

# 4.13.1 Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into rupees at the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into rupees at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the statement of financial position. Forward transactions in foreign currencies and foreign bills purchased are translated at forward foreign exchange rates applicable to their respective maturities.

# 4.13.2 Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Pakistani rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the statement of financial position. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Pakistani Rupees at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

# 4.13.3 Translation gains and losses

Gains and losses arising from foreign currency translations are taken to the profit and loss account, except those arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign branches, associates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, which are recognized through the statement of other comprehensive income as an Exchange Translation Reserve (ETR). Balances in the ETR are only taken to the profit and loss account on disposal of the investment.

# 4.13.4 Contingencies and Commitments

Commitments for outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts are disclosed in the financial statements at contracted rates.

# 4.14 Income recognition

Revenue is recognised to the extent that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured.

# 4.14.1 Advances and investments

Income on performing advances and debt securities is recognised on a time proportion basis as per the terms of the contract. Where debt securities are purchased at a premium or discount, such premium / discount is amortised through the profit and loss account over the remaining maturity of the debt security using the effective yield method. Income recoverable on classified advances and investments is recognised on a receipt basis. Income on rescheduled / restructured advances and investments is recognised as permitted by SBP regulations or by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the Bank operates.

# 4.14.2 Lease financing

Income from lease financing is accounted for using the financing method. Under this method, the unearned lease income (defined as the sum of total lease rentals and estimated residual value less the cost of the leased assets) is taken to income over the term of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net investment in the lease. Gains and losses on termination of lease contracts are recognised through the profit and loss account when these are realised. For classified leases, unrealised lease income and other fees are recognised on a receipt basis.

# 4.14.3 Fee, Commission and Brokerage Income

Fee, commission and brokerage income is recognised on an accrual basis.

# 4.14.4 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the dividend is established.

# 4.15 Taxation

Income tax expense comprises of the charge for current and prior years and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

# 4.15.1 Current

The charge for current taxation is calculated on taxable income earned during the year from local as well as foreign operations using tax rates enacted as at the date of the statement of financial position.

# 4.15.2 Prior years

The charge for prior years represents adjustments to the tax charge for prior years, arising from assessments, changes in estimates, and retrospectively applied changes to law, made during the current year.

# 4.15.3 Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deductible temporary differences (deferred tax assets) are temporary differences that are deductible from the taxable income of future periods when the carrying amount of the underlying asset or liability is recovered or settled. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. Taxable temporary differences (deferred tax liabilities) are temporary differences that will result in a tax liability in future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to be applicable to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the date of the statement of financial position. The Bank also records a deferred tax asset / liability on items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income such as surplus / deficit on revaluation of assets and actuarial gains / losses. These items are disclosed net of the related deferred tax asset / liability. Deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for impairment. Where objective evidence exists that the carrying value of a deferred tax asset may not be recoverable, the deferred tax asset is reduced to its recoverable value. The difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value is recognised through the profit and loss account as a deferred tax expense.

# 4.16 Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying value of non-financial assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised through the profit and loss account whenever the recoverable value of an asset is lower than its carrying value.

A subsequent increase in the recoverable value of the asset results in a reversal of the impairment loss through the profit and loss account, up to the original carrying value of the asset, if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.

# 4.17 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

A provision for off balance sheet obligations is recognised when the Bank becomes aware of the obligation and reasonable certainty exists that the Bank will settle the obligation. The charge to the profit and loss account is stated net of expected recoveries and the obligation is recognised in other liabilities.

Provisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 4.18 Contingent Liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position as they are possible obligations where it has yet to be confirmed whether a liability, which will ultimately result in an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation, will arise. In cases where the probability of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote, it is not disclosed as a contingent liability.

# 4.19 Off setting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are set-off and the net amount is reported in the unconsolidated financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off and the Bank intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously.

# 4.20 Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities carried on the statement of financial position include cash and bank balances, lending to financial institutions, investments, advances, certain other receivables, bills payable, borrowings, deposits, subordinated debt, lease liabilities against ROU assets and certain payables. The particular recognition methods adopted for significant financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the relevant policy notes.

# 4.21 Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at their fair values using appropriate valuation techniques. Derivative financial instruments are carried as an asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair value is negative. Any change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is taken directly to the profit and loss account.

# 4.22 Dividends and appropriation to reserves

Dividends and appropriations to reserves, which are approved subsequent to the date of the statement of financial position are except where required by law recognised in the year in which these are approved and disclosed as a non-adjusting event after the balance sheet date.

# 4.23 Earnings per share

The Bank presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the year attributable to equity holders of the Bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is not calculated separately, as the Bank does not have any convertible instruments in issue.

# 22 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

A derivative is a financial instrument whose value changes in response to changes in a specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index or a similar variable, sometimes called the underlying. Derivatives include forwards, futures, swaps, options and structured financial products that have one or more of the characteristics of forwards, futures, swaps and options.

The Bank, as an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD), is an active participant in the Pakistan derivatives market. The ADD license covers only transactions permitted under the Financial Derivatives Business Regulations issued by the SBP, which are:

- (a) Foreign Currency Options
- (b) Forward Rate Agreements
- (c) Interest Rate Swaps
- (d) Cross Currency Swaps

However, the Bank also offers other derivative products to satisfy customer requirements, specific approval of which is sought from the SBP on a transaction by transaction basis.

These transactions cover the aspects of both market making and hedging. The risk management processes and policies related to derivatives are disclosed in note 44.5 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 36 DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER BENEFITS

# 36.1 General Information

The Bank operates the following schemes:

# 36.1.1 Pension Fund (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates an approved funded pension scheme which is applicable to:

- All clerical employees who opted for this scheme when it was introduced in 1974 and those who joined after this date.
- Executives and officers who opted for this scheme when it was introduced with effect from May 1, 1977 and those who joined the Bank during the period from May 1, 1977 till December 31, 2001.

For clerical employees, the benefit is based on their actual years of service as of the statement of financial position date and their last drawn salary. For executives and officers, the benefit is based on their basic salary as at March 31, 2014 and their years of service up to March 31, 2005. For service subsequent to this date (i.e. from April 1, 2005), they are entitled to the Bank's contributory provident fund (refer note 37.1) and the Bank's contributory gratuity fund (refer note 37.2). Eligible employees are entitled to a minimum pension as per applicable rules.

# 36.1.2 Benevolent Fund (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates an approved funded benevolent fund scheme for all employees who joined on or before December 31, 2018 and who retire from or expire during service. Under this scheme, a fixed monthly subscription is made by employees by way of a salary deduction and a matching monthly contribution is made by the Bank. All eligible employees are entitled to receive a fixed monthly amount or a one-time lump sum payment in lieu of a fixed monthly amount, as per the rules of the Fund. Clerical employees are additionally entitled to marriage and funeral grants during the period of their service as specified in the rules of the Fund.

# 36.1.3 Post-Retirement Medical Benefits (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates a non-funded scheme for post-retirement medical benefits for all employees. All clerical employees who retired before May 24, 2022 receive reimbursements when incurred, against this benefit. Those who retired on or after May 24, 2022 also have the option to receive a one-time lump sum payment in lieu of reimbursements. Executives and officers who retired prior to January 1, 2006 receive these benefits as reimbursements when incurred. Executives and officers who retire after January 1, 2006 receive a one-time lump sum payment. However, those who are given a post-retirement contract up to the age of 65 years with effect from September 1, 2022, will receive this one-time lump sum payment at the time of expiry of the employment contract.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 36.1.4 Compensated Absences (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates a non-funded scheme for compensated absences. This is applicable to those employees who were in the service of the Bank as at December 31, 2008 and who had accumulated leave balances. Employees are entitled to proceed on Leave Prior to Retirement (LPR) to the extent of their accrued leave or 365 days whichever is lower, while continuing to receive their gross salary. This benefit vests on retirement or, in the case of premature retirement, on the completion of 30 years of service. However, in the case of death in service, the benefit is encashed up to 50% of accrued leave or 180 days, whichever is lower.

Employees may be required by the Bank to continue working during the whole or a part of their LPR period. Such employees are entitled to salary and certain benefits during the period they are required to work and, additionally, to leave encashment up to 50% of their accrued leave balance, up to a maximum of 180 days.

Clerical employees have the option of not proceeding on LPR and instead encashing 50% of their accumulated leave balance up to a maximum of 180 days.

# 36.1.5 Other Post-Retirement Benefits (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank offers a non-funded scheme for executives. Under this scheme, a lump sum amount equal to six months of house rent, utilities, car and conveyance allowances is paid to the executive on retirement. However, in the case of death in service, the lump sum amount includes an additional six months of house rent allowance.

# 36.1.6 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (defined benefit scheme)

The Bank operates a pension and life assurance scheme for those employees who joined its UK operations prior to December 26, 2001. The scheme was established with effect from May 1, 1978 under a Trust Deed of that date and is governed by that Trust Deed together with various supplemental and amending deeds executed over the lifetime of the scheme.

The triennial actuarial valuation as at May 1, 2019 revealed a deficit of £1.7 million under the Statement of Funding Principles. In order to address this deficit, the Bank will pay the amount after receiving regulatory approval.

# 36.2 Principal actuarial assumptions

The funds primarily invest in Government securities (Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds and Special Savings Certificates) which do not carry any credit risk but are subject to interest rate risk based on market movements. Equity securities are subject to price risk whereas non-Government debt securities are subject to both credit risk and interest rate risk. These risks are regularly monitored by the Trustees of the employee funds.

# 36.4.11 Funding Policy

The Bank endeavors to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the assets of the Fund on any valuation date, based on actuarial assumptions.

# 36.4.12 The significant risks associated with the defined benefit schemes are as follows:

- Mortality risks: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.
- Investment risks: The risk that the investments of the Funds will underperform and not be sufficient to meet the liabilities.
- Final salary risks: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is higher than what was assumed. Since the benefit is calculated based on the final salary, the benefit amount increases similarly.
- Withdrawal risks: The risk of higher or lower withdrawal experience than assumed. The impact depends on the beneficiaries’ service / age distribution and the benefit.

# 39 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices.

The fair values of unquoted equity investments are estimated using the break-up value of the investee company.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these unconsolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2 and level 3:

- Federal Government securities: The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices taken from Reuters.
- Non-Government debt securities: Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Investments in non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.
- Foreign Government debt securities: The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.
- Units of mutual funds: The fair values of units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.
- Derivatives: The Bank enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.
- Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions: The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.
- Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims: Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements.

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022


# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 43.1 Capital management

The Bank’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, depositor, creditor and market confidence and
to sustain future development of the business, while providing adequate returns to shareholders.

The Bank’s lead regulator, the SBP, sets and monitors capital requirements for the Bank as a whole. The Bank's branches
outside Pakistan are also required to follow capital requirements applicable in their respective jurisdictions.

The SBP, through BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has required that Banks should maintain a minimum paid-up capital
of Rs. 10 billion (net of accumulated losses). The paid-up capital of the Bank as at December 31, 2022 stood at Rs 14.669
billion (2021: Rs. 14.669 billion) and is in compliance with SBP requirements.

The Bank and its individually regulated operations have complied with all capital requirements.

The Bank’s regulatory capital is classified as follows:

- Tier 1 capital comprises of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) and Additional Tier 1 (AT 1) capital.
- CET1 capital includes fully paid-up capital, balance in share premium account, reserves (excluding exchange translation
reserves) and unappropriated profit meeting the eligibility criteria.
- AT 1 capital includes perpetual TFCs meeting the prescribed SBP criteria.
- Tier 2 capital includes general provisions for loan losses, surplus / (deficit) on revaluation of fixed assets and investments,
exchange translation reserves.

Banking operations are categorised as either Trading Book or Banking Book, and risk-weighted assets are determined
according to specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to on and off-balance sheet.

On and off-balance sheet exposures in the banking book are segregated into various asset classes for the calculation of
credit risk. Ratings reflecting the credit worthiness of counterparties are applied using various External Credit Assessment
Institutions (ECAIs) and are aligned with appropriate risk buckets. Collateral, if any, is used as an outflow adjustment.
Eligible collateral used includes Government of Pakistan (GoP) guarantees, GoP issued securities, bank guarantees, lien on
deposits and margin accounts. Risk weights notified by the SBP are applied to net exposures to arrive at risk weighted
assets.

The Bank calculates capital requirements for market risk in its trading book based on the methodology provided by the SBP,
which takes into account interest rate risk using the maturity method, equity position risk and foreign exchange risk.

# 43.2

The full disclosures on the Capital Adequacy Ratio, Leverage Ratio & Liquidity Requirements calculated as per SBP instructions
issued from time to time have been placed on the Bank's website. The link to the full disclosure is available at
https://www.hbl.com/capitalandliquidity.

# 44 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

HBL has a well-developed and robust risk management framework, appropriate for its size, regional and target market
diversification and the high complexity of its operations. The Bank’s risk management framework includes a clearly documented
risk appetite, well-articulated policies and procedures and a multi-tier management supervision, supported by strong Board
oversight.

The Board of Directors provides the strategic direction for effective risk management and ensures that a robust risk
management framework is in place, covering all aspects of the Bank's operations, including the required human resources,
policies, procedures, and systems, and is updated regularly to safeguard the Bank against emerging risks. It is supported in this
task by the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) as well as by various management committees.



NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

For effective implementation of the risk management framework, the Risk Management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), operates independently of the business units within the Bank. Risk Management is responsible for the development and implementation of risk policies and for monitoring the risks associated with various activities of the Bank. The CRO reports to the President, with a functional reporting line to the BRMC.

The Risk Management function comprises of the following areas:

- Credit Approvals
- Credit Administration
- Program Based Lending Risk
- Market Risk & Financial Risk Modeling
- Enterprise Risk Management
- Risk Corporate Governance

# 44.1 Credit risk management

Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss stemming from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. While loans are the largest and most obvious source of credit risk, it also stems from both on and off-balance sheet activities. The credit process at the Bank is governed by well-defined and documented credit policies and procedures including separate policies for consumer loans, agriculture banking and SME financing. Certain types of exposures / facilities are managed under product programs that contain their own detailed credit criteria, compliance and documentation requirements.

The Bank's credit risk appetite is defined through a Global Risk Appetite Statement that is approved by the Board. It also covers the concentration risks the Bank is willing to take with reference to risk ratings, sectors and large exposures. The core pillars of credit risk management at the Bank are:

- Approval rules based on a three-initial system and joint Business / Risk sign-offs.
- An independent Internal Audit function which includes a Business Risk Review (BRR) unit.

Credit approval authorities are delegated to individuals based on their qualifications and experience. Disbursement authorization, collateral and security management, documentation and monitoring are managed by the Credit Administration Department. Proactive monitoring is ensured for assets under stress. This enables the Bank to put in place viable solutions to prevent further deterioration in credit quality. An independent Structured Credits and Remedial Assets function handles stressed assets and ensures a focused remedial strategy.

Credit risk management software to automate loan origination has been implemented domestically for Corporate, Commercial and Retail (non-program based) lending and is being rolled out to overseas locations. The software is designed to improve approval efficiency; enable capture, storage and retrieval of approval data; and generate MIS for decision making. Stress testing on the credit portfolio is performed in line with SBP guidelines. In addition to the mandatory stress tests defined by the regulator, the Bank has also developed advanced stress tests for credit risk including macroeconomic stress tests, and reverse stress tests to test the adequacy of the Bank's capital under various stress conditions. The Bank also regularly conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks.

The Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives including the establishment of a Financial Risk Modelling and Stress Testing unit to strengthen its credit risk management framework including in-house development, back testing, validation of credit risk scorecards, internal risk ratings (obligor risk rating and facility risk rating) and probability of default models for the portfolio. The performance of the risk rating models over the years is continuously monitored.

BRR performs an independent review of the credit portfolio. It provides an independent assessment of portfolio quality by reviewing the efficacy of the relevant processes, ensuring regulatory / policy compliance, and assessing the appropriateness of classification and risk ratings.

# 44.1.1 Credit risk - general disclosures

The Bank follows the Standardized Approach for its credit risk exposures, which sets out fixed risk weights corresponding to external credit ratings or type of exposure, whichever is applicable.

HBL ANNUAL REPORT 2022

# NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

Under the Standardized Approach, the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to counterparties by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognized by the SBP. The Bank selects different ECAIs for each type of exposure. The Bank utilizes credit ratings assigned by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA), Vital Information Services (VIS), Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor's (S&P). The Bank also utilizes rating scores of Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).

NOTES TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 44.1.2 Credit Risk Mitigation for under the Standardized Approach

The Bank has adopted the Simple Approach for Credit Risk Mitigation in the banking book. Under this approach, cash, deposits under lien, Government securities and eligible guarantees etc. are considered as eligible collateral. The Bank has detailed guidelines regarding the valuation and management of each of these types of collateral. Where the Bank’s exposure on an obligor is wholly or partially guaranteed by an eligible guarantee, the risk weight / credit rating of the guarantor is substituted for the risk weight of the obligor.

No credit risk mitigation benefit is taken in the trading book. For each asset class, the risk weights as specified by the SBP or corresponding to the SBP rating grades are applied to the net exposure for the calculation of Risk Weighted Assets.

# 44.1.3 Country Risk

The Bank has in place a comprehensive Country Risk Policy. Limits are established for Cross Border Transfer Risk (CBTR) based on the ratings assigned by international rating agencies. CBTR arises from exposure to counterparties in countries other than the jurisdiction of the lender. Transfer risk arises where an otherwise solvent and willing debtor is unable to meet its obligations due to the imposition of governmental or regulatory controls restricting its ability to meet its foreign liabilities. The limit utilization is controlled at Head Office level and country risk exposures are reported to the BRMC at defined frequencies.

# 44.2     Market Risk Management

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to movements in market prices. It results from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices as well as from changes in the correlations between them. Each of these components of market risk consists of a general market risk and a specific market risk that is driven by the nature and composition of the portfolio.

The Bank is exposed to market risk in a number of ways. The largest component is Interest Rate Risk on the Banking Book, which refers to the interest rate risk that the Bank is exposed to due to mismatches in the repricing of its on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. The Bank also has Trading Books in various markets; these assets are marked-to-market at fair value, i.e. changes in the values of the assets arising from movements in the market price of the instruments are directly reflected in the Bank’s profit and loss account.

The objective of the Bank's market risk management strategy is to assess an acceptable level of risk for each market variable (as stated in the Bank’s Risk Appetite Statement), and to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in these variables to optimize the Bank’s income streams.

Treasury and Global Markets is tasked with proactively managing exposures. The Bank's ALCO provides governance with respect to market risk exposures and limits, while monitoring and measurement is carried out by Market Risk Management (MRM).

MRM provides a dynamic and proactive approach to market risk monitoring, including the use of tools such as portfolio sensitivity, scenario analysis, stress testing and the use of Management Action Triggers (MAT) and limits.

# 44.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Bank manages this risk by setting and monitoring currency-wise exposure limits. The Bank’s assets in a particular currency are typically funded in the same currency to minimize foreign currency exposure. However, the Bank maintains a net open position in various currencies resulting from its transactions. Foreign exchange risk is controlled and monitored through limits approved by ALCO, within the overall limit advised by the SBP.

# 44.2.3 Equity Position Risk

Equity position risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in the prices of individual stocks or the levels of equity indices. The Bank takes exposures to a range of equity instruments, and is exposed to losses arising from movements in equity prices. The Bank holds equity investments in both the AFS and HFT portfolios. The realization of short term capital gains is the principal objective of the HFT portfolio while the AFS portfolio takes a medium-term market view with the objective of earning both capital gains and dividend income. The portfolios are managed by the Bank within the structure encapsulated in the Equity Investment Policy approved by the Board, which defines position limits, portfolio limits and loss triggers for the equity desk. The Bank also applies stress tests on the equity portfolio which is part of the Bank’s overall market risk exposure limit on the trading book.

# 44.2.4 Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises due to changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of the yield curve. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk in both the Trading and Banking Books. Interest rate sensitivity analysis is conducted at both Banking Book and Trading Book levels, at least on a monthly basis or more frequently, if required. The analysis helps in estimating and managing the impact of interest rate volatility on the Bank’s earnings and on the economic value of equity within defined tolerance limits. Limits are also in place for fixed income investments of the treasury portfolio at dealer, transaction, portfolio and Trading / Banking Book levels. Regulatory stress testing is conducted on a quarterly basis. Metrics to assess Interest Rate Risk include Interest Rate Gap Reports, Earnings at Risk (EAR) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE). These metrics are assessed based on different stress scenarios. To further strengthen interest rate risk management, the Bank has developed a standardized framework to for computing the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under the updated guidelines issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Standards.

# FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

# 44.3 Enterprise Risk Management

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function was set up in 2020, and is applicable to all functions within the Bank, thus ensuring a robust and consistent approach to risk management across the organization.

The Bank’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, approved by the Board, outlines the essential ERM components, principles and concepts, and suggests the use of a common ERM language, while providing a clear direction and guidance for integrated risk management within the Bank. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is distributed through the delegation of accountability to individuals, with reporting and escalation facilitated through a governance structure. Standards, policies, and limits are well defined to ensure tasks and processes are consistently controlled.

During the year, a Bank-wide Risk and Control Repository has been created with the objective of identifying all risks and issues in a holistic manner across the entire organization and ensuring that they are adequately monitored and mitigated. The ERM function also includes a Model Risk Management unit that provides independent review and validation of all models being used in the Bank.

# 44.3.1 Operational Risk Management (ORM)

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

A comprehensive ORM Framework is in place which address all significant aspects of ORM. The Bank uses loss data management, Risk and Control Self Assessments and tracking of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to gauge the likelihood and severity of operational risk. The SAS software is used to facilitate this process. Operational Risk coordinators have been assigned from all departments of the Bank and are responsible for implementation of the Framework in coordination with the ORM department. An Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) monitors and oversees operational risk issues. The Bank uses stress testing to proactively assess impact on the Bank. RCSA exercises are conducted at regular intervals across the Bank. Operational risk reports are regularly submitted to the senior management and the BRMC.

# 44.3.2 Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

It is the policy of the Bank to maintain a well-defined business continuity plan with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and ownership for crisis management, to ensure business continuity and IT disaster recovery. The Bank’s Business Continuity Steering Committee, includes representation from the senior management of the Bank and is the governing body for BCP. It meets on a periodic basis to review key initiatives, testing results and action plans for strengthening the Bank’s ability to manage crisis situations. The Bank’s business continuity program complies with the regulatory framework and the leading Business Continuity Management standard, ISO 22301. The business continuity program is subject to regular internal, external and regulatory reviews and audits.

# 44.3.3 IT related controls

During the year, the Bank's IT controls were further strengthened, with special focus on controls around testing and quality assurance of all the products or solutions taken into production. Enhanced focus and visibility was given to IT Audit and Compliance, and several control / monitoring and technology hygiene initiatives were launched in close coordination with the Internal Audit and Global Compliance. A formal procedure for IT Risk Management was introduced to identify and mitigate potential risks in a centralized manner. This has been further aligned with the Enterprise Technology Governance and Risk Management (ETGRM) framework. IT Risk Coordinators, aligned with the enterprise-wide Risk Coordinators have been introduced to ensure that risks are reported and coordinated regularly. An IT Risk Register has been developed to track and monitor IT risks; the process will be automated in 2023 aligned with other areas of the Bank.

# 44.3.4 Information Security Risk

It is vitally important for the Bank to protect its customers and their data from cyberattacks and to provide secure banking services. Information Security plays a pivotal role in protecting the Bank’s data assets from both internal and external threats through effective cyber security risk management, supported by preventive and detective controls capable of responding to emerging external threats.

Targeted and frequent information security awareness initiatives for customers and employees were launched using multiple delivery channels, to elevate their level of awareness and better equip them to counter security challenges. Significant progress has also been made in raising information security standards at international locations to a level consistent with the policies, standards, and controls implemented for the domestic business.

Moving forward, the Bank plans to strengthen its cyber-defenses through the use of automation and modern technologies, in particular, AI and machine learning. Furthermore, the Bank will work towards further alignment of its information security operations center with international best practices.

Customers are an important component of the security process and continuous customer education about cyber risks will remain an important component of our defense strategy. These security measures will allow the Bank to continue offering innovative digital solutions to its clients while ensuring them protection and peace of mind.

# 44.4 Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may be unable to meet its cash obligations as they become due, or to fund assets, at a reasonable cost, because of the inability to liquidate assets, or to obtain adequate funding.

The Bank follows a comprehensive liquidity risk management policy duly approved by the Board. The policy provides guidelines for establishing a robust liquidity risk management framework which helps in identifying the key liquidity and funding risks to which the bank is exposed, describes how these risks are identified, measured, monitored and reported, and prescribes the techniques and resources used to manage and mitigate these risks. The policy stipulates maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of the Bank’s liquidity under normal and crisis situations (stress testing).

The Bank also has a Contingency Funding Plan in place to address liquidity issues in times of crisis. This plan identifies early warning indicators to preempt unforeseen liquidity crises. Triggers are used to ascertain potential stress scenarios.

The Bank’s ALCO is responsible for the formulation of overall strategy and oversight of asset and liability management. Liquidity Risk is monitored using a range of metrics, including Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR); liquidity gaps and various liquidity ratios are regularly monitored by Market Risk Management. Liquidity risk is reviewed by ALCO on a monthly basis and an update is provided to the BRMC on a quarterly basis.

Measurement and monitoring of market and credit risk limits and exposure, and their reporting to senior management and the Board is done by Market Risk Management (MRM) which, in coordination with the business, also presents limits for review and approval to ALCO and the BRMC. Treasury Operations records derivatives activity in the Bank’s books, executes settlements of trades and carries out regulatory reporting to the SBP.

# 44.5.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of non-performance by a counterparty which could result in an adverse impact on the Bank’s profitability. The credit risk associated with derivative transactions is categorized into settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Pre-settlement and settlement risk limits for derivative transactions are determined and monitored daily using an approved framework.

# 44.5.2 Market Risk

The Bank, as a policy, hedges all Options transactions back-to-back. The Bank minimizes the exchange rate risk on its Cross Currency Swaps portfolio by hedging the exposure in the interbank market on a rolling basis. The Bank also manages the interest rate risk of Interest Rate Derivatives and Cross Currency Swaps through Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) limits which are monitored and reported by MRM to senior management on a daily basis. These limits are approved by ALCO annually and then approved by the Board on the recommendation of the BRMC.

# 44.5.3 Operational Risk

The Bank has put in place a robust control framework for derivatives transactions. Front office staff dealing in derivatives have the requisite training and experience to conduct this business; responsibilities have been divided amongst the Structuring Desk (tasked with the overall ownership of derivatives and structured products), Treasury Sales (who are involved in marketing and executing transactions with the Bank’s client base) and Trading (which proactively manages the risk from a business perspective). A detailed product program, approved by the Board, governs the entire value chain for derivatives, including credit and market risk management, booking, sales and settlement. There is a clear segregation of duties whereby operational aspects are handled by Treasury Operations, whereas all risk issues are the responsibility of the Risk department. A Treasury Middle Office function, reporting into Risk, carries out daily monitoring of exposures, while, Compliance monitors any deviation from approved policies and procedures. Internal Audit also regularly reviews systems, transactional processes, accounting practices and end-user roles and responsibilities as part of their reviews of this function.

# 44.5.4 Liquidity Risk

The types of derivative transactions entered into by HBL are typically straightforward, or ‘vanilla’ transactions, whereby the Bank is exposed to a negligible amount of liquidity risk.
