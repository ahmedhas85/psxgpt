DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

It is our pleasure to present the un-audited financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited along with the un-audited consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited and the Bank’s Subsidiaries AL Habib Capital Markets (Private) Limited and AL Habib Asset Management Limited for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

Alhamdolillah, during the period under review, the performance of the Bank continued to be satisfactory. The deposits increased to Rs. 1,367.5 billion as compared to Rs. 1,309.8 billion on December 31, 2021. In the same period, advances increased to Rs. 747.2 billion from Rs. 733.8 billion, while investments decreased to Rs. 753.5 billion from Rs. 826.6 billion. The pre-tax profit of the Bank for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was Rs. 8.18 billion as compared to Rs. 7.06 billion during the corresponding period last year. The profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was Rs. 4.96 billion compared with Rs. 4.60 billion during 2021.

By the Grace of Allah, the Bank now has a network of 990 offices, comprising 957 branches, 29 sub-branches, and 4 Representative Offices. Our branch network includes 142 Islamic Banking Branches and 2 Overseas Branches. Continuing with our branch expansion policy, the Bank intends to open more branches during the year 2022.

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) have been upgraded from AA+ (Double A Plus) to AAA (Triple A) for TFC-2018 and TFC-2021, and AA (Double A) to AA+ (Double A Plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

We wish to thank our customers, for their continued trust and support, local & foreign correspondents for their confidence and cooperation, and the State Bank of Pakistan for their guidance. We also thank all our staff members for their sincerity, dedication and hard work.

The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- IFAS issued by the ICAP, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).




Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by SBP and SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 05, dated 22 March 2019 and International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'. They do not include all the information required in the annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021.

SBP has deferred the applicability of IAS 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' and IAS 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies in Pakistan through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated 26 August 2002 till further instructions. Further, SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 24 of 2021 dated 05 July 2021 directed the banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' with effect from 01 January 2022. SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by SBP through various circulars. In case of overseas branches, IFRS 9 / respective foreign regulatory requirements are considered for recording, classification and valuation of investment.

SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated 25 February 2015, has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly financial statements would be notified by SBP though issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements.

IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was made applicable from period beginning on or after 01 January 2015 vide S.R.O 633 (I) / 2014 dated 10 July 2014 by SECP. However, SECP has directed through S.R.O 56 (I) / 2016 dated 28 January 2016 that the requirement of consolidation under section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 and IFRS 10, 'Consolidated Financial Statements' is not applicable in case of investment by companies in mutual funds established under trust structure.

Income tax returns of the Bank have been submitted upto and including the Bank’s financial year 2020 (Tax Year 2021) including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. The income tax assessments of the Bank (including Azad Kashmir operations) have been finalized upto and including tax year 2019. Tax year 2020 has been finalized for Azad Kashmir operations only. Matters of disagreement exist between the Bank and tax authorities for various tax years and are pending with the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). These issues mainly relate to addition of general provision (specific), reversal of provision for non-performing loans, charge for defined benefit plan and provision for compensated absences.

While finalizing the income tax assessments in respect of tax years 2009, 2011, 2012 to 2019 (excluding 2017), income tax authorities made certain add backs. As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), certain add backs have been deleted, resulting in aggregate net tax impact of Rs. 987.344 million. The Bank has filed appeal before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) against above mentioned orders.

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Duty levy on certain items for the period from 2013 to 2015 thereby creating aggregate demand of Rs. 80.766 million. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) has remanded back the order of Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR).

Commissioner (HQ), Punjab Revenue Authority has passed order for the year 2016 levying Punjab Sales Tax on services on certain items resulting in an impact of Rs. 112.641 million. Appellate Tribunal – Punjab Revenue Authority has remanded back the order of Commissioner (HQ), Punjab Revenue Authority.

Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue, Mirpur AJ&K made certain add backs with an aggregate tax impact of Rs. 192.362 million for tax years 2014 to 2020. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), Mirpur AJ&K has annulled the amendments for tax years 2014 to 2018. The appeal for tax years 2019 to 2020 is pending before Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), Mirpur AJ&K, having an aggregate net tax impact of Rs. 98.919 million.

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

SECP has deferred the applicability of IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' through its notification S.R.O 411 (I) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

The income tax assessments of the Bank (including Azad Kashmir operations) have been finalized upto and including tax year 2019. Tax year 2020 has been finalized for Azad Kashmir operations only. Matters of disagreement exist between the Bank and tax authorities for various tax years and are pending with the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). These issues mainly relate to addition of general provision (specific), reversal of provision for non-performing loans, charge for defined benefit plan and provision for compensated absences.

While finalizing the income tax assessments in respect of tax years 2009, 2011, 2012 to 2019 (excluding 2017), income tax authorities made certain add backs. As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), certain add backs have been deleted, resulting in aggregate net tax impact of Rs. 987.344 million. The Bank has filed appeal before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) against above mentioned orders.

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Duty levy on certain items for the period from 2013 to 2015 thereby creating aggregate demand of Rs. 80.766 million. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) has remanded back the order of Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR).

Commissioner (HQ), Punjab Revenue Authority has passed order for the year 2016 levying Punjab Sales Tax on services on certain items resulting in an impact of Rs. 112.641 million. Appellate Tribunal – Punjab Revenue Authority has remanded back the order of Commissioner (HQ), Punjab Revenue Authority.

Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue, Mirpur AJ&K made certain add backs with an aggregate tax impact of Rs. 192.362 million for tax years 2014 to 2020. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), Mirpur AJ&K has annulled the amendments for tax years 2014 to 2018. The appeal for tax years 2019 to 2020 is pending before Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), Mirpur AJ&K, having an aggregate net tax impact of Rs. 98.919 million.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Fair value of financial instruments is based on:

- Federal Government Securities: PKRV rates (Reuters page)
- Non Government Debt Securities: Market prices
- Foreign Securities: Market prices / Mashreqbank PSC
- Listed Securities: Prices quoted at Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited
- Mutual Funds: Net asset values declared by respective funds

Fair value of fixed term advances of over one year, staff loans and fixed term deposits of over one year cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to non-availability of relevant active market for similar assets and liabilities. The provision for impairment of debt securities and loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.



# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
