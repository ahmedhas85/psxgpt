Directors’ Report to the Member
Dear Members,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Condensed Interim Un-audited Financial Statements of BankIslami Pakistan Limited (‘the Bank’ or ‘BankIslami’) along with the consolidated Financial Statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.

# Economy Snapshot

Pakistan’s economy continued on a gradual recovery path as real GDP grew by 1.34% and 1.73% over first and second quarters of FY2024-25 respectively. Although agriculture, Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM), and construction posted decline, however, services and livestock sectors led the growth in real GDP. Outlook remains steady for FY2024-25 i.e., GDP is expected in the range of 2.5 – 3.5% (FY2023-24: 2.5%), as predicted rainfalls are likely to uplift agricultural output, while any reduction in policy rate would improve LSM growth.

Disinflation trend continues where headline CPI inflation continues to slide with March 2025 reading standing at 0.7%. This figure is significantly lower than the 1.5% recorded in February 2025 and the 20.7% recorded in March 2024. Significant decline in headline CPI inflation is primarily attributed to a favorable base effect as food inflation reported a decline of 5.1% on year on year basis while increasing by 1.9% on month on month basis.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 12% in its meeting in March 2025. Although February 2025 inflation came in lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in food and energy prices however, the Committee noted that the volatility in these prices could disrupt the downward inflation trend. Core inflation still remains high, and any increase in food or energy prices could push inflation up. Economic activity is gaining momentum, but external pressures are building due to rising imports and relatively weak financial inflows. Overall, the MPC believes the current real interest rate is adequately positive to maintain macroeconomic stability.

The external account remained strong with a Current Account surplus of USD 691 million during the first eight months of FY2024-25, compared to a deficit of USD 1,730 million in the same period last year. However, a deficit of USD 411 million was recorded in January and February 2025, mainly due to a higher trade deficit. The combined balance of goods and services for July-Feb FY25 showed a deficit of USD 18.7 billion, up from USD 15.8 billion last year. On a positive note, remittances increased by 32.5%, reaching to USD 24 billion during the first eight months of FY2024-25 providing necessary respite to current account balance.

SBP’s foreign exchange reserves decreased to USD 10.7 billion by the first week of April 2025, down from USD 11.7 billion in December 2024. On March 10, 2025, the Pakistani rupee saw a minor decline of 0.04%, depreciating by Re 0.10 against the US dollar, closing at over 280 in the inter-bank market for the first time in more than a year. Despite this, SBP anticipates an increase of USD 14 billion in reserves by the end of June 2025, which is expected to have a positive impact.

Moreover, during March 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) successfully completed its first review of Pakistan’s USD 7 billion, 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The resulting Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) also includes a USD 1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for climate change. Following approval by the IMF Executive Board, Pakistan is expected to receive USD 2 billion in Q2 CY2025, split between USD 1 billion from the IMF-EFF and USD 1 billion from the IMF-RSF.

4 | Quarterly Report March 2025


Pakistan’s current macroeconomic landscape specifies gradual stabilization with improved external account, low inflation, and subdued real growth. Long-term moderate growth depends upon implementation of structural reforms particularly in the energy sector, disciplined fiscal management, meaningful governance reforms, privatization of state owned entities, and expansion in industrial investments. Similarly, key risks include further expansion in energy sector circular debt, unmet external financing requirements, volatile international trade dynamics, and evolving climate-related challenges.

Alhamdulillah! the Bank continues to build on its growth trajectory. As of March 31, 2025, the Bank achieved a 16.1% increase in its deposit portfolio compared to March 31, 2024 mainly contributed by Current and Saving Accounts that grew by 52.3% and 40.4% respectively. As compared to December 2024, the deposit portfolio witnessed growth of 3.1%. Further, the Bank’s strategic focus on expanding its CASA (Current Account and Savings Account) deposit mix through initiatives like focusing trade finance, employee banking, and cash management services are yielding positive results. The Bank has maintained a stable and resilient CASA of over 60% for the past three years. This not only reflects customer confidence but also highlights the Bank’s commitment to maintaining a balanced and sustainable funding structure.




During the current period, the Bank’s gross financing portfolio declined by 3.8%, primarily due to the settlement of large financings, while ADR decreased from 58.5% in December 2024 to 54.6% in March 2025. Going forward, the Bank will strategically focus on selective large corporate, commercial and SME clients, leveraging current financing opportunities and exploring new investment avenues.

On the risk management front, the Bank’s focused strategies aligned with its growth momentum have yielded positive results. The infection ratio improved slightly, decreasing from 7.4% at the end of December 2024 to 7.2% despite the reduction in the financing portfolio. In absolute terms, the delinquent financing portfolio decreased by Rs. 1.49 billion during the current period. The Bank continues to maintain a robust provision against its non-performing financing portfolio, resulting in a coverage ratio of 109.5% as of March 2025. The Bank’s specialized recovery team is actively working to recover delinquent assets, with the goal of further reducing the infection ratio over time.

The Bank strategically deployed surplus liquidity into investments, resulting in an increase in the investment portfolio to Rs. 347.26 billion as of March 2025, compared to Rs. 345.05 billion as of December 2024. The primary investments were made in GoP Ijarah Sukuk, while also strategically increasing the equity portfolio.

A strong capital foundation is crucial for sustaining a robust asset portfolio. As of March 31, 2025, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stands at 22.89%, reflecting a modest decline from 24.11% as of December 31, 2024. This slight reduction in CAR is primarily attributable to a decrease in the financing portfolio and a reduction in surplus related to GoP Ijarah Sukuk, following a decline in policy rates.

Alhamdulillah! the Bank’s total income grew by 6.3%, showcasing its resilience in navigating the challenges posed by the decline in policy rates, which has dropped by 1,000 basis points since March 2024. Operating expenses rose by 44%, increasing from Rs. 4.89 billion in March 2024 to Rs. 7.05 billion in the current period. This increase is mainly attributed to inflationary pressures, as well as the Bank’s strategic expansion efforts, including the opening of new branches and investments in technology to support sustainable growth. Owing to above, pre-tax profit declined by Rs. 816 million as compared to March 2024. Nonetheless, the Bank remains committed to its efforts during challenging times and witnessed growth by leveraging on opportunities in both financing and investments, alongside a strategic focus on areas such as Digital Delivery Channels, Cash Management, Home Remittance, Investment Banking, and Trade.

# Group Results

For the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Group recorded a modest growth of 0.5% in total assets compared to December 31, 2024. This growth was primarily driven by the expansion of the investments portfolio, particularly in GoP Ijarah Sukuks and listed equity instruments of blue chip companies. However, the financing portfolio witnessed a decline of 3.8% during the period. The Group achieved a pre-tax profit of Rs. 5.5 billion, reflecting a decrease of 12.94% compared to the same period last year. This decline was largely attributable to a significant reduction in the policy rate, persistent inflationary pressures, and the continued expansion of the Group’s business operations.

# 1 STATUS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

1.1 BankIslami Pakistan Limited (the Bank) was incorporated in Pakistan on October 18, 2004 as a public limited company to carry out the business of an Islamic Commercial Bank in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) granted a ‘Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank’ license to the Bank on March 18, 2005. The Bank commenced its operations as a Scheduled Islamic Commercial Bank with effect from April 07, 2006 on receiving Certificate of Commencement of Business from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) under section 37 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956. The Bank is principally engaged in corporate, commercial, consumer, retail banking and investment activities.

The Bank is operating through 540 branches including 60 sub-branches as at March 31, 2025 (December 31, 2024: 540 branches including 60 sub-branches). The registered office of the Bank is situated at 11th Floor, Dolmen City Executive Tower, Marine Drive, Block-4, Clifton, Karachi. The shares of the Bank are quoted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited.

The Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (Private) Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long-term rating to 'AA-' and short-term rating at 'A1' with stable outlook.

On August 18, 2023, JS Bank Limited increased its shareholding in the Bank from 7.79% to 50.24% by acquiring shares from existing shareholders of the Bank through Share Purchase Agreement (SPA), effectively making BankIslami Pakistan Limited a subsidiary of JS Bank Limited. The shareholding in the Bank was further increased to 75.12% on August 25, 2023 by way of acquiring Bank’s shares through a public offer.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Bank provides financing mainly through Murabaha, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Import Murabaha, Salam, Musawamah, Running Musharaka (Shirkat-ul-Aqd), Ijarah and other Islamic modes briefly explained in note no. 7.5 to of unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognized in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognized as charity payable as directed by the Shariah Board of the Bank.

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

# 2.2

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

Notes to and Forming Part of the Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements For the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

# 2.3

The SBP, through its BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002, has deferred the implementation of IAS 40 - "Investment Property" for Banking Companies in Pakistan, till further instructions. Accordingly, the requirements of these Standards have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" through its S.R.O. 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of this standard have also not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. However non-banking assets have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the SBP.

# 2.4

The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS-3 for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly unconsolidated financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 2.5

The Bank received an extension from SBP up to December 31, 2025 for application of EPR in general for all financial assets and liabilities (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans), however as financial assets other than financing and financial liabilities were already effectively carried at EPR before the implementation of IFRS 9 hence said extension has only been applied on Islamic financing (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans i.e. Temporary Economic Refinance Facility). Therefore, Islamic financing are now carried at cost, excluding staff loans and TERF, which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances. Further, in accordance with the BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

# 2.6

The treatment of charity should be in line with the existing practices as defined in SBP instructions issued via IBD Circular No. 02 of 2008 and should not be recognized as income.

# 2.7

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

If the revenue had been recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 and SBP Application guidelines, the following impact on profit and loss would have resulted:

# 34 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortized cost or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

42 | Quarterly Report March 2025

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# 1.2.1 My Solutions Corporations Limited - 100 percent holding

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Holding Company provides financing mainly through Murabaha, Istisna, Diminishing Musharakah, Import Murabaha, Salam, Musawamah, Running Musharaka (Shirkat-ul-Aqd), Ijarah and other Islamic modes briefly explained in note no. 7.5 to of unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these consolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognized in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognized as charity payable as directed by the Shariah Board of the Holding Company.

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for financial reporting comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;

Quarterly Report March 2025 | 57

Notes to and Forming Part of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements For the Quarter ended March 31, 2025

- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;

- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and

- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

# 2.2

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS, IFRS or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

# 2.3

The SBP, through its BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002, has deferred the implementation of IAS 40 - “Investment Property” for Banking Companies in Pakistan, till further instructions. Accordingly, the requirements of these Standards have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” through its S.R.O. 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of this standard have also not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. However non-banking assets have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the SBP.

# 2.4

The SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 04 dated February 25, 2015 has clarified that the reporting requirements of IFAS-3 for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) relating to annual, half yearly and quarterly consolidated financial statements would be notified by SBP through issuance of specific instructions and uniform disclosure formats in consultation with IBIs. These reporting requirements have not been ratified to date. Accordingly, the disclosure requirements under IFAS 3 have not been considered in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# 2.5

The Holding Company received an extension from SBP up to December 31, 2025 for application of EPR in general for all financial assets and liabilities (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans), however as financial assets other than financing and financial liabilities were already effectively carried at EPR before the implementation of IFRS 9 hence said extension has only been applied on Islamic financing (excluding staff loans / subsidized loans i.e. Temporary Economic Refinance Facility). Therefore, Islamic financing are now carried at cost, excluding staff loans and TERF, which are carried at amortized cost, net of expected credit loss allowances.

Further, in accordance with the BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

# 2.6

The treatment of charity should be in line with the existing practices as defined in SBP instructions issued via IBD Circular No. 02 of 2008 and should not be recognized as income.

# 2.7

# Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Holding Company and the financial statements of subsidiary company from the date that control of the subsidiary by the Holding Company commences until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiary company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by The Holding Company is eliminated against the corresponding share capital of subsidiary in these consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the subsidiary company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company, except for non-banking subsidiaries in Pakistan which follow the requirements of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, IAS 40: Investment Property and IFRS - 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which are required to comply with local regulations enforced within the respective jurisdictions.

58 | Quarterly Report March 2025


Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated. Associates are those entities in which the Holding Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Holding Company has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

# 2.8

As per BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 of 2025 dated January 22, 2025, Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) are allowed to follow Islamic Financial accounting Standards (IFAS) 1 & 2 where applicable and continue the existing accounting methodology on other Islamic products until issuance of further instruction in this regard.

If the revenue had been recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 and SBP Application guidelines, the following impact on profit and loss would have resulted: -

|                                       | Rupees in ‘000 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Opening Retained Earning - net of tax | 837,455        |
| Profit and Loss Account - net of tax  | 243,045        |

# 33.1

There were no convertible / dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding as at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, therefore diluted earning per share has not been presented separately.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortized cost or investments in associates, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Holding Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:
