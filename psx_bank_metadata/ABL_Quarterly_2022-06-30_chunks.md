## Economic Review

Global recovery from COVID-19 pandemic is steering through a number of economic challenges. Increasing commodity and energy prices together with supply chain disruptions surged inflationary pressure globally. This has resulted in tightened monetary policy stance by most of the central banks. Recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and re-emergence of the pandemic in China have slowed down the economic activity across the world. Resultantly, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecasted a slowdown in baseline global growth to $3.2 \%$ in 2022 from $6.1 \%$ last year which is $0.4 \%$ lower than earlier projection made in April 2022.

Economy of Pakistan remained resilient, despite adverse impacts of subdued global economic outlook together with uncertain domestic environment. Resultantly, in July 2022, IMF forecasted real GDP Growth of Pakistan at 6.0\% in 2022 which was earlier estimated at $4.0 \%$ as compared to $5.7 \%$ in 2021.

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) witnessed broad-based growth in Food, Tobacco, Wearing Apparel, Textile, Chemicals, Automobiles, Iron \& Steel Products, Leather Products and Paper \& Paperboard sectors. LSM growth was recorded at $11.7 \%$ during Jul-May FY2022 as compared to $10.2 \%$ growth in the corresponding period last year.

Agriculture sector has recorded a growth of $4.40 \%$ during FY2022 and surpassed the target of $3.5 \%$ as well as last year's growth of $3.48 \%$. Agriculture credit disbursement also increased by $2.3 \%$ to Rs 1,219 billion during Jul-May FY2022 as compared to Rs 1,192 billion last year.

Exports showed a growth of $25 \%$ during FY2022 and reached at US\$ 39,418 million as compared to US\$ 31,584 million during last year. Textile, chemical \& pharmaceutical, manufactured leather and rice remained major sectors contributing in growth of exports. On the other hand, imports grew by $34 \%$ during FY2022 reaching at US\$ 84,191 million as compared to US\$ 62,734 million last year. Imports grew mainly because of higher volume and prices of energy and non-energy commodities.

Higher imports as compared to lower exports and modest growth in workers remittances translated into Current Account Deficit (CAD) which stood at US\$ 17,406 million for FY2022 as against a lower CAD of US\$ 2,820 million during last year.

Pakistan Net Foreign Reserves and Foreign Reserves with SBP were recorded at US\$ 15,537 million and US\$ 9,816 million as on June 30, 2022. During FY2022, Net Foreign Direct Investment was recorded at US\$ 1,868 million as compared to US\$ 1,821 million in last year showing an increase of $2.6 \%$. Whereas, Net Portfolio investment recorded an outflow of US\$ 79 million during FY2022 as compared to inflow of US\$ 2,762 million during last year.



<!-- Page 7 -->

Money supply (M2) registered a Year on Year (YoY) growth of 14\% and reached at Rs. 27,581,015 million as on June 30, 2022, whereas, currency in circulation stood at Rs. 7,572,465 million showing a YoY growth of 10\%.

On fiscal side, Federal Board of Revenue's tax collection exhibited YoY growth of 29\%. Total collection was recorded at Rs. 6,126 billion against target of Rs. 6,050 billion. In Jul-May FY2022, expenditures overran revenue growth; thus, Fiscal Deficit was recorded at $5.2 \%$ of GDP and the primary balance posted a deficit of Rs 945 billion.

In view of the prevailing uncertainty, investor sentiments remained bearish, KSE100 index closed at 41,541 points as on June 30, 2022 as compared to 47,356 points as on June 30, 2021, showing a decline of 12\%. Pakistan Rupee depreciated by $16 \%$ as compared to December 31, 2021 to stand at Rs. 204.85 as on June 30, 2022.

Headline inflation was recorded at $21.3 \%$ in the month of June FY2022, highest since 2008, as against $9.7 \%$ in the same month last year. Increasing food prices, high transportation cost and rising energy prices remained major drivers of inflation.

In view of this challenging situation, policy actions were required to moderate demand, prevent the compounding of inflationary pressures and to safeguard the external stability. Accordingly, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) continued with further tightening of monetary policy and policy rate has cumulatively been increased by 525 basis points since December 2021 to bring the policy rate at $15.00 \%$ on July 07, 2022.

## Chunk 4


# Financial Review 

During this challenging operating environment due to global economic slow-down, macroeconomic imbalances, rising inflationary pressures and tightening of monetary policy, the domestic banking sector's performance remained consistent.

Banking industry's assets base (domestic operations) registered a growth of $16 \%$ to reach at Rs. 33,542 billion as on June 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 28,882 billion as on December 31, 2021. Asset base growth is substantially driven on the back of investments and advances which increased by $23 \%$ and $8 \%$ respectively, from December 31, 2021. Industry deposits stood at Rs. 22,810 billion, achieving a growth of $9 \%$.

Your Bank continued its focus towards enriched technological infrastructures and digitally-induced financial offerings assisting in creating sustainable growth and value for the stakeholders. Thereby, contributing in achieving robust financial position with stable profitability.

Positive volumetric growth in average earning assets coupled with positive rate variance assisted in $64 \%$ increase in mark-up income to reach at Rs. 87,567 million during the half year ended June 30, 2022. Mark-up expense reached at Rs. 60,052 million showing a growth of $98 \%$ during the captioned period. The increase is mainly on account of higher cost of deposits due to increasing interest rate scenario. Net Interest Income (NII) was recorded at Rs. 27,515 million achieving a growth of $20 \%$ during the half year ended June 30, 2022.

Fee income has increased by Rs. 677 million, recording a growth of $21 \%$ to reach at Rs. 3,932 million mainly on account of higher card related fees and branch banking customer fees.

There was an increase of $21 \%$ in dividend income to reach at Rs. 1,325 million during the half year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 1,093 million in the corresponding period last year.

Foreign exchange income recorded a reasonable growth to reach at Rs. 4,296 million mainly attributable to increased volume of large ticket transactions. At the same time, the Bank remained an active participant in the interbank swap market. This is also counterbalancing the effect of decrease in other income which stands at Rs. 46 million for the half year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 270 million during the corresponding period last year. Decrease in other income is due to decrease in gain on disposal of fixed assets.

Resultantly, non-markup income increased by $35 \%$ to reach at Rs. 10,739 million during the half year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to Rs. 7,933 million for the corresponding period last year.

Administration expenses increased by $14 \%$ during the period under review as compared to $10 \%$ increase in the corresponding period last year.

Vide Finance Act 2022, for Banking companies, Corporate Tax rate is enhanced from 35\% to 39\%, Super Tax on high earning persons is levied for Tax Year 2023 (Income Year 2022) at 10\% and subsequently at 4\% and tax rate on attributable income from investments in Federal Government Securities is increased ( $49 \%$ for ADR 40\% to 50\%) retrospectively from Tax Year 2022 (Income Year 2021), which resulted in additional tax charge during the half year ended June 30, 2022. Resultantly, effective tax rate of the Bank increased to $65.8 \%$, amounting to Rs. 13,231 million as compared to $40.4 \%$ in corresponding half year period.

Profit after tax for the half year ended June 30, 2022 recorded at Rs. 6,887 million, lower by Rs. 1,875 million as compared to the corresponding half year ended June 30, 2021. In line with profit after tax, earnings per share (EPS) of Your Bank also decreased to Rs. 6.01 as compared to Rs. 7.65 against the same corresponding period.

Your Bank has always strived to provide seamless banking experiences and development of digital ecosystem. Therefore, Allied Bank has maintained a balanced approach for digital innovations and optimized expansion in branch banking operations.

Accordingly, IMF has downgraded the expected Global growth rate to $2.9 \%$ in 2023.

Supply chain disruptions and increasing commodity prices driven by geopolitical conflicts have worsened the inflation outlook expectation. IMF estimated inflation at $6.6 \%$ in advanced countries and $9.5 \%$ in emerging and developing economies in 2022.

On the domestic front, GDP growth is targeted at $5.0 \%$ in FY2023. Inflation is forecasted to sustain its current level till FY2023 after which it is expected to sharply fall to a range of $5 \%-7 \%$.

Developing innovative products and technology-based solutions have always been remained a focus of Your Bank. In order to improve customer experience and bring more convenience, the Bank has extended debit card replacement and upgrade services through Allied Phone Banking.

Your Bank's flagship digital banking platform myABL Digital is now catering to the financial needs of over 1.1 million customers and offering a wide range of banking services.

During the period, myABL WhatsApp Banking has also been augmented with the introduction of additional features.

## معاشی جائزہ :

کودڈ - 19 کی عالمگیر دباو سے بحالی کا عالمی سفر کئی ایک معاشی چیلنجز کاسامنا کر رہا ہے۔ اشیاء اور توانائی کی بدعتی قیمتیں اور اس کے ساتھ رسد کی تزیل میں درپیش رکاوٹوں نے پوری دنیا میں افراد لڑ کے دباؤ میں اضافہ کیا ہے۔ جس کے روکمل کے طور پر مرکزی چیلنجوں کی ایک کثیر تعداد نے کڑے مانیائی پالیسی کے بیانیہ کو اظہار کیا ہے۔ روٹن اور یوکرین کے مائین حالیہ تنازعہ اور چین میں عالمگیر دباو کے دوبارہ سرافمانے اور چیلاؤ سے دنیا بھر میں معاشی سرگرمیوں میں ست ردی دیکھی جارہی ہے۔ لہجہا، عالمی مانیائی فنڈ (آئی ایجانیف) نے عالمی بنیادی نمو کی رفتار میں کی کی توقع پر اس کی شرح، ترقی میں گزشتہ سال کی 6.1 لیصد حاصل شدہ سطح سے تخلیق کرتے ہوئے اگلے 3.2 لیصد تک رہنے کا مندیہ دیاہے جو اپریل 2022ء میں آئی ایجانیف کے ساتھ تحفے سے ملے 0.4 لیصد کم ہے۔

اس امر کے باوجود کہ عالمی معاشی پیش بینی میں ناموافقت اور غیر یقین واقعی صورتحال سے حاصل ملنی اثرات مرتب ہو رہے ہیں، پاکستان کی معیشت اپنی لیکداری اور مقابلے کی صلاحیت کو برقرار رکھے ہوئے ہے ۔ چنانچہ، جولائی 2021ء میں آئی ایجانیف نے سال 2022ء کے لیے پاکستان کے جی ڈی پی کی نمو کا تعین 6 لیصد پر کیا ہے جس کا ساتھ اندازہ سال 2021ء کی 5.7 لیصد کی ترقی کے مقابلے میں 4 لیصد پر کیا گیا تھا۔

# Independent Auditors' Review Report 

To the members of Allied Bank Limited

## REPORT ON REVIEW OF UNCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Allied Bank Limited ("the Bank") as at 30 June 2022, and the related unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the six month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements based on our review.

## Scope of review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

## Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

## Other matter

The figures for the condensed interim profit and loss account and condensed interim statement of comprehensive income for the three months period ended 30 June 2022 and 2021 have not been reviewed by us and we do not express a conclusion on them, as we are required to review only the cumulative figures for the six-month period ended 30 June 2022.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's report is Muhammad Ahsan Shahzad.

On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated 15.01.2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank.

## 35. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

### 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

| Level 1: | Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares. |
| :--: | :--: |
|  | Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government \& Exchange Contracts. |
| Level 3: | Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3. |

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

## Valuation Techniques used in determination of Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments within Level 2

| Item | Valuation approach and input used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Federal Government Securities | Marked to Market on the basis of PKRV rates. |
| Non-Government Debt Securities | Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates. |
| Foreign exchange contracts | Marked to Market on the basis of SBP rates. |
| Open ended mutual funds | Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates. |
| Operating fixed assets (land \& building) \& NBA | The valuation is based on their assessment of market value of the properties. |

23.3 Other contingent liabilities
23.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt $7,074,449 \quad 6,668,875$
23.3.2 The income tax assessments of the Group have been finalized upto and including tax year 2021 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments upto tax year 2021, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Group before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Group and Tax Department are in appeals / references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals / references no provision has been made by the Group on aggregate sum of Rs.32,753 million (2021: 32,753 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals / references will be in favor of the Group.

Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Group; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,720 million (2021: 1,720 million).

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005 / Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 963 million (2021: 963 million).

## 24 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Group at present does not offer structured derivative products such as Interest Rate Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements or FX Options. However, the Bank buys and sells derivative instruments such as:

- Forward Exchange Contracts
- Foreign Exchange Swaps
- Equity Futures
- Forward Contracts for Government Securities

The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives and definitions are same as those disclosed in audited annual unconsolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2021.

## 35. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

### 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as "held to maturity". Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy as stated in note 5.4 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government \& Exchange Contracts.
Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

Valuation Techniques used in determination of Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments within Level 2
Item
Federal Government Securities
Non-Government Debt Securities
Foreign exchange contracts
Open ended mutual funds
Operating fixed assets (land \& building) \& NBA

Valuation approach and input used
Marked to Market on the basis of PKRV rates.
Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates.
Marked to Market on the basis of SBP rates.
Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates.
The valuation is based on their assessment of market value of the properties.
