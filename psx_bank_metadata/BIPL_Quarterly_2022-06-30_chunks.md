# Economic Snapshot

Subsequent to June 30, 2022, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised policy rate by 125 bps to take the policy rate to 15%, representing a cumulative increase of 525 bps during last seven months. The hikes in policy rates have largely been part of monetary tightening strategy adopted by an apex authority to ensure soft landing of economy amid uncertain macro and global environment.

On account of removal of energy subsidies, decade high global inflationary indicators and devaluation of Pak Rupee; YoY inflation has mushroomed to 24.9% in July 2022 as opposed to 8.4% in July 2021, with 12 months moving average inflation also increasing to 13.36% in July 2022 versus 8.8% recorded in July 2021. Moreover, owing to increase in global commodity prices and pressure on import bills, FX reserves of the country declined from USD 23.9 Bn in Dec 2021 to USD 15.5 Bn in June 2022. Consequently, USD-PKR parity also weakened to Rs. 239.38 in July 2022 from Rs. 178.17 in Dec 2021 which resulted in restrictions being imposed by regulator on import related outflows.

Nonetheless, as a result of (i) positive development with IMF, (ii) support/commitments from other bilateral partners, and (iii) declining trend in trade deficit, the PKR has gained strength against USD during second week of August with exchange rate falling from Rs. 239.38 to Rs. 215.49.

Despite strict monetary and fiscal stance of our policy makers, inflation is likely to remain on higher side during FY23 (Jul 2022 to Jun 2023) and is forecasted to remain above 18% before declining sharply in FY24.

With current measures being taken by the Government, such as keeping imports under watch, curbing use of energy by means of restricted working hours for commercial markets and planned load shedding of electricity, CA deficit is expected to achieve a narrow level of 3% of GDP in FY23. Nonetheless, actual outcome will primarily remain dependent upon political stability in the country, realization of funds through IMF, enhancement in export proceeds and cooling down of global commodity indices.

The growth in balance sheet during half year ended June 2022 was mainly driven by Deposits, more specifically through growth in Current Account (CA) deposits to underpin improvement in profitability indicators and managing overall cost of funds in the current scenario where benchmark rates have remained on the higher side. Vis-à-vis Dec 2021, total deposits and CA deposits grew by 7.5% and 12.5% respectively in June 2022, with CA mix improving to 40.8% as opposed to 39.0% in Dec 2021. When compared with June 2021, YoY growth in deposits clocked at 21.9% while CA deposits depicted an impressive rise of 31.4%. Going forward, the Bank will continue with its strategy to enhance its overall, particularly CA, deposit base through expanding its branch network, offering competitive Shariah compliant products for both retail and corporate segments and growing its trade based clientele with specific focus towards small and medium sized enterprises.

# Half Yearly Report June 2022

In order to augment the profitability, the Bank channelized its surplus liquidity towards revenue generating avenues such as financing to Corporate, Consumer, Agri & SME segments and treasury placements. As a result Islamic financing (net) of the Bank rose by 15.3% during half year ended June 2022, while treasury placements grew by 48.1%. With the growth in overall Islamic Financing book, NPL ratio of the Bank has reduced from 8.7% in Dec 2021 to 8.1% in June 2022. Owing to current weak economic indicators, the management has taken additional provisioning, due to which the provision coverage ratio (including general provision) enhanced from 89.6% in Dec 2021 to 91.7% in Jun 2022. Keeping in view the current macro-economic scenario and rising trend in policy and inflation rates, the Bank is prudently assessing its credit risk profile and going forward will diligently expand its credit exposures based on its robust risk management framework.

In tandem with rise in policy rates, growth in earning assets and continuous improvement in CA deposits; net spreads earned depicted a healthy growth of 56.3% during half year ended June 2022 as compared to same period last year. Furthermore, non-funded income of the Bank also registered an impressive growth of 62.4% during half year ended June 2022 when compared with same period last year. This was largely due to growth in income earned through digital delivery channels and trade services. Moreover, rise in FX income due to volatility in exchange rate and gains earned on sale of non-banking assets also complemented the overall growth in non-funded income.

Operating expenses of the Bank rose by 22.9% which was mainly attributable to abnormal rise in domestic inflation and FX rates. Increase in operating cost is also due to hiring of staff to foster business growth and rise in variable cost associated with growth in business related transactions. Despite increase in administrative outlays, cost to income ratio of the Bank for the half year ended June 2022 has improved to 57.9% from 76.1% in same period last year.

On account of increase in net spreads and non-funded income, profit before provisioning of the Bank grew by 154.6% to Rs. 4,054 Mn during half year ended June 2022 as compared Rs. 1,592 Mn made during half year ended June 2021. Provisioning against non-performing assets of the Bank depicted an increase of Rs. 1,643 Mn due to booking of additional provisioning to enhance credit risk absorption capacity of the Bank. In line with this, the Bank generated Profit after tax (PAT) amounting to Rs. 1,436 Mn for the half year ended June 2022 i.e. 23.6% higher from PAT of Rs. 1,162 Mn generated during half year ended June 2021, Alhamdulillah.

# Group Results

As at June 30, 2022, total assets and deposits of the Group grew by 12.8% and 7.5% respectively when compared with balances as at December 31, 2021. On account of persistent increase in benchmark rates and the associated repricing of profit bearing assets and liabilities, net spreads earned by the Group improved by 55.7% during half year ended June 2022 versus same period last year. Consequently, overall profitability of the Group has increased by 30.5% and posted a PAT of Rs. 1,446 Mn for the half year ended June 2022 as compared to PAT of Rs. 1,108 generated during same period last year.

# Report on review of Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of BankIslami Pakistan Limited (“the Bank”) as at 30 June 2022 and the related condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed interim unconsolidated cash flow statement, and notes to the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the six-month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements based on our review.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

2.2 The disclosures made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated March 22, 2019 and IAS 34. These condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual unconsolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

2.3 The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through various circulars. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the ICAP and notified by the SECP, vide SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services.

- Effective from 1 January 2024 for all other banks.

However, an option of early adoption of the standard has been made permissible.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Bank are being issued separately.

13.1 The Bank has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 6,107.077 million as at June 30, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Bank would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 2,137.477 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Bank, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realisability of the deferred tax asset.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# Basis of Consolidation

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Holding Company and the financial statements of subsidiary companies from the date that control of the subsidiary by the Holding Company commences until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiary companies, other than those classified as 'Held for Sale' (refer note 15), are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by The Holding Company is eliminated against the corresponding share capital of subsidiaries in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of all material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company, except for non-banking subsidiaries in Pakistan which follow the requirements of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, IAS 40: Investment Property and IFRS - 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which are required to comply with local regulations enforced within the respective jurisdictions.

Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated. Associates are those entities in which the Holding Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Holding Company has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

# 13.1

The Holding Company has aggregate tax losses of bank. 6,107.077 million as at June 30, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Holding Company would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 2,137.477 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Holding Company, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realizability of the deferred tax asset.

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Holding Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:
