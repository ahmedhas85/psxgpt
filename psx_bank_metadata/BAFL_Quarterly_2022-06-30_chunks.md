# Economic Review

The global crisis coming out of covid and economic pitfalls have severely heightened macro-economic uncertainty in many countries, particularly those dependent on imported commodities. Economic activity across the world has slowed as a result of supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, inflationary pressure has surged in many economies as commodity prices escalated, resulting in tightened monetary policies by many central banks.

Global macro-economic instability has taken its toll on the country’s economy resulting in high inflation and an increasing Current Account Deficit. The government has started taking tough fiscal actions in order to secure the IMF deal, which would bear fruit over the next few quarters in the form of stabilized reserves, controlled fiscal balance and sustainable economic growth. However, fast-paced implementation of energy pass-through and fiscal tightening measures are expected to increase the political temperature.

Continued surge in global food & fuel prices, PKR devaluation and energy pass-through resulted in national CPI reaching 21.3% in June 2022, a level which was last witnessed during 2008. Accordingly, FY2021-22 average CPI stands at 12.2% compared to 8.9% last year. Inflation is expected to remain elevated during the next few months with the impact of high energy rates to fully reflect in the CPI, before starting to taper off in the latter half of FY2022-23.

Trade deficit rose from USD 24.8bn in 11MFY21 to USD 36.1bn in 11MFY22 on the back of TERF imports, consumption trends, and rising food and commodity prices. Imports increased 36.5% to USD 65.5bn in 11MFY22 while exports growth was recorded at 26.7%, reaching USD 29.3bn during the same period. Remittances showed modest growth of 6.3% to USD 28.4bn. This translated into a Current Account Deficit of USD 15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of USD 1.2bn in SPLY. Forex reserves fell to USD 16.2bn as of June 24, 2022 vs. USD 23.9bn at end December 2021 and USD 24.4bn at end June 2021. The decline in FX reserves reflects high Current Account Deficit, debt repayments and slow inflows amid delay in the IMF deal. Pak rupee kept depreciating against the US Dollar (23.1% in FY 2022) with the pace accelerating in the last quarter. Responding to the challenges, SBP increased the policy rate by another 125bps to 15.00% in July 2022, taking cumulative monetary tightening to + 8.00% in FY2022.

On the fiscal side, some slippages were witnessed, and the deficit clocked in at 4.0% of GDP during Jul-Mar 2022, compared to 3.6% in SPLY. This was despite 28% tax revenue growth which was used for higher expenditures. Reverting to fiscal adherence in line with IMF guidelines, the Government has presented the FY2022-23 budget with fiscal deficit target of 4.9% for FY 2023 compared to the projected 7% in FY 2022. FBR tax target growth of 23% would be a challenge despite revocation of various tax exemptions/relaxations and imposition of one-time higher super tax. Prudent utilization of tax revenues remains the key to fiscal discipline.

Real GDP growth in FY2022 is projected at ~6.0% (Agri +4.4%, Industrial +7.2% and Services +6.2%), as the cumulative effect of covid-related monetary and fiscal stimuli has contributed towards consumption led growth. However, structural imbalances have caused higher twin deficits, warranting an economic slowdown. For sustainable growth, fiscal discipline remains central and the recently announced Federal Budget FY2023 is a step towards that. Likely revival of IMF program would also help improve market sentiment and FX flows while keeping fiscal discipline in check. The recent downtrend in some commodity prices is also a welcome sign and if sustained, would significantly improve the country’s external account position and offer respite on the fiscal front.

Pakistan benchmark KSE-100 index fell 7.5% during 4Q FY2022, taking total return to negative 12.3% in FY2022 as a result of deteriorating global and local macro-economic indicators.

The new government is working hard for economic reformation and to improve Pakistan’s credibility in the international market, which remains imperative. The country needs to scale back both its imports and expenditures and manage the economic situation. Efforts in this direction are underway and will hopefully soon bear fruit. Short-term measures can be helpful for Pakistan, but it’s time to look for long-term solutions too.

| Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share – Rupees | 4.90            | 3.90            |

Bank Alfalah delivered outstanding financial results in the first half of 2022, with record profit before and after-tax growth of 50.9% and 25.5% respectively. PAT growth was impacted by one-time super tax imposed by the Federal Government. The Earning Per Share (EPS) is Rs. 4.90 (Jun 2021: Rs. 3.90).

Amidst challenging market fundamentals, rising inflation, political and economic uncertainty, the bank’s performance was strong in 2022. The bank remained focused on executing its long-term strategy to increase market share and become the largest transaction bank with customer centricity at the forefront.

The revenue increased by 43.7% as compared to the same period last year (SPLY). Markup income grew significantly by 45.6%; the increase in markup income is driven by a combination of solid growth in net earning assets and re-pricing of the asset book which was well positioned to take advantage of rising interest rates. Non-markup income stood at Rs. 10.901 billion, higher by 38.4% from SPLY; growth was visible in all non-fund-based income lines with the exception of capital gains due to rapid increase in the discount rate by the central bank to curb inflation. FX income doubled on the back of better trade and remittance volumes. Our Fee and commission income showed a robust growth of 33.9% year on year (YoY). Combined debit and credit card spend was up by 71% and new card sales increased by 31%. We continue to outpace the industry in home remittance with our market share reaching around 19%. Trade and guarantee commission increased on the back of significant volumetric growth. Income from Alternate Delivery Channels improved by 94% YoY, due to significant increase in ADC transaction volume and resumption of charges on interbank fund transfers. Consumer lending remained strong, YoY outstanding up by 44%. BAFL continues to play a leading role under Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) scheme and is the first bank to achieve Rs. 8.0 Bn disbursement milestone. We were able to meet construction finance target set by SBP for all quarters enabling us to avail incentive of lower cash reserve requirement (CRR). Higher disbursements of Government Ehsaas Funds and higher Banca business during the quarter further supported the growth in the fee income lines.

The Bank continues to keep a check on expenses and manage costs prudently while focusing on building revenue momentum through expansion without compromising on investments in new ventures. The impact of new branches, investment in digital technologies, professional consultancies, PKR depreciation and inflation related effects led to an increase in operating expenses of 24.8%. In the last two years, we opened 141 new branches across Pakistan, which are helping us in deposit mobilization and revenue growth. The bank is also investing in digital technologies with a focus on areas where we can deepen our relationships and gain market share. The best evidence of that success is our market share growth over the last two and a half years. The bank’s cost to income ratio improved to 50.4% as against 58.0% SPLY, taking support from strong revenue growth.

The bank’s deposits closed at Rs. 1.318 trillion at the end of Q2’22, with YoY growth of 28.6%. We continue to outpace the industry in total deposits growth. The current accounts grew by 25.7% YoY. CA mix improved to 45.5% versus 44.0% SPLY.

# Bank Alfalah



The bank grew loans by 18.3% YoY, while maintaining credit discipline. The growth is reﬂective of the Bank’s strategy to capitalize on consumer ﬁnance, SME lending and penetration in digital lending space. As at the half year end, our gross advances to deposits ratio stood at 57.3%, much higher than 50% on which higher income tax rate becomes applicable. Despite challenging market fundamentals, the bank’s credit performance was quite strong in the first half of 2022. Our consistent underwriting discipline and rigorous client selection continued to serve us well, and we are prepared for a range of potential economic outcomes. The Bank’s non-performing loans ratio stood at 3.5%, while the non-performing loans remain fully covered through provisions which include provision held against subjectively classiﬁed loans and general provision against Covid restructured loans and certain high-risk portfolio.

As at June 30, 2022, the bank remains adequately capitalised with CAR at 14.64%.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on July 28, 2022, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 2.50 per share (25%) (2021: Rs. 2 per share; 20%) for the half year ended June 30, 2022.

# REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Bank Alfalah Limited (the Bank) as at 30 June 2022 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, and notes to the accounts for the six-months’ period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “unconsolidated interim financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unconsolidated interim financial statements in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements based on our review. The figures of the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income for the three months ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 have not been reviewed, as we are required to review only the cumulative figures for the six months period ended 30 June 2022.

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity." A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unconsolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 35.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

- (a) Financial instruments in level 1
Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and listed non-government debt securities.
- (b) Financial instruments in level 2
Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts and interest rate swaps.
- (c) Financial instruments in level 3
Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3 except as disclosed in 35.3.2. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS

Bank Alfalah maintains a two branch presence in Afghanistan. The board and management of the Bank continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to country's frozen reserves and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The bank remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.

# 36 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
