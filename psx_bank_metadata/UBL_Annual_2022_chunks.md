# LEADING THE WAY IN DIGITAL REVOLUTION

Since inception in 1959, UBL has gradually evolved into Pakistan’s leading financial institution. Just like a butterfly’s metamorphosis from a caterpillar to an adult, a bank can also evolve over time as it adapts to changes in the market and the needs of its customers. Similar to the butterfly's transformation, this process can involve gradual changes to the bank's organisational structure, operations, products and services offered to the customers.

The butterfly emerges from the cocoon with wings, colorful patterns, and other adaptations that enable it to survive and reproduce in its environment. UBL has evolved from purely a traditional brick-and-mortar model to one that is in the metaverse, with the development of new digital technologies and changes in consumer behavior.

With careful planning, strategic investments and the willingness to adapt to change, UBL has shed its cocoon with a new set of capabilities and strengths to thrive in its environment.

# DIRECTORS’ REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS 2022

am elated to announce that has been another remarkable year for United Bank Limited (UBL) as the Bank continues to expand its profitability levels. As Chairman of the Board of one of the largest financial institutions of Pakistan, I would like to express my gratitude towards our ever-increasing customer base, who continue to place their faith in our organisation. As we continue in our journey towards being a world class bank dedicated to excellence and to surpass the highest expectation of our customers, I would like to appreciate the management as well as our invaluable UBL family who maintain the highest level of professionalism and commitment towards serving our customers.

The core foundation of UBL franchise remains its domestic operations. We will continue to invest in our network, our people and our technological infrastructure, to widen our digital product suite and further improve our customer service standards. The Bank has stabilised its international businesses as we look to build a more profitable and sustainable business model for the longer term. The international branches posted a healthy contribution to the Bank’s bottom line in 2022 and we believe that the business will continue to be a strong diversification benefit to the UBL franchise. We maintain a strong relationship with the Pakistani diaspora all over the world who continue to regard UBL as their bank of choice, as we maintained our market leadership position in the home remittances space.

The Bank continues to work closely with the regulators and is actively participating in all major nation building initiatives to strengthen the economy and expand the scope of financial services across the country. We are an active participant in housing schemes, providing access to loans to the country’s youth, as well as playing a major role in mobilising foreign currency under the very successful Roshan Digital initiative of the Government of Pakistan.

The Bank adheres to the highest standards of corporate governance in line with regulatory guidelines and international best practices. The Board has constituted various sub-committees with a comprehensive oversight framework for governance across risk management, audit, information technology and other key functions necessary for achieving the Bank’s strategic objectives. I would like to mention that the Board and its sub-committees have carried out their responsibilities with the highest levels of competence, professionalism, proficiency and in accordance with their respective terms of reference.

United Bank Limited Annual Report 2022



PRESIDENT AND CEO REVIEW 2022

Tightening of monetary policy and financial conditions have continued to work through the economy to suppress inflation. The year has witnessed a high interest rate regime as policy rate was raised by a total of 5 bps in 2022 and by another 1 bps in January 2023 pushing the interest rate to 17% as inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent. The impact of the catastrophic flooding events that occurred in 2022 will continue to be felt this year as well. As the country struggles with foreign exchange pressures, the resumption of the program and bilateral flows have become critical. Even though it will take time to regain financial stability and spur economic activity, the adjustments required for recovery have already begun.

We have had another excellent year and upheld our leadership position as Pakistan’s most progressive and innovative Bank, winning global and local industry awards from Euromoney, Asiamoney, Society Pakistan and Pakistan Digital Awards. Reflecting upon our journey this past year, we are proud of what we have achieved and are extremely thankful to the UBL Team, our customers and our shareholders. In 2022, our focus was on building a stronger and more sustainable bank for the future. This included the investments we made in our state-of-the-art technology platforms and especially in our human capital.

# Challenges and Outlook

The global economy faced significant challenges with high inflation levels, climate change consequences and the continuation of war in Ukraine all being major contributors. Steady and lengthening inflation pressures triggered a powerful wave of US dollar appreciation against most currencies. Despite the tough macro-economic environment, UBL has continued to build on its award-winning digital banking infrastructure which has repeatedly been recognized as one of the best in Pakistan in providing the most innovative banking solutions by winning global and local industry awards.

# Conclusion

We remain a Strategic Partner to the Nation as a Leader in Home Remittances. Remittance inflows to Pakistan remained under pressure throughout 2022 which is primarily due to high global inflation, appreciation of the dollar and more recently the prevailing disparity in the official and market exchange rates. Despite that, UBL grew transactions and volume resulting in a 1% increase in market share to 11.5%. Various factors fostered this positive growth including increased penetration in US, UK, UAE corridors and unrelenting efforts for continuous improvement of service delivery.

# Core Sustainable Business Model

It was a challenging year for the international operations due to rising interest rates post Covid and amid the Russia Ukraine war. The overseas average deposit remained steady at US $1 billion. The Bank, in line with its strategy to exit non-core markets, has closed operations in Yemen and subsidiaries in Tanzania and Switzerland have been wound down. This was part of the proactive de-risking strategy adopted since the last years and is reflecting positive results for the International business.

# Complaint Management Overview

UBL enhanced its complaint handling system and shared awareness about its complaint lodging process through bankwide communications and trainings. Further, the Bank encouraged its customers to approach external dispute resolution forums - Banking Mohtasib Pakistan - if they are not satisfied with the complaint resolution provided by UBL.

Complaint Management Unit is also synchronised with their core departments for reduction in customer grievances and observed decrease in complaint volume in 2022 by facilitating customers. Complaints trend and closure analysis reports are also shared with the Board Members, Senior Management, and Business owners. Based on these findings, remedial measures are taken.

UBL regards complaints as an important feedback for improvement. With management view on catering to the needs of customers, Fair Treatment Customer Service Committee (FTCSC) exists to foresee customer issues and provides advice to enhance customer experience.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF UNITED BANK LIMITED

Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies Code of Corporate Governance Regulations, 2019 prepared by the Board of Directors of United Bank Limited (the Bank) for the year ended December 31, in accordance with the requirements of regulation 11 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. Our review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, .

United Bank Limited Annual Report 2022


ANNUAL STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 2022

15. The Board has set up an effective internal audit function who are considered suitably qualified and experienced for the purpose and are conversant with the policies and procedures of the Bank.

1. The statutory auditors of the Bank have confirmed that they have been given a satisfactory rating under the quality control review program of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan and registered with Audit Oversight Board of Pakistan, that they and all their partners are in compliance with International Federation of Accountants guidelines on code of ethics as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan and that they and the partners of the firm involved in the audit are not a close relative spouse, parent, dependent and non-dependent children of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Internal Audit, Company Secretary or Director of the Bank.

The statutory auditors or the persons associated with them have not been appointed to provide other services except in accordance with the Act, these regulations or any other regulatory requirement and the auditors have confirmed that they have observed guidelines in this regard.

1. We confirm that all requirements of regulations, and of the regulations have been complied with and explanation for non-compliance with requirements, other than regulations, are below if applicable.

The Internal Control System comprises of various inter-related components including the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information communication and monitoring. The Audit Risk Review Group continued to perform audit and review activities to evaluate the implementation of controls and ensure the existence of a healthy control environment throughout the Bank. During the period, Audit Risk Review Group has performed various offsite reviews particularly, keeping in view of rapidly changing economic environment and consulting engagements considering the emerging threats and assessing the management responsiveness to provide insights on overall governance, evolving risks, business disruption and embedded controls for enhancing the overall control environment.

It is the responsibility of the Bank’s management to establish an Internal Control System to maintain an adequate and effective internal control environment. An Internal Control System is a set of processes designed to identify and mitigate the risk of failure and achieve overall business objectives of the Bank.

Internal controls and policies are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s operations, reliability of financial information and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. All significant and material findings of the internal external auditors and regulators were addressed on a priority basis by the management and their status was reported periodically to the Board Audit Committee and Risk Compliance Committee, which ensured that management has taken appropriate corrective actions and has put in place a system to minimize repetition to ensure strengthening of the control environment.

The Bank endeavors to follow the State Bank of Pakistan’s guidelines on internal controls. The Bank is continuously making efforts to ensure that an effective and efficient internal control System remains active and implemented through consistent continuous monitoring that would help in further improving the overall control environment. As part of this exercise, the Bank has documented a comprehensive governance framework which has been approved by the Board of Directors.

The Bank’s Internal Control System has been designed to provide reasonable assurance to the shareholders and Board of Directors however, these systems may not entirely eliminate the risk of misreporting and failure of certain controls under a changing environment.

Evaluation of the Bank’s Internal Control System comprises of different levels of monitoring activities i.e. Line Management, Compliance Group, Internal Control over Financial Reporting Unit and Audit Risk Review Group. Line Management’s role has been enhanced to include onsite reviews of processes in branches to identify gaps in execution with special emphasis on the implementation of regulatory instructions in addition to day to day monitoring of control breaches for prompt corrective actions.

In order to improve the oversight on compliance with regulatory requirements and quality financial crime compliance, regional compliance business managers have been placed in each Branch Banking region. Further, keeping in view the changing risk environment and Bank’s increased focus on controls and compliance matters, an Internal Control Division is operating within Operations Group for monitoring branch related operations.

Based upon the results achieved from reviews and audits conducted by Line Management, Compliance Group, Internal Control Division, Unit and Audit Risk Review Group during the year, management considers that the existing Internal Control System is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored, though room for improvement always exists.

| 1. Expected credit loss (ECL) / impairment provision against investment in foreign currency sovereign bonds | The Bank’s investment portfolio includes a gross carrying value (before provisions) of Rs. 152,272 million in respect of investments in sovereign bonds denominated in foreign currencies that are issued by Pakistan and other countries. These include sovereign bonds with defaulted status as well as other bonds with varying credit ratings. During the year, the Bank has made an aggregate impairment provisions / ECL provisions amounting to Rs. 10,366 million in respect of the above portfolio of investments. Due to the significance of the events impacting the sovereign bonds portfolio, particularly the defaults and deterioration of credit ratings, together with the judgements and estimates involved in determining the impairment / ECL provisions, we have considered this area as a Key Audit Matter. We applied a range of audit procedures including the following:- We obtained an understanding of the accounting policies and the impairment framework used by the Bank for determining impairment / ECL provisions against this portfolio.
- We assessed ECL methodologies implemented by the Bank in relation to this portfolio by reference to the requirements of IFRS 9. In this regard, we focused on the sources of information underlying the credit ratings and Probability of default assumptions, together with consistency in the application of ECL model.
- In respect of defaulted sovereign bonds, we considered the publicly available information about the issuer’s economic and financial conditions, observed market prices for the relevant bonds and the impairment computations made by the management.
- We have performed procedures on test basis for the computations of provisions to assess that the same is in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations.
- In addition, we selected a representative sample of borrowers from the advances portfolios including individually significant credit facilities and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Bank and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 4.4 and 9 respectively to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing advances and provisions made for the same in the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |
| 2. Provision against Non Performing advances                                                                | The Bank’s advances portfolio represents 33.40% of its total assets as of 31 December 2022. A substantial portion of the advances portfolio includes loans and advances to businesses operating in diverse sectors of the economy. As per the Bank’s accounting policy (refer note 4.4 to the unconsolidated financial statements), the Bank determines provisions against non-performing advances exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning for loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Bank’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision therefore involves use of management judgment, on a case to case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviour and realizability of collateral held by the Bank. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the unconsolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of provision against advances as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter. The accounting policy and disclosures relating to provisioning against non-performing advances are included in note 4.4 and 9 respectively to the unconsolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

# The Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

# 2.3.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

As per SBP BPRD Circular No 3 of 2022, the effective date for the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is accounting period beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As part of the same circular, SBP has issued detailed instructions on the application of the Standard, including transitional provisions, impact on the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) calculation and reporting requirements. The SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions apply to both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of the Bank. However, the financial statements of overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates that are prepared for the purpose of consolidation at Bank level would be based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices till one year from the effective date of IFRS 9 implementation. Afterwards, banks are required to comply with the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP’s application instructions for consolidated financial statements.

The IFRS 9 application instructions and guidelines that have been issued as part of the circular include the following key components:

- Basis for classification and measurement of debt and equity securities;
- Framework for determination of “Expected Credit Losses (ECL)” under the requirements of IFRS 9, including required risk management policies;
- Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities have been exempted from the application of the above ECL Framework;
- In respect of non-preforming exposures (Stage 3 exposures) provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements;
- In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital and fully described in Annexure B to the aforementioned circular.

The State Bank of Pakistan vide its BPRD circular No. 2 dated February 9, 2023 has issued revised formats for interim and annual financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from January 01, 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures on adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

# Impact on equity and regulatory capital on adoption of IFRS 9

During 2022, the Bank has performed an impact assessment after applying the SBP’s IFRS 9 instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9.

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by IFRS-9, the Bank will not be restating comparatives on initial application. The cumulative impact of the initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to opening equity as at January 1, 2023. The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity as at 1 January 2023 would be a reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 634.873 million, with corresponding impacts as follows:

- A decrease of approximately Rs. 2,019.031 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of approximately Rs. 1,384.158 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply this transitional arrangement, may implement this in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR purposes as mentioned in Annexure-B of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

The estimated impact of initial adoption of IFRS 9 on the Bank’s capital ratios, without accounting for the allowed transitional arrangement, would be as follows:

- Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio - 14.08%
- Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio - 15.12%
- Total Capital Adequacy Ratio - 20.16%

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime to the extent of the Bank's domestic operations, whereas the requirements of this standard have been incorporated for the overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has already been adopted.

There are certain other new amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and are, therefore, not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3.2 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

1. classification and valuation of investments (notes 4.3 and 8).
2. provision against non-performing advances (notes 4.4 and 9.4).
3. income taxes (notes 4.10 and 33).
4. defined benefit plans (notes 4.12 and 37).
5. fair value of derivatives (note 4.17.2).
6. valuation and depreciation of fixed assets (notes 4.5 and 10).
7. valuation and amortisation of intangible assets (note 4.7 and 11).
8. valuation of right-of-use assets and their related lease liability (notes 4.6 and 10).
9. impairment (note 4.9).
10. valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.8).

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

During the year, the Bank has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated profit and loss account from the current year.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

# 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 4.1 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement consist of cash and balances with treasury banks and balances with other banks.

# 4.3.1  Initial measurement

All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investment. Regular way purchases or sales of investments require delivery within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Investments are initially recognised at fair value which, in the case of investments other than held for trading, includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Transaction costs on investments held for trading are expensed as incurred.

# 4.3.2  Subsequent measurement

# Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the profit and loss account.

# Held to maturity

These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.

# Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus or deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position as part of the equity and is taken to the profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. A decline in the carrying value is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

# 4.3.3  Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates

Investments in subsidiaries and associates are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Gains and losses on disposal of investments in subsidiaries and associates are included in the profit and loss account.

# 4.4    Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions which are charged to the profit and loss account. Provision against advances by the Bank's branches in Pakistan is determined on the basis of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP. Provision against advances by the Bank's overseas branches are made in accordance with the requirements of the financial reporting regime of the respective countries in which the overseas branches operate. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. The amount so written-off is a book entry and does not necessarily prejudice the Bank's right of recovery against the customer.

# 4.4.2  Islamic financings and related assets

Receivables under Murabaha financing represent cost price plus an agreed profit on deferred sale arrangement. Profit could be recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the instalments.

Ijarah financing represents arrangements whereby the Bank (being the owner of assets) transfers its usufruct to its customers for an agreed period at an agreed consideration (rentals). Assets leased out under Ijarah are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are depreciated over the term of the lease. Ijarah income is recognised on an accrual basis.

Diminishing Musharakah is partnership agreement between the Bank and its customer for long term financing of assets. The receivable is recorded to the extent of Bank's share in the purchase of asset. Income is recognised on accrual basis.

Istisna is a sale contract where the Bank places an order to the manufacturer / builders to produce certain assets and the sale is completed upon the delivery of the assets to the ultimate buyer.

Running Musharakah facility is to finance the working capital requirement of the customer whereas partnership is based on particular operations of the business.

# 4.5     Fixed assets

Property and equipment, other than land (which is not depreciated) and capital work-in-progress, are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less impairment losses while capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses. The cost and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment of overseas branches include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. A decrease arising on revaluation of fixed assets is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Gains and losses on sale of fixed assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Major renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of an asset are capitalized and the assets so replaced, if any, are retired. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred.

# 4.6     Lease liability and Right-of-use asset

The bank enters into leasing arrangements for its branches, ATMs and warehouses. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options as described below. At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not be terminated).

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Bank's incremental borrowing rate.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the Bank under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The extension and termination options are incorporated in determination of lease term only when the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise these options.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification. The lease liability is remeasured when the Bank reassesses the reasonable certainty of exercise of extension or termination option upon occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstance, or when there is a change in assessment of an option to purchase underlying asset, or when there is a change in amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payment. The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-to-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of right-to-use asset has been reduced to zero.

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The Bank has elected to apply the practical expedient not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The lease payments associated with these leases is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

# 4.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost and the accumulated amortisation of intangible assets of overseas branches include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange. Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the amortizable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 11.1 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The amortisation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. Amortisation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No amortisation is charged in the month of disposal. Gains and losses on sale of intangible assets are included in the profit and loss account.

# 4.8 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account. A decrease arising on revaluation of non-banking asset is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

All direct costs of acquiring title to asset are charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on sale of non-banking assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.9 Impairment

Impairment of available for sale equity investments

Available for sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

Impairment of debt investments

Provisions for diminution in the value of debt securities are made as per the criteria prescribed by the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. Provision against debt investments by the Bank's overseas branches is made as per the requirements of the respective regulatory regimes in which the overseas branches operate.

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates

The Bank considers that a decline in the recoverable value of the investment in a subsidiary or an associate below its cost may be evidence of impairment. Recoverable value is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value falls below the carrying value and is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary or the associate, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.10 Taxation

Current

Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws and at the prevailing rates for taxation on income earned by the Bank for local as well as overseas operations. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method on all major temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. The Bank also recognizes deferred tax asset / liability on the deficit / surplus on revaluation of fixed assets / non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims and securities which is adjusted against the related deficit / surplus in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12, Income Taxes.

# 4.11 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

Provision for off balance sheet obligations is recognised when intimated and reasonable certainty exists that the Bank will be required to settle the obligation. The provision is charged to the profit and loss account net of expected recovery and the obligation is classified under other liabilities. Provisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 9.4.2 General provision represents provision amounting to Rs. 469.159 million (2021: Rs. 402.418 million) against consumer finance portfolio as required by the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP and Rs. 9,337.641 million (2021: Rs. 6,990.843 million) pertaining to overseas advances to meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries in which the overseas branches operate. In addition, bank has created a general charge on agriculture finance portfolio of Rs. 300.000 million (2021: Nil).

# 9.4.3 The Bank has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of certain mortgaged properties held as collateral against non-performing advances as allowed under BSD Circular 1 of 2011. Had the benefit under the said circular not been taken by the Bank, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 5.359 million (2021: Rs. 16.258 million).

# 9.5 These represent non-performing advances for agriculture finance which have been classified as loss, are fully provided and are in default for more than 3 years. These non-performing advances have been charged off by extinguishing them against the provision held in accordance with the SBP's Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing. This charge off does not, in any way, prejudice the Bank's right of recovery from these customers.

# 20.3

In 2007, the Bank was admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange Professional Securities Market for trading of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), each representing four ordinary shares issued by the Bank. The GDRs constitute an offering in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S Securities Act of 1933 and an offering outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Holders of GDRs are entitled, subject to the provisions of the depository agreement, to receive dividends, if any, and rank pari passu with other equity shareholders in respect of such entitlement. However, the holders of GDRs have no voting rights or other direct rights of shareholders with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such GDRs. Subject to the terms and restrictions set out in the offering circular dated June 25, 2007, the deposited ordinary shares in respect of which the GDRs were issued may be withdrawn by the GDR holders from the depository facility. Upon withdrawal, the holders will rank pari passu with other ordinary shareholders in respect of voting powers. As at December 31, 2022, 242,278 (2021: 242,278) GDRs, representing 969,112 (2021: 969,112) shares are in issue.

# 40. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 40.1 The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# 45.2 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty may not settle an obligation for full value, either when due or at any time thereafter. This risk arises from the potential that a customer's or counterparty’s willingness or ability to meet such an obligation is impaired, resulting in an economic loss to the Bank.

The credit risk management process is driven by the Bank's Risk Management Policy, Credit Policy for domestic operations, Collateral Management Policy, Credit Policy of respective overseas operation, which provide guidance in relation to credit initiation, approval, documentation and disbursement, credit maintenance and remedial management process.

Individual credit authorities are delegated to credit officers by the Group Executive - Risk & Credit Policy (authorized by BoD), according to their seasoning / maturity. Approvals for Consumer loans are centralized, while approval authorities for overseas operations, Corporate, Commercial, SME and Agri exposures are delegated at a Country / Regional level. Furthermore, credit authorities are also delegated to business teams in various regions for Commercial, SME & Agri lending. All credit policy functions globally are centrally organized. The bank is at an advanced stage of automating the credit initiation and approval work flow. Domestic Corporate portfolio has achieved Go-Live status on Dec 28, 2022.

# 45.3.4 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) - Basel II Specific

Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Interest rate risk is inherent in the overall business of the Bank and arises from mismatches between the contractual maturities and the re-pricing of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. In case of any distressed event the results and corresponding action plan is presented at the relevant management / BoD committee.

This unit remains responsible for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information / cyber security management system through control design and controls validation, primarily in the domain of applications / network penetration testing, and also supporting the other domains of information security i.e., security monitoring and threat hunting.

Moreover, to overcome social engineering frauds, extensive awareness campaigns are launched to provide specific training and guidance on information security related matters such as phishing, identity theft, online transaction frauds, etc. through various mechanisms such as social media, website, email advisories, SMS, webinars, phishing simulation exercises, new joiner’s orientation, and targeted awareness sessions for executive leadership. These initiatives by Governance, Risk and Compliance Unit are focused on elevating level of awareness for both internal as well as external customers to better equip them to counter security challenges.

This unit manages the security compliance efforts, risk management and the development and implementation of information security policies, procedures, guidelines and standards. Cyber & Infrastructure Security unit ensures that the IT Infrastructure function and services are resilient, secure, well-designed, accessible, and adaptable to the organization's changing demands. This unit is responsible for the continuous improvement of information / cyber security architecture that protects against both internal and external threats.

Significant progress has been made in securing the international territories as well by deploying 24/7 Security Operation Center (SOC) at UBL. This unit deals with security issues. The unit continuously shares awareness news, alerts, announcements, advisories and threats intelligence research reports to relevant stakeholder for securing the bank’s assets.

Application Security in Information security (IS) manages IS Risk Analysis on software applications, APIs, Mobile Apps, Digital Channels, Cloud Computing, ATM including review of security aspects of assets, enterprise architecture design controls of the applications in accordance with applicable policies, standards & controls.

Further, The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) program was initiated which aims to enhance security for customer card data by setting guidelines for any company that accepts, stores, processes, or transmits card information.

Credit risk refers to the risk of non-performance or default by a party to a derivatives transaction, resulting in an adverse impact on the Bank’s profitability.

# Market risk

The Bank, as a policy, hedges back-to-back all options transactions. In addition, the Bank does not carry any exchange risk on its Cross Currency Swaps portfolio as it hedges the exposure in the interbank market. To manage the interest rate risk of Interest Rate Derivatives, the Bank has implemented various limits which are monitored and reported by TMO on a daily basis.

# Liquidity risk

Derivatives transactions, usually being non-funded in nature, do not carry a specific funding liquidity risk. The liquidity risk arises from the fact that in Pakistan, interest rate derivatives generally have a uni-directional demand, and no perfect hedge is available. The Bank mitigates its risk by limiting the portfolio in terms of tenor, notional and sensitivity limits, and can also hedge its risk by taking on and off balance sheet positions in the interbank market, where available.

# Operational risk

The staff involved in the trading, settlement and risk management of derivatives is carefully trained to deal with the complexities involved in the process. Adequate systems and controls are in place to carry out derivatives transactions smoothly. Each transaction is processed in accordance with the product program or a transaction memo, which contains detailed guidance on the accounting and operational aspects of the transaction to further mitigate operational risk. In addition, TMO and the Compliance and Control Department are assigned the responsibility of monitoring any deviation from policies and procedures. The Bank’s Audit and Inspection Group also reviews this function, with a regular review of systems, transactional processes, accounting practices and end-user roles and responsibilities.

# 46. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana’a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank’s control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

| 1. Expected credit loss (ECL) / impairment provision against investment in foreign currency sovereign bonds | The Group’s investment portfolio includes a gross carrying value (before provisions) of Rs. 189,457 million in respect of investments in sovereign bonds denominated in foreign currencies that are issued by Pakistan and other countries. These include sovereign bonds with defaulted status as well as other bonds with varying credit ratings. We applied the following key audit procedures in respect of impairment / ECL provisions for foreign currency sovereign bonds portfolio:- We obtained an understanding of the accounting policies and the impairment framework used by the Group for determining impairment/ECL provisions against this portfolio.
- We assessed ECL methodologies implemented by the Group in relation to this portfolio by reference to the requirements of IFRS 9. In this regard, we focused on the sources of information underlying the credit ratings and Probability of default assumptions, together with consistency in the application of ECL model.
- In respect of defaulted sovereign bonds, we considered the publicly available information about the issuer’s economic and financial conditions, observed market prices for the relevant bonds and the impairment computations made by the management.
- We also discussed, with the auditors of the overseas operations / subsidiary regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of impairment / ECL provisions, made by the Group.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 8.3.1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing investments and provisions made for the same in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2. Provision against Non Performing advances                                                                | The Group’s advances portfolio represents 36.81% of its total assets as of 31 December 2022. A substantial portion of the advances portfolio includes loans and advances to businesses operating in diverse sectors of the economy. As per the Group’s accounting policy (refer note 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements), the Group determines provisions against non-performing advances exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning for loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Group’s credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision therefore involves use of management judgment, on a case to case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviour and realizability of collateral held by the Group. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the consolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified adequacy and completeness of provision against advances as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter.- We performed procedures on test basis for the computations of provisions to assess that the same is in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations.
- In addition, we selected a representative sample of borrowers from the advances portfolios including individually significant credit facilities and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status, financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ financial statements, nature of collateral held by the Group and status of litigation, if any, with the borrower.
- We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing advances and provisions made for the same in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. |

| Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8                                                                 | January 01, 2023                                      |
| Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2                                    | January 01, 2023                                      |
| Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 12                  | January 01, 2023                                      |
| Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - Amendments to IFRS 16                                                          | January 01, 2024                                      |

During 2022, the Bank has performed an impact assessment after applying the SBP’s IFRS 9 instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9.

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by IFRS-9, the Bank will not be restating comparatives on initial application. The cumulative impact of the initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to opening equity as at January 1, 2023.

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Group's equity as at 1 January 2023 would be a reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 634.873 million, with corresponding impacts as follows:

- a) A decrease of approximately Rs. 2,019.031 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- b) An increase of approximately Rs. 1,384.158 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply this transitional arrangement, may implement this in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR purposes as mentioned in Annexure-B of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022.

# 3.2 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) classification and valuation of investments (notes 4.4 and 8)
- ii) provision against non-performing advances (notes 4.5 and 9.4)
- iii) income taxes (notes 4.11 and 36)
- iv) defined benefit plans (notes 4.13 and 40)
- v) fair value of derivatives (note 4.18.2)
- vi) valuation and depreciation of fixed assets (notes 4.6 and 10)
- vii) valuation and amortisation of intangible assets (notes 4.8 and 11)
- viii) valuation of right-of-use assets and their related lease liability (notes 4.7 and 10)
- ix) impairment (note 4.10)
- x) valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (note 4.9)

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. During the year, the Bank has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the consolidated profit and loss account from the current year.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

# 4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year.

# 4.1 Basis of consolidation

# 4.1.1 Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies. All subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date that control ceases.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are consistent with those of the Holding Company, except for non-banking subsidiaries in Pakistan which follow the requirements of IFRS 9 and IAS 40, and overseas subsidiaries which are required to comply with local regulations enforced within the respective jurisdictions.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The Group recognises non-controlling interests (NCI) in subsidiaries at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets. NCI in the equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of changes in equity.

# 4.4.1 Initial measurement

All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the investment. Regular way purchases or sales require delivery of investments within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Investments are initially recognised at fair value which, in the case of investments other than held for trading, includes transaction costs associated with the investments. Transaction costs on investments held for trading are expensed as incurred.

# 4.4.2 Subsequent measurement

# Held for trading

These are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the profit and loss account.

# Held to maturity

# Available for sale

Quoted securities classified as available for sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Any surplus / deficit arising thereon is kept in a separate account shown in the statement of financial position as part of equity and is taken to the profit and loss account when realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired.

Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. The break-up value of these securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. A decline in the carrying value is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent increase in the carrying value, up to the cost of the investment, is credited to the profit and loss account. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment, if any.

# 4.5 Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions which are charged to the profit and loss account. Specific provisions against domestic advances and general provision against domestic consumer loans portfolio are determined on the basis of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP. Provisions against advances pertaining to overseas branches and subsidiaries are made in accordance with the requirements of the financial reporting regime of the respective countries in which the overseas branches and subsidiaries operate.

Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. The amount so written off is a book entry and does not necessarily prejudice to the Group's right of recovery against the customer.

# 4.6 Fixed assets

Property and equipment, other than land (which is not depreciated) and capital work-in-progress, are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less impairment losses while capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less impairment losses. The cost and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment of overseas branches and subsidiaries include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the depreciable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 10.2 to these consolidated financial statements. The depreciation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No depreciation is charged in the month of disposal.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. A decrease arising on revaluation of fixed assets is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit. Gains and losses on sale of fixed assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Major renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of an asset are capitalised and the assets so replaced, if any, are retired. Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as and when incurred.

# 4.7 Lease liability and Right-of-use asset

The Group enters into leasing arrangements for its branches, ATMs and warehouses. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options as described below. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not be terminated).

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The extension and termination options are incorporated in determination of lease term only when the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these options.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group reassesses the reasonable certainty of exercise of extension or termination option upon occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstance, or when there is a change in assessment of an option to purchase underlying asset, or when there is a change in amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payment. The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-to-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of right-to-use asset has been reduced to zero.

On initial recognition, right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The lease payments associated with these leases is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

# 4.8 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost and the accumulated amortisation of intangible assets of overseas branches and subsidiaries include exchange differences arising on currency translation at the year-end rates of exchange. Amortisation is calculated so as to write-off the amortisable amount of the assets over their expected useful lives at the rates specified in note 11.1 to these consolidated financial statements. The amortisation charge for the year is calculated on a straight line basis after taking into account the residual value, if any. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. Amortisation on additions is charged from the month the asset is available for use. No amortisation is charged in the month of disposal.

Gains and losses on sale of intangible assets are included in the profit and loss account.

# 4.9 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account. A decrease arising on revaluation of non-banking asset is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

All direct costs of acquiring title to asset are charged to the profit and loss account. Gains and losses on sale of non-banking assets are included in the profit and loss account, except that the related surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.10 Impairment

Impairment of available for sale equity investments

Available for sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below their cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. A subsequent increase in the fair value of a previously impaired listed equity security is recorded in the statement of financial position in the surplus / deficit on revaluation of securities account and only recorded through the profit and loss account when realised on disposal.

Impairment of debt investments

Provisions for diminution in the value of debt securities are made as per the criteria prescribed by the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. Provision against debt investments by the Group's overseas branches and subsidiaries is made as per the requirements of the respective regulatory regimes in which the overseas branches and subsidiaries operate.

Impairment of investments in associates

The Group considers that a decline in the recoverable value of the investment in an associate below its cost may be evidence of impairment. Recoverable value is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable value falls below the carrying value and is charged to the profit and loss account. A subsequent reversal of an impairment loss, up to the cost of the investment in the associate, is credited to the profit and loss account.

# 4.11 Taxation

Current Provision for current taxation is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws and at the prevailing rates for taxation on income earned by the Group for local as well as overseas operations. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method on all major temporary differences between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the period when the differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

The Group also recognises deferred tax asset / liability on the deficit / surplus on revaluation of fixed assets / non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims and securities which is adjusted against the related deficit / surplus in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12, Income Taxes.

# 40.13 Funding Policy

The Bank endeavours to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date, based on various actuarial assumptions.

# 40.14 The significant risks associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes are as follows:

# Asset Volatility

The risk arises due to inclusion of risky assets in the funds portfolio, inflation and interest rate volatility.

# Changes in Bond Yields

The risk arises when bond yield is lower than the expected return on the planned assets (duration based PIB discount rate).

# Inflation Risk

The salary inflation is the major risk that the Gratuity and Compensated Absences liability carries. In pension fund the increase has been determined by the Supreme Court and does not carry this risk as the benefit is practically no longer exposed to future salary increases. Some of the post-retirement medical benefits are capped to a proportion of Pension, thus carrying no salary inflation risk. However, the hospitalisation benefit is susceptible to medical inflation risk.

# Other Risks

Though, not imminent and generally observable, over long term there are some risks that may crystallise. These include:

- Retention Risk – The risk that employee will not be motivated to continue the service or start working with the Bank if no market comparable retirement benefit is provided.
- Final Salary Risk – The risk, for defined benefit gratuity, that any disproportionate salary merit increases in later service years will give rise to a multiplicative increase in the gratuity liability as such increase is applicable to all the past years of service.
- Model Risk – The defined benefit gratuity liability is valued by actuary each year. Further, the assets in the Fund are also marked to market. This two-tier valuation gives rise to the model risk.
- Operational Risk related to a separate entity - Retirement benefits are funded through a separate trust fund which is a different legal entity than the Bank. Generally, the protocols, processes, and conventions used throughout the Bank are not applicable or are not actively applied to the retirement benefit Funds. This gives rise to some specific operational risks.
- Compliance Risk – The risk that retirement benefits offered by the Bank do not comply with minimum statutory requirements.
- Legal / Political Risk – The risk that the legal / political environment changes and as a result, the Bank is required to offer additional or different retirement benefits than what the Bank projected. Specifically, in the light of recent Supreme Court decisions, this risk has materialised.

# 40.15 United National Bank Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme for U.K Employees

As part of the Shareholders’ Agreement (“the Agreement”) signed on November 9, 2001, between UBL UK and its shareholders, United Bank Limited and National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), it was agreed that UBL UK may participate as an associated employer in the United Bank Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (“the Scheme”) with effect from November 19, 2001, the date of completion of transfer of the businesses from the Bank and NBP into UBL UK (the Completion Date).

United Bank Limited remains responsible for the funding of the deferred members up to the Completion Date. The scheme is closed for new members and the accrual of benefits has ceased from January 1, 2010.

Full actuarial valuations using the Projected Unit Credit Method are obtained triennially and updated at each statement of financial position date.

The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary in the latest update as of December 31, 2022, are as follows:

|                                   | 2022  | 2021  |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Discount rate                     | 4.75% | 1.90% |

# 43. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 43.1 Fair Value Hierarchy

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Capital Adequacy Ratios:

| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio | 12.30% | 13.81% |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio               | 13.13% | 14.78% |
| Total Capital Adequacy Ratio                | 17.42% | 19.50% |

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (2021: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

Furthermore, under the Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at December 31, 2022. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 17.42% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 12.30% and 13.13% respectively.

Additionally, under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL is a sample D-SIB. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 0.5%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital.

Under the current capital adequacy regulations, credit risk and market risk exposures are measured using the Standardised Approach and operational risk is measured using the Basic Indicator Approach. Credit risk mitigants are also applied against the Bank’s exposures based on eligible collateral under comprehensive approach.

# 48.1

As COVID-19 has shown signs of abatement globally; countries around the world removed restrictions which was followed by a V-shaped recovery. However, the combination of unwarranted events such as Russia vs Ukraine war and climate change pushed the world into further energy crisis and high inflation mode.

For Pakistan, continued higher commodity prices and inflation deteriorated the foreign exchange reserves and resultantly put pressure on the exchange rate. In order to curtail the magnitude of the crisis, SBP increased interest rates by a massive 625 basis points and imposed a stringent criteria for import of goods. Sovereign foreign debt repayment has further exacerbated the foreign exchange reserves.

In the first half of the year banking industry flourished and saw an increase of 16% in the asset book. This expansion was driven by private sector advances and increase in investments, mainly government securities. Later part of the year saw a slowdown in economic activity due to prevailing economic crisis post massive floods, whereby a significant declining trend was observed in wholesale & retail sectors mainly in textile sector & consumer finance.

# 48.2 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty may not settle an obligation for full value, either when due or at any time thereafter. This risk arises from the potential that a customer's or counterparty’s willingness or ability to meet such an obligation is impaired, resulting in an economic loss to the Bank.

The credit risk management process is driven by the Bank's Risk Management Policy, Credit Policy for domestic operations, Collateral Management Policy, Credit Policy of respective overseas operation, which provide guidance in relation to credit initiation, approval, documentation and disbursement, credit maintenance and remedial management process. Individual credit authorities are delegated to credit officers by the Group Executive - Risk & Credit Policy (authorized by BoD), according to their seasoning / maturity. Approvals for Consumer loans are centralized, while approval authorities for overseas operations, Corporate, Commercial, SME and Agri exposures are delegated at a Country / Regional level. Furthermore, credit authorities are also delegated to business teams in various regions for Commercial, SME & Agri lending. All credit policy functions globally are centrally organized. The bank is at an advanced stage of automating the credit initiation and approval work flow. Domestic Corporate portfolio has achieved Go-Live status on December 28, 2022.

Concentration of credit risk exists if clients are engaged in similar activities or are located in the same geographical region or have comparable economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations would be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. The Bank manages, limits and controls concentrations of credit risk to individual counterparties and groups, and to industries, where appropriate. Limits are also applied to portfolios or sectors where the Bank considers it appropriate to restrict credit risk concentrations, to areas of higher risk, or to control the rate of portfolio growth. To manage cross border exposure, the bank has a Country Risk Policy in place which provides the framework for managing Country and FI related risks.

The Risk Management function of the Bank regularly conducts assessments of the credit portfolio to identify borrowers most likely to get affected due to changes in the continuously evolving business and economic environment. The Bank has been continuously reviewing the portfolio, to identify accounts susceptible to higher risk, resulting from the ongoing economic crisis.

IFRS 9 is applicable currently on the international branches of the Bank and requires the estimation of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) based on various parameters such as client fundamentals, credit structure, historical portfolio default rate and transitions i.e. probability of default, loss given default as well as current and forecasted macro-economic variables. Since 2020, the Bank has reviewed the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak along with other required scenarios on the inputs and assumptions for IFRS 9 ECL measurement based on best judgment as well as Regulatory guidelines of each overseas jurisdiction.

# 48.3 Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of changes in market conditions that may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, following a negative impact on earnings. Market risk mainly arises from trading activities carried out by Treasury and Capital Market (TCM) like lending / borrowing, Investments and client facilitating activities.

To manage Market Risk, a well-defined Market Risk policy approved by the Board of Directors is in place. The policy defines appropriate risk measures, controls and methods carried out for proactive market risk management. The Bank carries out market risk management through effective risk measurement tools including Value at Risk (VaR), Price Value per Basis Point (PVBP), Duration, Beta, and Expected Shortfall on regular basis. Bank also ascertains the impact of changes in market factors on Bank’s earnings through regular stress testing and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP).

# 48.7 Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) risk management and Pakistan FATF & APG action plan

The Bank monitors key risks on an ongoing basis to strengthen risk management in an effort to meet challenges emanating from a volatile market environment and the complexity driven by the changing Regulatory frameworks. By utilising comprehensive risk management processes and sophisticated control systems, the Bank aims to minimise the negative impact that may arise from varied degrees of risk exposures.

In response to changing landscape around FCC risks across the globe and in response to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) & Asia Pacific Group (APG) action plan and State Bank of Pakistan's Anti-Money Laundering, Combatting the Financing of Terrorism & Countering Proliferation Financing (AML / CFT / CPF) Regulations, the Bank embarked upon a comprehensive Financial Crime Compliance Transformation Program under the guidance of Board of Directors (BOD), specifically geared towards uplifting FCC Framework and fortifying controls across Process, People and Technology (Regtech) work streams in line with international best practices and Standards. Targeted investments were done across these work streams, brief highlights are as under:

# 49. YEMEN OPERATIONS

Despite risky situation and continued operational losses the Bank has been striving to honor liabilities for past eight years. However, on account of several factors, including but not limited to fragile political and economic situation in Yemen, bankruptcy of CBY Sana'a, existence of two Central Banks (i.e. CBY Sana'a and CBY Aden), has resulted in illiquid market, which does not appears to be reversed in near future.

It is no longer possible for the Bank to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the Bank and caused by circumstances entirely beyond the Bank's control. Therefore, Bank has completely exited from Yemen. The Bank is cognizant of the associated risks arising out of its exit from Yemen.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of non-performance or default by a party to a derivatives transaction, resulting in an adverse impact on the Bank’s profitability. Credit risk associated with derivatives transactions is categorised into settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Credit proposals for derivatives transactions are approved by the Credit Committee. The credit exposure of each counterparty is estimated and monitored against approved counterparty limits by Treasury Middle Office (TMO) on a daily basis.

# Market risk

The Bank, as a policy, hedges back-to-back all options transactions. In addition, the Bank does not carry any exchange risk on its Cross Currency Swaps portfolio as it hedges the exposure in the interbank market. To manage the interest rate risk of Interest Rate Derivatives, the Bank has implemented various limits which are monitored and reported by TMO on a daily basis.

# Liquidity risk

Derivatives transactions, usually being non-funded in nature, do not carry a specific funding liquidity risk. The liquidity risk arises from the fact that in Pakistan, interest rate derivatives generally have a uni-directional demand, and no perfect hedge is available. The Bank mitigates its risk by limiting the portfolio in terms of tenor, notional and sensitivity limits, and can also hedge its risk by taking on and off balance sheet positions in the interbank market, where available.

# Operational risk

The staff involved in the trading, settlement and risk management of derivatives is carefully trained to deal with the complexities involved in the process. Adequate systems and controls are in place to carry out derivatives transactions smoothly. Each transaction is processed in accordance with the product program or a transaction memo, which contains detailed guidance on the accounting and operational aspects of the transaction to further mitigate operational risk. In addition, TMO and the Compliance and Control Department are assigned the responsibility of monitoring any deviation from policies and procedures. The Bank’s Audit and Inspection Group also reviews this function, with a regular review of systems, transactional processes, accounting practices and end-user roles and responsibilities.

The Bank uses FX and Derivatives module of Treasury System which provides an end-to-end valuation solution, supports the routine transactional process and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures, carry out stress tests and sensitivity analysis. TMO produces various reports on a periodic basis which are reviewed by senior management. These reports provide details of the derivatives business profile such as outstanding positions, profitability, risk exposures and the status of compliance with limits.

| (a) For filers of income tax returns:     | 15.00% |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| (b) For non-filers of income tax returns: | 30.00% |

To enable the Bank to make tax deduction on the amount of cash dividend @ 15.00% instead of 30.00%, all the shareholders whose names are not entered into the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) provided on the website of the Federal Board of Revenue (“FBR”), despite the fact that they are filers, are advised to make sure that their names are entered into ATL before the date of issuance of Dividend Warrants, otherwise tax on their cash dividend will be deducted @ 30.00%.

The corporate shareholders having CDC account are required to have their National Tax Number (NTN) updated with their respective participants, whereas corporate physical shareholders should send a copy of their NTN certificates to the Bank or Bank’s Share Registrar and Share Transfer Agent, M/s. THK Associates (Pvt.) Limited, Plot No. 32-C, Jami Commercial Street 2, D.H.A., Phase VII, Karachi-75500.

For shareholders holding their shares jointly as per the clarification issued by the FBR, withholding tax will be determined separately on “Filer / Non-Filer” status of principal shareholder as well as joint-holder(s) based on their shareholding proportions. Therefore, all shareholders who hold shares jointly are required to provide shareholding proportions of principal shareholder and Joint-holder(s) in respect of shares held by them to the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent in writing as follows:
