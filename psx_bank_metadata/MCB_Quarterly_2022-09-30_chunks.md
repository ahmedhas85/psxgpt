With strong build up in core earnings, MCB's Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the nine months period ended September 30, 2022 increased to Rs. 51.6 billion against PBT of Rs. 38.3 billion of corresponding period last year. On the back of strong overall performance, the Bank reported highest ever quarterly profit before tax of Rs. 19.05 billion in 3Q, 2022. Retrospective application of tax amendments along with higher tax rates for current period enacted through Finance Act, 2022 resulted into 62% average tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to average tax rate of 41% for the corresponding period last year. Profit After Tax (PAT) registered a decline of 12% from Rs. 22.6 billion to Rs. 19.9 billion; translating into Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 16.75 compared to an EPS of Rs. 19.03 in corresponding period last year.

On the back of strong volumetric growth in current account and favorable yield curve movements, net interest income for 9M'22 increased by 29% over corresponding period last year. Average current deposits of the Bank registered a growth of Rs 91.6 billion (+17%) YoY.

Non-markup income registered a growth of 41% and reported a base of Rs. 20.25 billion against Rs. 14.38 billion in the corresponding period last year. The contribution from foreign exchange line, debit cards, trade business and home remittances remained strong during the period.

Despite an exceptionally high inflation, impact of currency devaluation and continued investments in human resources, branch network and technological upgradation, operating expenses of the Bank were recorded at Rs. 30.52 billion, growing by a modest 16% year on year, while the cost to income ratio significantly improved to 37.3% from 42.5% reported in corresponding period last year.

Proactive monitoring and recovery efforts led to a net provision reversal against non-performing loans (NPL's) which aggregated to Rs. 1,883 million for the period under review. Persistent focus on maintaining a robust risk management framework encompassing structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk. The Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 52.47 billion. The Bank has not taken FSV benefit in calculation of specific provision against its non-performing loans (NPL's) base. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 85.14% and 8.37%, respectively.

On the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank grew by 5.4% and was reported at Rs. 2,076 billion. Gross advances registered a slight decline of Rs. 9 billion (-1%), whereas the consumer lending book grew by Rs. 4.8 billion (+12%). During the period under review, MCB's strategic objective of achieving growth in no-cost current account base was reinforced by an uncertain and volatile interest rate scenario, leading to persistent re-pricing gaps between the earning assets and liabilities. Hence, the Bank registered a growth of 21% in non-remunerative deposits to close the period at Rs. 680.33 billion. CASA mix was reported at an industry leading level of 93.73% which reflects customer loyalty earned by the Bank over 75 years through sustained provision of quality services.

MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 2,666 million, during the period under review with market share of 11.5% as an active participant in SBP's cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.

During the ongoing year, the Bank celebrates successful completion of 75 years of its banking services to the nation. From modest beginnings, the Bank has transformed into a dynamic and innovative organization; overcoming a multitude of challenges along the way with resolve and fortitude. Recognition by the globally coveted Asia Money awards as 'Pakistan's Best Corporate Bank of the Year' in 2022 is a testament to its legacy of posting consistent and exceptional performance for its stakeholders.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is 17.6% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank's Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 16.47% against the requirement of 6%. Bank's capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 5.62% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 203.85% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 134.66% against requirement of 100%.

The Board of Directors has declared a 3rd interim cash dividend of Rs. 5.00 per share i.e 50%, in addition to 90% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the nine months period ended September 30, 2022 to 140%.

# Economy Review

As we complete the third quarter of the calendar year, the global economy is suffering from slower growth, higher inflation and tighter monetary policy. Pakistan's economic situation also remains fragile with political conflict adding to the uncertainty. Additionally, floods have adversely impacted economic activity, putting pressure on both inflation and balance of payment. The World Bank has estimated $32 billion losses caused by the floods and now expects Pakistan's GDP to slow down to 2% for the current fiscal year.

Inflation in Pakistan remained extremely elevated through the quarter. Annual Inflation increased to 23.2% on year-on-year basis in Sep-22 as compared to an increase of 27.3% in Aug-22. SBP has forecasted inflation for FY23 to be in the range of 18% to 20%. PKR devaluation, higher global commodity prices and crop-damage due to floods will likely continue to exert price.

# Current Economic Overview

Pressures in the near future.

On the external front, external debt payments and persistent current account deficits continued to exert pressure on the balance of payments. The current account deficit did show an improvement in Aug-22 coming in at USD 0.70 billion. SBP's foreign exchange reserves fell to USD 7.9 billion in Sep-22. It is anticipated that foreign reserves will increase after expected loans from ADB, IMF and World Bank. The international investors, however, continue to take a grim view of Pakistan's external account. Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") also downgraded the Government of Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from B3. For these reasons, yields on Pakistan Euro bonds have spiked over the last few months.

In October's monetary policy, the State Bank of Pakistan maintained the policy rate at 15%. It noted the continued deceleration in economy activity especially given the recent flooding. Most of the demand indicators showed declines in both July-22 and Aug-22. SBP projects the GDP growth for FY23 to be lower (2%) than the earlier project number (3-4%).

## Chunk 6


# Future Outlook

Pakistan's GDP growth is projected to slow down through the year. The expected global recession should lead to softening of global commodity prices. This will have a positive effect on Pakistan's balance of payment. Additionally, Pakistan is expecting aid from the international community in response to the devastating floods. These external flows should help prop up the foreign currency reserves in the short-term. However, given the politically volatile situation, risks remain on the fiscal front. Any slippages will lead to negative consequences for the economy.

Accordingly, no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 23.4 Taxation

For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2021, the tax department disputed Bank's treatment on certain issues, where the Bank's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 1,158 million (2021: Rs. 1,497 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance/deducted at source.

The Bank has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Bank are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Bank's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# For The Nine Months Period Ended September 30, 2022

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building.

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'held to maturity'. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available financial statements.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

| Amended Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8                                       | January 1, 2023 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – Amendment to IAS 12 | January 1, 2023 |
| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1                          | January 1, 2024 |

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular Letter no. 03 dated July 5, 2022, the applicability of IFRS 9 to banks in Pakistan has been deferred to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Therefore, these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime to the extent of the Group's domestic operations, whereas the requirements of this standard are incorporated for overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

| 21.1 Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not been taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R\&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Group, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR. |                                  |                                                                     |                                                                             |                                  |                   |             |   |   |   |   |

# 23.3 Other contingent liabilities

Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts 23.3.1 31,549,197 26,189,566

These mainly represent counter claims by borrowers for damages and other claims relating to banking transactions. Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Group’s favour and the possibility of any adverse outcome is remote.

# 23.4 Taxation

For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2021, the tax department disputed Group's treatment on certain issues, where the Group's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 1,158 million (2021: Rs. 1,497 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance / deducted at source.

The Group has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Group are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Group's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

| Item                                                            | Valuation approach and input used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Federal Government securities                                   | The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates. Floating rate PIBs are revalued using PKFRV rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Term Finance and Bonds                                          | Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. |
| Foreign exchange contracts                                      | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Derivatives                                                     | The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.                                                                                                             |
| Unlisted Shares                                                 | Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Mutual Funds                                                    | Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Operating fixed assets (land and building) & Non-banking assets | Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated financial statements.

The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in listed ordinary shares and units of mutual funds.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance certificates, FX options, Cross Currency Swaps, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Exchange Contracts.

(c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.
