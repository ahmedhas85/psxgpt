## Chunk 9


# Net Markup Income

Net markup income was recorded at Rs. 21.5 billion for Q1’22, with an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 2021. This revenue base is 19% higher than the last quarter of 2021 as the balance sheet has repriced at higher yields. The Bank’s markup earning asset base averaged Rs. 2.1 trillion in Q1’22, an increase of 21% over Q1’21. The 3 month secondary market rates averaged 10.6% in Q1’22 versus 7.2% in Q1’21 which supported the increase in net markup income. Resultantly, Bank level net interest margins (NIMs) increased by 30 bps to 4.3% in Q1’22 versus 4.0% in Q1’21.

The Bank’s domestic deposits base averaged Rs. 1.5 trillion in Q1’22, growing by 8% over the corresponding period of last year. The increase is mainly due to a growth of 11% in average CASA deposits, which were measured at Rs. 1.3 trillion for Q1’22, i.e. a net increase of over Rs. 127 billion. Domestic current deposits averaged Rs. 674 billion in Q1’22, a growth of 11% over Q1’21. The Bank continued its focus on acquiring new to bank customers, particularly within its core deposits base, as it added 162,000 new current account relationships in Q1’22 (Q1’21: 159,000 new current account relationships). The portfolio savings deposits averaged Rs. 644 billion, also growing by 11% year on year. Resultantly, the domestic average CASA to total deposits ratio improved from 86% in Q1’21 to 88% in Q1’22. Term deposits averaged Rs. 183 billion in Q1’22, down 9% year on year, as the Bank actively focused on expanding its portfolio mix without acquiring high cost deposits. The domestic cost of deposits increased from 3.4% in Q1’21 to 4.5%, largely due to the increase in overall interest rates and impact of minimum floor rate of return on savings deposits. UBL International’s deposits averaged USD 1.3 billion in Q1’22, largely in line with last year, while its cost of deposits was measured at 1.1% in Q1’22 (Q1’21: 1.2%).

# Capital Ratios

The Bank seeks to maintain strong levels of capitalization to build resilience and maintain adequate buffers over regulatory requirements. UBL had earlier been designated a Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This designation initially required the Bank to hold an additional 1.5% Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital surcharge, over and above the applicable minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) limit in 2019, on both a standalone and consolidated basis. However, SBP reduced the HLA surcharge by 50 bps to 1.0% effective March 2020.

In the latest assessment carried out by the SBP in October 2021, UBL is no longer a D-SIB. However, the Bank shall continue to meet the higher HLA capital surcharge, in the form of additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) capital of 1.0% on a standalone and consolidated basis till June 30, 2022.

The SBP has also provided regulatory relief for COVID-19 to support the banking sector in extending credit facilities to its customers. In this respect, SBP has reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, for the time being till further instructions are issued. Thus, the minimum CAR requirement for UBL stood at 12.5% (including the HLA Surcharge of 1.0%) as at March 31, 2022.

The Bank’s overall CAR stood at 21.7% at Mar’22 (Dec’21: 21.5%), maintaining a buffer of 9.2% over the minimum regulatory requirement of 12.5%. The CET-1 ratio stood at 15.3% at Mar’22 (Dec’21: 15.1%). Total Tier 1 Capital ratio was measured at 16.4% at Mar’22 (Dec’21: 16.3%).

The Board of Directors of UBL declared an interim cash dividend Rs. 5.0 per share in their meeting in Islamabad on April 20, 2022, along with the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

# Economy Review

The global economy is clearly impacted by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Prices of key commodities, including food and energy, have witnessed substantial increase in 2022. This has put significant pressures on domestic inflation as well as the balance of payment position which has resulted in a sharp devaluation in the local currency. The State Bank of Pakistan, in its emergency meeting held on April 7, 2022, raised the policy rate by 250 bps to 12.25%.

High level of imports continue to exert significant pressures on the external front as the country recorded a current account deficit (CAD) of USD 12.1 billion for the 8M FY’22 as against a surplus of USD 1.0 billion for the corresponding period of last year. The country’s balance of trade recorded a deficit of USD 35.4 billion for 9M FY’22, with a significant increase of 70%. The country’s imports stood at USD 58.7 billion for 9M FY’22 as against USD 39.5 billion last year, recording an increase of 49%. The country’s exports are picking up well, being recorded at USD 23.3 billion for 9M FY’22, growing by 25%, mainly on the back of high value added textiles, as well as other manufactured goods.

The contribution of home remittances to support the country’s overall foreign exchange position continues to be significant as inflows of USD 20.1 billion were recorded for 8M FY’22, with an increase of 8% over the corresponding period of last year. The country’s FX markets also remained volatile for much of Q1’22 with a devaluation in the PKR of 3% versus the USD, closing at Rs. 183.5 at March 31, 2022. Looking ahead, higher commodity prices are likely to exert significant pressures on the country’s FX reserves. On the inflation front, CPI was measured at 12.7% for Mar’22 (Feb’22: 12.2%, Dec’21: 12.3%), one of the highest levels in recent history. Average inflation for 9M FY’22 was measured at 10.7%.

versus 8.4% in the corresponding period of last year. The KSE-100 index largely range bound this quarter, impacted by international and local landscapes, closed at 44,929 points at March 31, 2022.

Banking sector deposits stood at Rs. 19.8 trillion at Mar’22, down 6% over Dec’21. Sector advances were recorded at Rs. 10.0 trillion at Mar’22, largely in line with Dec’21. Non-performing loans for the banking industry stood at Rs. 860 billion at Dec’21, 4% above Dec’20, as the asset quality improved to 7.9% at Dec’21 from 9.2% at Dec’20.

# UBL International

The economic environment within the GCC has started to pick up momentum as the pandemic gradually recedes together with a sharp rise in oil prices. Within International, UBL is now stabilizing well driven by a more sustainable and strong base of low cost deposits. On the asset side, lending book is maintained with rigorous oversight to contain any new NPL formation. The Bank is actively pursuing more trade based financing opportunities while expanding its FI lending book. Excess liquidity is primarily deployed in debt securities with an aim to maintain healthy net interest margins.

UBL International recorded a PBT of USD 4.7 million for Q1’22 (Q1’21: USD 10.6 million). Gross revenues for the International business were recorded at USD 15.5 million (Q1’21: USD 23.5 million). Net markup income was recorded at USD 12 million in Q1’22, in line with last year. Non markup income of USD 3.5 million was earned in Q1’22 as against USD 11.6 million earned last year, which was higher due to capital gains. Operating expenses for the International business recorded a decline of 5%, after restructuring to a leaner and more efficient operating model completed early last year. As a result of strong oversight and an aggressive focus on recoveries, net provisioning expense was reduced from USD 4.6 million in Q1’21 to USD 3.1 million in 2022.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting standards that are effective in the current period

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions from January 01, 2018. Accordingly, the requirements of this standard are incorporated in the Bank’s unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular Letter no. 24 dated July 05, 2021, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments has been made applicable to Banks in Pakistan for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is being assessed as final implementation guidelines are awaited from SBP.

There are certain other amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. These are either considered to not be relevant or do not have any significant impact and accordingly have not been detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Bank has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

The Income Tax returns of the Bank have been filed upto the tax year 2021 (financial year ended December 31, 2020) and were deemed to be assessed under section 120 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance). The Income Tax authorities have issued amended assessment orders for the tax years 2003 to 2020, and created additional tax demands (including disallowances of provisions made prior to Seventh Schedule) of Rs.13,752 million (December 31, 2021: Rs.13,752 million). The Bank has filed appeals before the various appellate forums against these amendments. Where the appellate authorities have allowed relief on certain issues, the assessing authorities have filed appeals before higher appellate forums. Where the appellate authorities have not allowed relief the Bank has filed appeals before higher appellate forums. The management of the Bank is confident that the appeals will be decided in favour of the Bank.

The tax returns for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) branches have been filed upto the tax year 2021 (financial year ended December 31, 2020) under the provisions of section 120(1) read with section 114 of the Ordinance and in compliance with the terms of the agreement between banks and the Azad Kashmir Council in May 2005. The returns filed are considered as deemed assessment orders under the law.

The tax authorities have also carried out monitoring for Federal Excise Duty, Sales tax and withholding taxes covering period from year ended 2005 to 2019. Consequently various addbacks and demands were raised creating a total demand of Rs. 2,632 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 2,632 million). The Bank has filed appeals against all such demands and is confident that these would be decided in the favor of the Bank.

The tax returns for Yemen have been filed upto the year ended December 31, 2019 and for UAE and Qatar branches upto the year ended December 31, 2020 under the provisions of the laws prevailing in the respective countries, and are deemed as assessed unless opened for reassessment.

The Bank has received corrective tax assessment of QAR 642 thousand (Rs. 32.157 million) from the General tax Authority (GTA) in respect of tax year 2015. Management has filed an appeal against the said penalty and is confident that the matters will be decided in favor of the Bank and the possibility of any outcome against it is remote.

|          | These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |
| 22.3.2   | During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account. |                   |

# 34. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 34.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the year ended March 31, 2022 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2021: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and High Loss Absorbency Requirement of 1.0% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

In accordance to the Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2022. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 21.74% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 15.28% and 16.41% respectively.

Under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL is a sample D-SIB. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 1.0%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level during 2022.

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the two central banks regulators, i.e. CBY Sana’a and CBY Aden, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana’a to facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch’s control. UBL is cognizant of the associated risks of ceasing its branch’s business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the format of financial statements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated March 22, 2019.

However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of Companies Act, 2017.

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 40 to these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Group has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvement, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the consolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

The Income Tax returns of the Bank have been filed up to the tax year 2021 (financial year ended December 31, 2020) and were deemed to be assessed under section 120 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance). The Income Tax authorities have issued amended assessment orders for the tax years 2003 to 2020, and created additional tax demands (including disallowances of provisions made prior to Seventh Schedule) of Rs. 13,752 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 13,752 million). The Bank has filed appeals before the various appellate forums against these amendments.

The management of the Bank is confident that the appeals will be decided in favour of the Bank.

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Group from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in favour of the Group and the possibility of any outcome against the Group is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.2

During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 36. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 36.1 Fair Value Hierarchy

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs. 10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the period ended March 31, 2022, stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2021: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 2.5%. and High Loss Absorbency Requirement of 1.0% of the risk weighted exposures of the Bank.

In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, SBP via BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions.

In accordance to the Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at March 31, 2022. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 19.16% whereas the CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stand at 13.59% and 14.54% respectively.

Under the SBP’s Framework for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) introduced vide BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2019 dated April 13, 2019, UBL is a sample D-SIB. In line with this framework, the Bank is required to meet the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) capital charge of 1.0%, in the form of Additional CET 1 capital, on a standalone as well as consolidated level during 2022.

# FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022

# 41. YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for
the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the two central banks regulators, i.e. CBY
Sana’a and CBY Aden, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana’a to
facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued
operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not
attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch’s control. UBL is cognizant of the
associated risks of ceasing its branch’s business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is
prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.
