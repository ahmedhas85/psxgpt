DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank, I am pleased to present the condensed interim un-audited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

During the first quarter under review, Pakistan's economic and financial outlook continued to improve, moving steadily toward stabilization. Fitch Ratings upgraded Pakistan's sovereign credit rating to 'B-' with a stable outlook, citing a current account surplus of USD 1,852 million in the first nine months of FY2025.

On the global front, the new U.S. administration's imposition of trade tariffs has disrupted global trade flows, creating uncertainty for Pakistan's exports to the U.S., though the tariffs have been temporarily suspended. Meanwhile, Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement for the release of the second tranche-USD 1 billion-under the USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility, expected to be disbursed in May 2025. The Pakistani Rupee remained stable, averaging below Rs. 280/USD during the period.

GDP growth for FY2025 is projected between 2.5% and 3.5%. Inflation dropped significantly, reaching 0.7% in March 2025-its lowest level in 30 years-compared to a peak of nearly 38% in May 2023. This decline is attributed to a stable exchange rate, declining global commodity prices, and tight monetary policies. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) expects inflation to remain within the 5%-7% range in FY2026, down from its earlier forecast of 11.5%-13.5%.

Remittances hit an all-time high of over USD 4 billion in March 2025. In January 2025, the SBP reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points to 12.00% and maintained this rate in the March 2025 MPC meeting, despite lower-than-expected inflation on the back of stable food and energy prices.

By the Grace of Allah, HABIBMETRO posted a profit before tax of Rs. 12,962 million for Q1 2025, with earnings per share after tax of Rs. 5.78. Net mark-up income stood at Rs. 17,634 million, while non-mark-up income increased by 44.9% to Rs. 5,406 million. The Bank's investments stood at Rs. 755,047 million, while net advances increased by 26.6% to Rs. 600,270 million. Deposits grew by 9.1% to Rs. 1,011,246 million, with current deposits comprising 39.6% of the total.

The Bank's net equity stood at Rs. 114,879 million, while the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) remained strong at 16.55%.

The Board of Directors is pleased to announce an interim cash dividend of Rs. 2.50 per share (25%) for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

The Bank's strong credit ratings of AA+ (long-term) and A1+ (short-term) were reaffirmed by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA), reflecting a high degree of credit quality and a strong capacity to meet financial obligations.

# 21.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment in subsidiaries and those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2.

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV, PKISRV and PSX rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters website and PSX.

Forward contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3.

Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Property and equipment and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 2 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets.

The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 21.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment those classified as amortised cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as amortised cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2.

Federal government debt securities: The fair value of government securities are valued using PKRV, PKFRV, PKISRV and PSX rates.

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters website and PSX.

Forward contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3.

Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Property and equipment and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 2 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.
