# Economic Review

After experiencing a relatively stable economic environment in 2024, the global economy is expected to face a more complex and uncertain landscape in 2025. The introduction of new tariff measures by the United States, along-with reciprocal actions by key trading partners and heightened geopolitical tensions, are expected to weigh on global growth and keep economic activity under pressure. Reflecting these changes, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its April 2025 edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), has revised the global growth forecast downward to 2.8%, compared to the earlier projection of 3.3% published in January 2025.

According to the IMF, global headline inflation is now expected to ease to 4.3% in 2025, slightly higher than the earlier estimate of 4.2%. For Pakistan, the IMF projects a significant decline in average inflation rate to 5.1% in FY’25, down from 23.4% inflation rate estimated for 2024. This downward revision reflects easing inflationary pressures, supported by a tighter monetary policy stance, a relatively stable exchange rate, and declining global commodity prices.

With modest growth and easing inflation, Pakistan’s economy is exhibiting signs of gradual stabilization. However, in light of ongoing global trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions, the IMF, in its latest WEO, has revised Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast for 2025 downward from 3.0% to 2.6%.

Despite a sharper rise in imports relative to exports, stability in the external sector was supported by a notable increase in workers’ remittances. As a result, the current account posted a surplus of US$ 1.9 billion during Jul–Mar FY’25, compared to a deficit of US$ 1.7 billion in the same period last year—reflecting a significant improvement of 213%. Workers’ remittances reached US$ 28.0 billion during Jul-Mar FY’25, marking a substantial increase of 33% from US$ 21.0 billion in the corresponding period last year. For the month of March 2025, it increased by 37% on YoY basis to record at US$ 4.1 billion, compared to US$ 3.0 billion in the month of March 2024.



Financial Review

Pakistan’s total foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 15.6 billion as on March 28, 2025, compared to US$ 12.8 billion at the end of March 2024 showing an increase of 22%. Whereas, reserves with SBP increased by 33% to US$ 10.7 billion at the end of March 2025 from US$ 8.0 billion at the end of March 2024.

The trade deficit widened to US$ 21.0 billion during Jul-Mar FY’25, reflecting a 15% increase compared to US$ 18.3 billion during the same period last year. This expansion was primarily driven by a higher growth in imports relative to exports. Exports of goods and services rose by 8% to US$ 30.9 billion in Jul-Mar FY’25 up from US$ 28.6 billion during Jul-Mar FY’24. Meanwhile imports of goods and services, grew by 11% reaching US$ 51.9 billion during Jul-Mar FY’25, compared to US$ 46.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.

The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained volatile during the quarter and closed at 117,807 points on March 27, 2025.

Money supply (M2) stood at Rs. 37,458 billion at the end of March 2025, compared to Rs. 33,162 billion at the end of March 2024 depicting a growth of 13%. Currency in Circulation (CIC) recorded at Rs. 10,261 billion by the end of March 2025 up by 19% from Rs. 8,651 billion at the end of March 2024.

National Consumer Price Index (CPI) on YoY basis stood at 0.7% in the month of March 2025, compared to 1.5% in the previous month and 20.7% in March 2024. On MoM basis it remained at 0.9% in March 2025, compared to -0.8% in the previous month and 1.7% in March 2024.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with view to maintain cautious monetary policy stance to stabilize inflation within target range of 5 – 7 percent decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 12%.

# Financial Review

The banking sector maintained its resilience during the first quarter of 2025. Despite facing challenges, the sector managed to record expansion of 2% in its asset base to reach Rs. 53,410 billion as of March 28, 2025, up from Rs. 52,285 billion as of December 31, 2024. Investments increased by 11%, to Rs. 32,378 billion at the end of the period, compared to Rs. 29,129 billion as of December 31, 2024. However, gross advances of the banking industry shrunk by 16%, recorded at Rs. 13,474 billion as of March 28, 2025 down from Rs. 16,009 billion as on December 31, 2024. On the liabilities side, total deposits grew by 5%, standing at Rs. 31,747 billion as of March 28, 2025, compared to Rs. 30,283 billion as of December 31, 2024.

Allied Bank posted markup income of Rs. 71,647 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. This represents a 24% decrease from Rs. 94,312 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Mark-up/Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, declined to Rs. 46,283 million, representing a 29% decrease from Rs. 65,165 million recorded in the corresponding period last year. This decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the cost of deposits and borrowing expenses, supported by a decrease in the benchmark policy rate. Consequently, net markup/interest income stood at Rs. 25,364 million for the quarter under review, down by 13% from Rs. 29,147 million in the same period last year.

Fee income increased by 5%, reaching Rs. 3,723 million as of March 31, 2025, compared to Rs. 3,549 million as of March 31, 2024. This growth was primarily driven by higher card-related fees, branch banking customer fees, and the card acquiring business.

Capital Gain increased by 146% to Rs. 745 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to Rs. 303 million for the corresponding quarter last year, due to gain on Euro Bonds and Federal Government securities.

Foreign Exchange Income of the Bank increased by 36% to reach Rs. 1,728 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to Rs. 1,272 million for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase is primarily attributable to comparatively favorable swap curve.

Driven by higher fee income, capital gain and foreign exchange income, partially offset by lower dividend income and other income, total non-markup income of ABL increased by 13% reaching Rs. 7,148 million for the quarter ended March 31 2025, compared to Rs. 6,335 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Administrative expenses grew by 15% in the first quarter of 2025, reaching Rs. 15,333 million compared to Rs. 13,378 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher expenditure on advertisement and publicity, depreciation and amortization, fee and subscription, deposit protection and card related Expenses.

The Bank recorded a profit before taxation of Rs. 17,315 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, reflecting a 22% decrease compared to Rs. 22,266 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Profit after taxation for the quarter under review stood at Rs. 8,190 million, marking a 28% decline compared to Rs. 11,364 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Earnings per share of the Bank stood at Rs. 7.15 for the quarter March 31, 2025, compared to Rs. 9.92 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Allied Bank is committed to a hybrid expansion approach that blends “digital” and “brick-and-mortar” banking operations, with an increased focus on digital banking products and services. The Bank operates a large ATM network consisting of 1,650 machines, including 1,403 on-site, 242 off-site, and 5 Mobile Banking Units (MBU). As of the end of the quarter, the Bank’s branch outreach increased to 1,512 branches, with 1,333 conventional, 161 Islamic banking branches and 18 digital branches.

As of March 31, 2025, Allied Bank’s total assets stood at Rs. 2,737,977 million, reflecting a 3% decline from Rs. 2,816,969 million as of December 31, 2024. Notable increases were observed in investments, property and equipment, and other assets. Despite the decline in total assets, the Bank’s net assets increased by 2%, rising to Rs. 237,512 million from Rs. 233,901 million over the same period.

Gross advances and net advances reached Rs. 827,739 million and Rs. 812,455 million respectively as of March 31, 2025, compared to Rs. 1,066,348 million and Rs. 1,051,314 million as of December 31, 2024. The non-performing advances portfolio stood at Rs. 13,281 million as of March 31, 2025.

# Future Outlook

Amid ongoing global trade conflicts, geo-political tensions and associated financial risks, the IMF in its April 2025 WEO, revised its global GDP growth projection for 2026 downward to 3.0%, compared to earlier projection of 3.3% made in its January 2025 outlook. On the domestic front, the IMF has projected Pakistan’s GDP growth at 3.0% for 2025 in its January WEO, reflecting a 0.2% downward revision from its previous estimate of 3.2% in the October 2024 WEO. Similarly, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expects real GDP growth for FY’25 to remain in the upper half of the projected range of 2.5% to 3.5%. For 2026, the IMF maintains its growth forecast at 4.0%, unchanged from the October 2024 projection.

In its April 2025 WEO, the IMF projected global headline inflation to decline to 3.6% for 2026, slightly higher from its previous forecast of 3.5% for 2026 in January 2025 WEO. On domestic front, the MPC of SBP expects the headline inflation for FY’25 to average between 5.0% and 7.0%.

# 25.3.2 Income tax assessments

The income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalized up to and including tax year 2024 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2024, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 38,524 million (2024: 38,524 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Bank and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references, no provision has been made by the Bank on aggregate sum of Rs. 38,524 million (2024: 38,524 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Bank.

Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2019 and tax year 2022 created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 2,029 million (2024: 2,029 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Bank; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 2,029 million (2024: 2,029 million).

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005/Sales Tax Act/Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 1,144 million (2024: 1,144 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that the aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,144 million (2024: 1,144 million).

On November 8, 2018, the Honorable Court was pleased to Order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated 15.01.2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Moreover, on 04.01.2023, the Appellate Board has ordered that ABL’s appeals now stand adjourned sine die till the final disposal of ABL’s constitutional petitions which are pending before the Sindh High Court. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Financial instruments included in level 3 comprise of investments in Unlisted shares.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024.

| 25.3.3 | While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporter namely: Fateh Textile Mills Limited, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court (FEAC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has arbitrarily adjudicated penalties against various banks including Rs.2,173 million in aggregate against Allied Bank Limited (the Bank). Against the said judgments, the Bank had filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions (CP) in the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. The Honorable High Court granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Meanwhile, alongwith other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated January 15, 2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty. |                   |

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Financial instruments included in level 3 comprise of investments in Unlisted shares.
