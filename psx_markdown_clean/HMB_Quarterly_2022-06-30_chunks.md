# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW


On behalf of the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank, I am pleased to present the condensed interim un-audited financial statements for the half year ended 30 June 2022.

Rising Commodity prices along with supply chain disruptions due to ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, have kept Pakistan's economy under stress during the HY 2022. This has resulted in increased Current Account deficit and upsurge in Inflation, causing the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to adopt tightened monetary policy measures as also adopted by various global economies.

Current Account deficit widened to USD 17.2 billion for FY22 mainly on account of increased energy imports compared to USD 2.6 billion in the corresponding period last year. The import bill grew significantly during the fiscal year, mainly due to high cost of energy related imports, and was recorded at USD 84.2 billion for FY22, up 34 percent YoY. Exports increased by 24.8 percent to USD 39.4 billion in FY22. Further, remittances stood at USD 31.2 billion for FY22 with a 6% increase when compared to last year.

The recent taxation and fiscal measures including reversal of energy subsidies coupled with increased global commodity prices caused inflation to hike significantly to 21.3 percent in the month of June (FY22 - 12.2 percent) and further to a 14-year high of 24.9 percent in July.

The SBP raised interest rates by a cumulative 525 bps since December 31, 2021, including the 125 bps increase in its most recent meeting held on 7 July 2022, taking the policy rate to 15.0 percent.

The Pak Rupee depreciated by 16.1 percent since 31 December 2021, from Rs. 176.5 to Rs. 204.85 against US Dollar in June 2022.

By the Grace of Allah, HabibMetro has posted profit before tax for the first six months amounted to Rs. 12,033 million, an increase of 24.2 percent compared to Rs 9,685 million in the same period last year. This translates into after tax earnings per share of Rs. 6.25 per share.

The Bank's net mark-up income increased to Rs. 16,109 million, a growth of 11.8 percent whereas non-markup income increased by 46.0 percent to Rs. 7,098 million as compared to Rs. 4,863 million during the same period last year.

Investments stood at Rs. 695,693 million with a growth of 4.1 percent compared to 31 December 2021 whereas Net Advances grew by 13 percent to Rs. 450,129 million during the period under review.

Meanwhile, deposits increased to Rs. 875,218 million as against Rs. 772,286 million in 31 December 2021. The Bank continues to focus on low cost deposit mobilization - as a result of which, current deposits increased by 12.6 percent during the period under review to Rs. 301,894 million.

The Bank's Net Equity stands at Rs. 70,178 million with a capital adequacy level of 14.2 percent.

# Bank Ratings and Operations

The Bank maintained AA+ rating for Long Term, and A1+ rating for Short Term. These ratings by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) denote a high credit quality, with a low expectation of credit risk, and a strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

# Branch Expansion

During the period under review, the Bank opened 34 new branches in 25 cities in the country. With this increase, HABIBMETRO now operates a network of 493 branches in 191 cities across Pakistan, including 52 Islamic banking branches, and 221 Islamic banking windows.

# Banking Services

The Bank provides a comprehensive spectrum of banking services and products. These include specialized trade finance products and digital banking solutions such as secured mobile, web & SMS Banking services, globally accepted Visa Cards and a nationwide network of ATMs.

# Corporate Social Responsibility

Being a conscientious corporate citizen, your Bank acknowledges its corporate social responsibilities and continues to make regular contributions to a host of non-profit / social organizations with primary focus on healthcare and education.

# Digital Banking Promotion

The Bank continues to promote its digital banking channels (mobile app, web banking, debit cards) to encapsulate the various digital banking opportunities available in the country.

## Chunk 3

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I would like to place on record our sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their continued support and guidance to the Bank. I would also like to thank our valued customers for the trust and patronage that they continue to extend to us. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the unwavering dedication of the staff of HABIBMETRO Bank, who continue to work tirelessly to provide our customers with uninterrupted financial services. Their efforts enable the Bank to grow from strength to strength.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF HABIB METROPOLITAN BANK LIMITED



# Report on review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited ("the Bank") as at 30 June 2022 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit or loss account, the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity, the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of cash flows and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the six-months period then ended (here-in-after-referred to as "unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

---

## Chunk 5

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

---

## Chunk 6

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

---

## Chunk 7

# Other Matter

The figures for the quarter ended 30 June 2022 in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Amyn Pirani.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan.


IFAS 3 shall be followed with effect from the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in respect of accounting for transactions relating to 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' as defined by the said standard. The standard will result in certain new disclosures in the financial statements of the Bank. Furthermore, SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions and prescribed the Banks to prepare their annual and periodical financial statements as per existing prescribed formats issued vide BPRD Circular 2 of 2018, as amended from time to time.

The disclosures and presentations made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated 22 March 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021 except for the change explained in note 3.1 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 3.1 Change in accounting policy of land and building from cost to revaluation model

With effect from 30 June 2022, the Bank has voluntarily changed its accounting policy for land and buildings (freehold and leasehold) from the cost model to the revaluation model, as permitted under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ (IAS16). On adoption, these are carried at a revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any), which previously were carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). The impact of the change in accounting policy has been disclosed in note 11.3.

The management believes that the new accounting policy will result in the financial statements providing more relevant information and a more realistic reflection of the values of these assets. The change has been dealt in accordance with the requirements of IAS 16, and accordingly, the Bank has applied the accounting policy prospectively.

Fixed assets other than land and buildings are carried in accordance with the accounting policy consistent to those applied in the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

In view of the above, the revised accounting policy of the Bank for Properties and Equipment is as follows: Fixed assets are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amounts, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). Land and capital work-in progress are not depreciated. Other items included in fixed assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation on additions is charged from the day on which the assets are available for use and up to the day in which the assets are disposed off.


14



lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and building account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognized in the profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognized in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of land and building account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset.

Surplus on revaluation of land and building (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realized on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 3.2 Amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current period

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2022. These are considered either not to be relevant or not to have any significant impact on these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 16

# 3.3 New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular Letter no. 03 dated 05 July 2022, the applicability of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments has been deferred to accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2023. Certain requirements of this standard will be applicable from 01 January 2024. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 on the Bank's financial statements is being assessed.

There are various amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective. These are not likely to have a material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.

# 5. RISK MANAGEMENT

The risk management policies adopted by the bank are consistent with those disclosed in the audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

In accordance with BSD Circular No. 1 of 21 October 2011 issued by the SBP, the Bank has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collateral against non-performing loans and advances.

This amount of Rs. 153,580 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand) is not available for distribution of cash and stock dividend to the shareholders and bonus to employees.

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions, the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 21 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Bank deals in derivative financial instruments namely forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps with the principal view of hedging the risks arising from its trade business.

As per the Bank’s policy, these contracts are reported on their fair values at the statement of financial position date. The gains and losses from revaluation of these contracts are included under “income from dealing in foreign currencies”. Unrealised mark-to-market gains and losses due on these contracts are recorded on the statement of financial position under “other assets / other liabilities”.

These products are offered to the Bank’s customers to protect from unfavourable movements in foreign currencies. The Bank hedges such exposures in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. These positions are reviewed on a regular basis by the Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO).

# 32. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investments in subsidiaries and those classified as held-to-maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 65

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 32.3 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

Debt securities other than federal government securities: The fair value is determined using the prices / rates available on Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) / Reuters website.

Forward contracts: The fair values are derived using forward exchange rates applicable to their respective remaining maturities.

Mutual funds: The fair value is determined based on the net asset values published at the close of each business day.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP), as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) from time to time.

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of the IAS 34 or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP vide BSD Circular No. 10, dated 26 August 2002 has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" and IAS 40 "Investment Property" for banking companies till further instructions. Further, according to a notification of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) through S.R.O. No. 411 (1) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008, IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" has not been made applicable for banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements of various circulars issued by the SBP.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan. IFAS 3 shall be followed with effect from the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in respect of accounting for transactions relating to 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' as defined by the said standard. The standard has resulted in certain new disclosures in the financial statements of the Bank.

The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions and prescribed the Banks to prepare their annual and periodical financial statements as per existing prescribed formats issued vide BPRD Circular 2 of 2018, as amended from time to time.




The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated 22 March 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

## Chunk 100

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICY

The significant accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 except for the change explained in note 3.1 to these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

---

## Chunk 101

# 3.1 Revaluation of Land and Building

With effect from 30 June 2022, the group has voluntarily changed its accounting policy for land and buildings (freehold and leasehold) from the cost model to the revaluation model, as permitted under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ (IAS 16). On adoption, these are carried at a revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any), which previously were carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). The impact of the change in accounting policy has been disclosed in note 11.3.

The management believes that the new accounting policy will result in the financial statements providing more relevant information and a more realistic reflection of the values of these assets.

The change has been dealt in accordance with the requirements of IAS 16, and accordingly, the group has applied the accounting policy prospectively.

Fixed assets other than land and buildings are carried in accordance with the accounting policy consistent to those applied in the preparation of consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

In view of the above, the revised accounting policy of the group for Properties and Equipment is as follows:

Fixed assets are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amounts, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). Land and capital work-in progress are not depreciated. Other items included in fixed assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation on additions is charged from the day on which the assets are available for use and up to the day in which the assets are disposed off. The useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and building account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognized in the profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognized in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of land and building account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset.




Surplus on revaluation of land and building (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realized on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 18.2

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the holding company is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The holding company has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the holding company maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 32. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

## Chunk 155

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.
