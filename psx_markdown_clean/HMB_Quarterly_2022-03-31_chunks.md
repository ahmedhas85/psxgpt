# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank, I am pleased to present the condensed interim un-audited financial statements for the quarter ended 31 March 2022.

The quarter under review concluded with uncertainty on the domestic political front. Moreover, on international front, the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in higher commodity prices, and with growing inflation, the global financial conditions appear to be tightening.

Local inflationary pressure continues to rise due to risks of external instability, average inflation for 9MFY22 clocked in at 12.7% as compared to 9.1% in the same period last year. Going forward, global commodity prices, including oil, are likely to remain elevated. Average inflation forecasts have been revised upwards in FY22 and are expected to show some relieve in FY23.

Current account deficit rose to USD 12.1 billion in 8MFY22 as compared to USD 0.9 billion in the same period last year. However timely demand-moderating measures and strong exports and remittances contributed to current account deficit shrink to USD 0.5 billion in February, its lowest level this fiscal year. Remittances remained strong, growing by 7.1 percent YoY during the 9MFY22 with an average of USD 2.5 billion per month. Exports performed well, and reached USD 25.1 billion with a 26.2 percent growth YoY. However, the increase in imports exceeded the growth in remittances and exports.

Country imports depicted a 47.8 percent increase in the period under review and reached USD 54.9 billion. Resultantly the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) net foreign exchange reserves have reduced to USD 16.4 billion.

PKR depreciated by 16 percent in 9M FY22 to PKR 183.5 to USD.

In order to manage external account and price stability, the SBP decided to raise the policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25 percent in its monetary policy meeting held on 07th April, 2022.

While the above challenges persists, however, by the Grace of Allah, HabibMetro's posted profit after tax for the quarter ended 31 March 2022 amounting to Rs. 3,584 million, an increase of 11.1 percent compared to Rs 3,226 million in the same period last year. This translates into after tax earnings per share of Rs. 3.42 per share.

The Bank's net mark-up income amounted to Rs. 7,736 million with a growth of 4.9 percent whereas non-markup income increased by 54.7 percent amounting to Rs. 3,346 million as compared to Rs. 2,162 million during the same period last year.

Investments remained near December 2021 level and amounted to Rs. 664,534 million whereas Advances grew by 7.6 percent and amounted to Rs. 428,515 million during the period under review. Meanwhile, deposits remained around December 2021 level at Rs. 773,709 million. The Bank continues to focus on low cost deposit mobilization - as a result of which, current deposits increased by 10 percent during the period under review to Rs. 294,579 million with an increased CA mix of 38.1 percent.

# 2.1

These unconsolidated financial statements represent separate financial statements of the Bank. The consolidated financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies are being separately issued.

---

## Chunk 12

# 2.2 Statement of Compliance

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP), as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) from time to time.

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of the IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP vide BSD Circular No. 10, dated 26 August 2002 has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" and IAS 40 "Investment Property" for banking companies till further instructions. Further, according to a notification of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) through S.R.O. No. 411 (1) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008, IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" has not been made applicable for banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements of various circulars issued by the SBP.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan.



Pakistan
IFAS 3 shall be followed with effect from the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in respect of accounting for transactions relating to 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' as defined by the said standard. The standard has resulted in certain new disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank. The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions and prescribed the Banks to prepare their annual and periodical financial statements as per existing prescribed formats issued vide BPRD Circular 02 of 2018, as amended from time to time. The disclosures and presentation made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated 22 March 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements, and these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021.

## Chunk 13

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021.

---

## Chunk 14

# 3.1 Standards, Interpretations and Amendments to Published Approved Accounting Standards that are effective in current period

There are certain new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements except for the following:

'IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and amendment – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation – As per State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’BPRD Circular Letter No. 24 of 2021, IFRS 9‘Financial Instruments’is applicable to banks/DFIs/MFBs effective 1 January 2022. The standard replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.

The aforementioned SBP circular letter contained instructions for quarterly parallel reporting purposes to the SBP only and it was stated that final instructions will be issued based on the results of parallel reporting. However, banks have submitted their reservations on instructions issued for parallel reporting through the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) and requested that they are addressed in the final instructions to be issued. The reservations are pervasive and points of contention inter alia include, retaining some relaxations given presently in the Prudential Regulations, prescription of macro-economic variables, retaining local regulatory requirements related to IFRS 9 related areas on overseas branches, impact on capital adequacy ratio, adequacy of significant increase in credit risk criteria, future tax impact of any reversals, recording of expected credit loss on local currency denominated Government securities, together with further clarifications required in certain areas. Due to the fact that final instructions have not yet been issued and the reservations shared by the industry over the draft instructions are still to be addressed, the impact of application of IFRS 9 on Bank's financial statements is presently being assessed. Banks are collectively of the opinion that impact on initial application of IFRS 9 will only be reasonably estimated subsequent to issuance of final application guidelines by SBP.

## Chunk 15

# 3.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

There are various standards, interpretations and amendments to accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan that are not yet effective in the current year. These are not likely to have a material effect on the Bank's unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

## Chunk 16

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are the same as that applied in the preparation of the audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

# 5. RISK MANAGEMENT

The risk management policies adopted by the bank are consistent with those disclosed in the audited unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

# 10.3.3 Consideration of forced sales value (FSV) for the purposes of provisioning against non-performing loans

In accordance with BSD Circular No. 1 of 21 October 2011 issued by the SBP, the Bank has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collateral against non-performing loans and advances. Had this benefit of FSV not been taken by the Bank, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 268,954 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 208,257 thousand) and profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 164,062 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand). This amount of Rs.164,062 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand) is not available for distribution of cash and stock dividend to the shareholders and bonus to employees.

# 18.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 20.3.2 Foreign exchange repatriation case

While adjudicating foreign exchange repatriation cases of exporters, the Foreign Exchange Adjudicating Court of the State Bank of Pakistan has adjudicated penalty of Rs. 106,056 thousand, arbitrarily on the Bank. The Bank has filed appeals before the Appellate Board and Constitutional Petitions in the Honorable High Court of Sindh against the said judgment. The Honorable High Court has granted relief to Bank by way of interim orders. Based on merits of the appeals management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 32. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment in subsidiaries and those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 64

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

---

## Chunk 65

# Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

# Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements comprise the financial statements of the holding company and its subsidiary companies. The financial statements of the subsidiary companies have been prepared for the same reporting period as the holding company using consistent accounting policies.

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic mode, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. Key financial figures of the Islamic banking branches of the holding company are disclosed in note 36 to these consolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 113

# 2.2 Statement of Compliance

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan, as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of the IAS 34 or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP vide BSD Circular No. 10, dated 26 August 2002 has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" and IAS 40 "Investment Property" for banking companies till further instructions. Further, according to a notification of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) through S.R.O. No. 411 (1) / 2008 dated 28 April 2008, IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" has not been made applicable for banks. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements of various circulars issued by the SBP.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has notified Islamic Financial Accounting Standard (IFAS) 3, 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan. IFAS 3 shall be followed with effect from the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 in respect of accounting for transactions relating to 'Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits' as defined by the said standard. The standard has resulted in certain new disclosures in the financial statements of the holding company.


The SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 4 dated 25 February 2015, has deferred the applicability of IFAS 3 till further instructions and prescribed the Banks to prepare their annual and periodical financial statements as per existing prescribed formats issued vide BPRD Circular 02 of 2018, as amended from time to time.


The disclosures and presentation made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 5 dated 22 March 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all the disclosures required for annual financial statements, and these consolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICY

The significant accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021.

## Chunk 115

# 3.1 Standards, Interpretations and Amendments to Published Approved Accounting Standards that are effective in current period

There are certain other new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Group's accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Group's operations and therefore not detailed in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements except for the following:

IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and amendment – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation – As per State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’ BPRD Circular Letter No. 24 of 2021, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is applicable to banks/DFIs/MFBs effective 1 January 2022. The standard replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.

The aforementioned SBP circular letter contained instructions for quarterly parallel reporting purposes to the SBP only and it was stated that final instructions will be issued based on the results of parallel reporting. However, banks have submitted their reservations on instructions issued for parallel reporting through the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) and requested that they are addressed in the final instructions to be issued. The reservations are pervasive and points of contention inter alia include, retaining some relaxations given presently in the Prudential Regulations, prescription of macro-economic variables, retaining local regulatory requirements related to IFRS 9 related areas on overseas branches, impact on capital adequacy ratio, adequacy of significant increase in credit risk criteria, future tax impact of any reversals, recording of expected credit loss on local currency denominated Government securities, together with further clarifications required in certain areas. Due to the fact that final instructions have not yet been issued and the reservations shared by the industry over the draft instructions are still to be addressed, the impact of application of IFRS 9 on Bank's financial statements is presently being assessed. Banks are collectively of the opinion that impact on initial application of IFRS 9 will only be reasonably estimated subsequent to issuance of final application guidelines by SBP.

# 10.4.3 Consideration of forced sales value (FSV) for the purposes of provisioning against non-performing loans

In accordance with BSD Circular No. 1 of 21 October 2011 issued by the SBP, the holding company has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collateral against non-performing loans and advances. Had this benefit of FSV not been taken by the Bank, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 268,954 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 208,257 thousand) and profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 164,062 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand). This amount of Rs.164,062 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand) is not available for distribution of cash and stock dividend to the shareholders and bonus to employees.

# 18.2 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the holding company is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The holding company has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions, the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the holding company maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

| The fair value of quoted securities other than investment those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. |               |               |
| The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.                                               |               |               |
| The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.                                                                                                       |               |               |

| The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |               |               |
| Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |               |               |

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
