# About the Report

# Adoption and Statement of Adherence with the International Integrated Reporting Framework

In the course of its operations, a commercial organization receives various inputs and converts them into value for itself and its stakeholders. This value creation can be over different time frames; short, medium and long term. An integrated report describes this value creation process concisely including the business model, strategies, governance, processes, risks and opportunities.

MCB is one of the largest Commercial Banks in the country and plays a vital role in the economy through its presence at the grassroot level with a sprawling network of branches and a wide customer base. Therefore, MCB has a socio-economic impact that extends far beyond its bottom line; making it imperative for the Bank to reassure its stakeholders that all public interest stands adequately safeguarded.

Adoption of International Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework depends on the individual circumstances of an entity. The Bank has adopted the IR Framework to give an overview of Bank’s philosophy and to explain the connection between its financial and non-financial information; which would enhance user’s understanding as to how the Bank is continuously adopting to improve its performance keeping in view various stakeholder interests.

IR framework is still considered to be a practice in its early stages. We will continue to improve the information produced to make it even easier to understand; while taking into account valuable opinion of stakeholders reading this report.

## Chunk 6

# Key Concepts

- Materiality and material matters
The Bank applies the principle of materiality in assessing what information should be included in its integrated report. This report therefore focuses particularly on those issues, opportunities and challenges that impact materially on MCB and its ability to be a sustainable business that consistently delivers value to shareholders and key stakeholders. Identifying our potential material matters is a bank wide responsibility and requires input from all business units and divisions and an assessment of the risks and opportunities in our operating environment.
- Our CAPITALs
Our relevance as a bank today and in the future and our ability to create long-term value are interrelated and fundamentally dependent on the forms of capital available to us (inputs), how we use them (value-adding activities), our impact on them and the value we deliver (outputs and outcomes).

# Chairman’s Review

I am pleased to present this report to the shareholders of MCB Bank Limited on the effectiveness of the role played by the Board and overall performance of the Board of Directors in achieving Bank’s strategic objectives.

The Board set the Bank’s strategic aims to uphold and oversee the implementation of our vision, mission and core values. It demonstrated high standards of business and professional conduct in supervising and managing the affairs of the Bank. During 2022, the Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (‘PICG’), as an external independent evaluator conducted the performance evaluation of the Board as a whole, its Committees and individual Board Members for the Year 2021.

The Board has always focused to guard the best interests of the Bank’s shareholders. As part of this effort, the Board’s properly structured Committees are in place, with each one having well-defined objectives and appropriate Terms of Reference; performing their respective roles effectively and efficiently.

An effective Board and highly professional management team has served the Bank and its shareholders well, especially in a challenging operating environment. Geo-political disturbances had negative ramifications for regional economies including Pakistan with impact of elevated commodity prices, supply constraints and surging energy costs.

Political stability remains a key for management of national affairs, attracting foreign investment, sustainable economic growth and effective long term structured planning & development. Stability in this all-important area will be invaluable for building trust with foreign investors and key external stakeholders, and help to ensure that our economy can effectively meet prevailing and new economic challenges with unity and cohesion.

Despite macroeconomic conditions, the Bank achieved growth and posted an impressive Profit Before Tax (PBT) of PKR 71.4 billion, its highest ever. The Bank also rewarded the trust of our investors and shareholders through a declaration of a total cash dividend of 200% for 2022. MCB Bank is strategically positioned and adequately placed to pursue new opportunities of growth and leverage prevailing economic conditions to our advantage. We continue to invest and innovate in our people and systems, so our customers and stakeholders may benefit from state-of-the-art banking services that provide convenience and quick access that meets their every need. We are proud to have a diverse product portfolio that features conventional and tailor-made solutions for every financing requirement. The Bank also continued its journey of digital transformation with a view to meeting the pressing demands and needs of an increasingly digitalized financial sector.

2022 has been another remarkable year for all of us in MCB Bank. Our unwavering strategic focus and resilience was reflected not only in our financial performance but also in the continued trust of our growing and loyal customer base. I am grateful to our customers, management, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders for their faith in our abilities and their collaboration on different projects which has significantly contributed to our progress. Your support and encouragement motivates us to achieve even greater heights of success. Despite challenges that the national economy is facing, we are optimistic for what’s yet to come and look to the future with hope and enthusiasm.

President’s Review

The Global economy, and disproportionately more so developing countries, were severely affected in 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Already battling with the repercussions of extended Covid lockdowns the world over, developing economies faced extensive challenges by way of large-scale disruptions in global supply chains, soaring energy and commodity prices- being priced out by the larger nations, and consequently ever-increasing global inflation. Pakistan was no exception. Imbibed by ever increasing political unrest the country and the business environment suffered large setbacks.

However, as the old adage goes that one’s strength is revealed through trials and tribulations, and so it was for the Bank, as it continued to demonstrate its resilience and adaptability. On the back of a well-defined and dynamic strategy, the Bank delivered historic growth in our profitability matrices.

We believe that our strength lies with our commitment to our customer and in turn our stakeholder’s trust on the business acumen, professionalism and dedication of our team of talented professionals.

With a strong build up in core earnings the Bank reported its highest Profit Before Tax Earnings of Rs. 71.4 Billion (+37%) and declared a 200% cash dividend for the year 2022. Assets of the Bank grew by 6% over the previous year to Rs. 2.1 Trillion. Average current deposits of the Bank registered a highest ever growth of Rs. 96.8 Billion (+18%) in 2022, on the back of strategically focused drive. Similarly, the net interest income increased to Rs. 87 Billion registering an impressive increase of 36% on account of strong volumetric growth in current deposits and favorable yield curve movements. The fee, commission, and brokerage income of the bank registered a growth of 14% whereas dividend and foreign exchange revenue streams increased by 7% and 145% respectively. Despite exceptional inflationary pressures, the Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base with an increase of 17% over last year. Return on Assets and Return on Equity were reported at 1.61% and 19.78%, respectively.

Our lending growth has been the highest in our Bank’s history. The gross advances of the Bank registered historic growth of Rs. 162 Billion (+25%), exceeding industry wide growth levels, to close the year at Rs. 798 Billion. The corporate lending book grew by Rs. 161 Billion (+36%) whereas the consumer loan portfolio increased by Rs. 4.5 Billion (+12%).

Flow of remittances through banking channels is an important contributor to the national cause. During the year 2022, MCB Bank attracted home remittance inflows of USD 3.4 Billion, increasing its market share from 11.4% to 11.6%. The Bank also facilitated overseas Pakistanis under the RDA initiative where the total inflows for the year 2022 summed up to USD 203 Million. Further, as one of the leading Banks in cash management, MCB Bank’s annual throughput during the year increased to Rs. 3.9 Trillion. In 2022, our cards spend increased by 74% whereas acquiring volume grew by 63%.

In 2022, achieving growth in a no-cost current account base remained a key strategic objective of the Bank. Non-remunerative deposits grew by 21% to close at Rs. 680 Billion; improving their mix in total deposits to 49% in absolute terms as of December 31, 2022. Current Account-Savings Account (CASA) concentration was reported at 96% an all-time high whereas the total deposits of the Bank were reported at Rs. 1.37 Trillion.

Our capital coverage is at industry-leading levels, well over the minimum thresholds established by the regulator. We continue to prudently manage risk throughout the Bank while maintaining a strong risk management culture. We recognize the risk around money laundering, cyber security and continue to develop systems, controls, and infrastructure to minimize, mitigate and combat them. The Bank has made exceptional efforts in reducing the number and amount of delinquent assets with continuing improvements in credit quality across consumer, commercial and corporate portfolios.

MCB serves our valued customers across Pakistan, UAE, Bahrain, and Sri Lanka through our expansive network of 1,448 branches. The Bank, through its wholly owned subsidiary MCB Islamic Bank Limited, remained active in satisfying customers’ growing banking needs by valuing their faith in conformity with Shari’ah rulings. The Bank together with its subsidiary MCB Islamic Bank is operating the 2nd largest network of branches in Pakistan. In 2022, our Customer Base grew to 8.6 million accounts demonstrating our customer’s confidence in MCB. We continue to offer accessible banking infrastructure for differently-abled persons to support equitable access to banking and financial services.

# In 2022

while successfully completing 75 years of banking services to the nation, the Bank has transformed into a dynamic and innovative organization; overcoming a multitude of challenges along the way with resolve and fortitude. Surpassing the traditional norms of growth, MCB’s Digital Platform “MCB Live” has grown to become one of the most comprehensive, stable and flexible payment ecosystems.

This was only possible due to our focused strategy to expand our service offerings and delivery to our customers while being preemptive about prevailing industry risks. Our commitment to improve our conduct and controls is factored into every strategic and operational decision we make. We make no compromise on customer data security and remain engaged in raising awareness about cyber-security and malicious activities. Against cyber-crime, we at MCB are in practice of protecting electronic information by mitigating information risks and vulnerabilities.

These efforts to improve internal operational environment of MCB Bank were aptly recognized at different forums. Strength of our Bank was also reassured by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA), which maintained its credit ratings at AAA [Triple A] for long term and A1+ [A one plus] for short term, respectively. The Bank’s exceptional performance was recognized by the globally coveted Asiamoney which declared MCB Bank as the “Best Corporate Bank in Pakistan” in 2022. The Annual report of MCB Bank was also adjudged 1st (joint winner) by the committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan & Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP/ICMAP) in the financial sector category. MCB has won this award 12 times in the last 13 years with 10 consecutive wins.

In closing, I believe that our results demonstrate that we are on the right track and we have the right talent in place to deliver consistent value for our stakeholders. I extend my heartiest gratitude to the Chairman and Board of Directors for their vision, foresight and guidance for making 2022 yet another profitable year. I would also like to thank State Bank of Pakistan and other regulatory bodies for their continued support, our shareholders for their trust and belief in us. Last but not the least, I share my appreciation for the management and staff of MCB for their impressive teamwork, unity of purpose and faith in God in translating our hard work into reality.

# Forward Looking Statement

The Annual Report of MCB Bank Limited carries forward looking statements in its different sections; since there are uncertainties related to the occurrence of future events, these should be read in conjunction for decision making by the users of the Annual Report. Forward looking statements contain words such as expect, anticipate, believe, seek, will, may, would, presume, assure, hope, so on and so forth. A forward-looking statement naturally addresses matters that are, to certain degrees, uncertain and may not happen. In most cases, a forward-looking statement is made in respect of Bank’s expected income, earnings, business growth, horizontal expansion, cost structure, capital structure, dividends etc.

## Chunk 35

# Pakistan’s Economic Outlook

The country continues to counter challenging economic conditions. An already precarious economic situation of low foreign exchange (FX) reserves, large fiscal and external imbalances, persisting policy and political uncertainty and elevated inflationary pressures has been further exacerbated by the severe flooding that has affected more than one-third of the country’s land area and pushed approximately 9 million people into poverty.

For the fiscal year 2023, downside risks to the country’s earlier envisaged baseline growth outlook have increased and the real sector growth is now being projected to recede to 2%; as the economic activity witnesses broad based and sustained moderation in response to exogenous shocks and Government of Pakistan’s (GoP) policy measures for stabilizing macroeconomic conditions.

On the external front, near term challenges have increased despite the policy-induced contraction in the current account deficit. Depleting FX reserves, delay in realization of official financial inflows, surging debt repayments, plummeting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and rallying global commodity prices are causing stress to the external account.

The outlook hence remains uncertain and largely dependent on the eventual path of possible economic & geopolitical scenarios, improvement in global financial conditions, political outcome of 2023 general elections and successful completion of the pending 9th review under IMF’s extended fund facility (EFF) program; which remains critical to reducing the ensuing uncertainty and unlocking other multilateral and bilateral inflows.

# MCB’s Future Outlook

Pakistan’s banking sector is expected to face headwinds in 2023, on the back of slowing economic growth and rising interest rates impacting quality of assets.

However, the Bank through its focus on customer centricity and aided by a strong digital transformation drive, is expected to perform well in these economically challenging times.

To supplement the core deposit drive, the Bank will focus on conversion of Home Remittances, soliciting quality NTBs, retention / deepening of existing deposits, on-boarding Cash Management, Collection and Payroll & Mandates.

Disciplined implementation of policies and procedures in ensuring compliance and control culture along with creation of operational efficiencies shall remain focus areas.

Annual Report 2022
We would continue to improve our asset quality. Credit appetite being a mainstream business line of the Bank, instigates us to avail all righteous credit extension opportunities that fall within the defined risk appetite of the institution; while proactively monitoring watch listed portfolio of the bank to minimize any further infection and ensure that recoveries are made in line with the agreements.

On the investments side, the Bank is committed to optimally manage excess liquidity through strategic re-profiling of the investment book in an evolving yield curve scenario.

Digital transformation is imperative to support enhanced customer experiences deducible from adoption of advanced e-banking avenues. The Bank’s transformation strategy is focused on technology, processes, data analytics led transformation and more importantly, changing the entire culture within the Bank towards more technology driven solutions in day-to-day operations. We would continue to lead the market position through focused initiatives encompassing launch of innovative and customer centric solutions, penetration of emerging markets, adoption of digital banking avenues and instilling effective cost management techniques. The Bank is also investing in developing a workforce for the ‘Digital Banking Age’ by attracting and retaining the right skillset and competence; hence, aligning it with the evolving business dynamics. MCB has initiated the process of establishing a digital-based consumer asset management service platform for individual customers to provide enriched customer experience along with reduced turn-around-time. The Bank is geared up to launch MCB eStore, a product line extension of eGate, that will offer easy onboarding to small & medium sized businesses intending to start online business.

Driving customer centricity remains a key area of focus for the next year; we will direct investments towards empowering employees to drive a pleasant service experience across all customer touch points. Also, through capacity and skills enhancement programs for the employees, we will continue emphasizing the need for the staff to serve customers as a means of consolidating our position as the most sought after bank in the industry. To sum up, employees’ development and trainings would remain at the forefront of our strategic focus. We would acutely remain conscious in attracting and retaining the best talent pool in the industry.

We are committed in maintaining our unique positioning, of diversified financial institution with a robust heritage and strong reputation, through enriched service offerings and financially viable products tailored to meet requirements of our esteemed customers; hence, enabling us to serve both our existing and next-generation customers in the coming years while simultaneously translating the underlying financial strength of the entity into profits.

# Quantitative Projections

# Outlook

Deposit mobilization to exceed growth level achieved in 2022.

Net Interest Margin (NIM) to increase from the 2022 level.

Non Markup Income to achieve double digit growth.

Expenses growth to be contained at a modest level.

CET1 ratio to be adequately kept within prescribed regulatory limits.

Minimizing credit infection and realizing recoveries in line with contractual stipulations.

## Chunk 39

# Key Risks Going Forward

Increased competition within the industry for mobilizing deposits amidst low differentiation and switching costs; leading to an inability to capitalize on the expected increase in industry deposit base on the back of increasing interest rates.

Risk of slower than expected deposit mobilization and advances growth; increase in net interest margin not realized in line with the expected yield curve movements.

Risk of lower than anticipated growth as transactional volumes decline due to slow down in market activities amidst moderating domestic demand and imposition of additional taxes on financial/banking transactions as a fiscal consolidation measure.

Risk of cost-push pressures emanating from currency devaluation, higher commodity prices and elevated inflationary pressures to translate into higher than expected growth in expenditures. However, the Bank remains committed to managing expenditures through rationalization of discretionary spend and inculcation of operational efficiencies through business process automation and implementation of strong budgetary controls.

Higher Risk Weighted Assets (RWA’s).

Moderation in credit growth and increased risks to asset quality due to slowdown in economic activity.

Regulatory restrictions impacting dividend payout.

# Uncertainties that could affect Bank’s Resources, Revenues and Operations

All forward-looking statements are, by nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond control. Major factors that can affect Bank’s resources, revenues and operations are given below:

Discount rate / Monetary Policy: Based on different assessment parameters, the State Bank of Pakistan may change the monetary policy rate. Any further increase in the discount rate will initially have an adverse impact on Bank’s net interest income due to the repricing lag between earning assets and liabilities. However, as the rate stabilizes, the net interest margins will improve and have a positive impact on Bank’s profitability.

The impact of interest rate sensitivity on the banks profitability has been disclosed in note 45.2.4 of the financial statements.

Inflation: Inflation is considered to be a key determinant of the policy rate change. Any uptick in inflation statistics will have a material impact on the monetary policy stance along with other drivers.

# Political Stability & Law and order situation:

Political stability and controlled law & order situation is a pre-requisite for any economy. This, in turn, reposes investor confidence in the soils of Pakistan, making our corporates a potential investment opportunity. However, any act of terrorism or political instability can negatively impact the economy/equity market, thus resulting in decreased profitability.

# Corporate Tax rate:

Any increase in the corporate tax rate or imposition of an additional tax will adversely impact the profitability of the Bank.

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has further accentuated the need on banks to expedite digital adoption required for reshaping the banking services architecture in Pakistan; the transformation is imperative to support enhanced customer experiences deducible from the adoption of advanced e-banking avenues.

We would continue to improve our asset quality, increase low cost deposit base, inculcate operational efficiencies across the entire spectrum, diversify revenue streams through continuous enrichment of service suite and leverage cross sell business opportunities with corporate client relationships to increase contribution from non-markup segment.

Credit appetite being a mainstream business line of the Bank, instigates us to avail all righteous credit extension opportunities that fall within the defined risk appetite of the institution; while proactively monitoring watch listed portfolio of the bank to minimize any further infection and ensure that recoveries are made in line with the agreements.

# Sources of Information and Assumptions used for Projections and Forecast

The Bank gathers and compiles internal business data, external economic indicators and industry specific analysis from various sources and utilizes in-house developed tools and functional expertise to process these items through a calculation; in turn laying the foundation for its operational and financial forecasts and projections.

The Bank assumes further tightening of the monetary policy stance, by the State Bank of Pakistan, in order to anchor country’s inflationary outlook and keep real interest rates at the appropriate level to support growth and maintain external stability. With respect to PKR parity, we expect the currency to devalue further, owing particularly to the country’s weak balance of payments position.

The non-markup income block of the Bank was reported at Rs. 24.613 billion; with major contributions coming in from fee & commission, foreign exchange and dividend income.

# Net Interest Income

# Quarter 1

During the 1st quarter of 2022, Net Interest Income (NII) of the Bank increased by 19% and was reported at Rs. 18.112 billion. The markup income was concentrated by markup from investments which amounted to Rs. 26.866 billion and constituted 68% of the gross amount while the markup income from advances was reported at Rs. 12.409 billion. The increase in gross markup income was broad based; driven by improving earning margins, in an upward sloping yield curve, and volumetric growth achieved in earning assets.

Non Markup Income for the 1st quarter of 2022 was reported at Rs. 5.722 billion against Rs. 4.749 billion reported in the corresponding period; representing an increase of 20%. The growth is mainly attributable to rise in foreign exchange income (94%) on the back of prudent positioning of foreign exchange assets and liabilities amidst comparatively favorable swap curves and growth in dividend income (81%) due to resurging economic activity in the country.

Non Markup expenses grew by 10% in the 1st quarter of 2022 over the corresponding period. Despite surge in inflationary pressures, the Bank was able to contain growth in the operating expense base through cost management initiatives and continuous process revamping for inculcating operational efficiencies.

On the provision front, disposal of equity scrips resulted in a net reversal of Rs. 187 million recognized during the period in review while proactive monitoring and recovery efforts led to a reversal of Rs. 616 million in provision against advances.

Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the 1st quarter of 2022 resultantly grew by 32% to reach Rs. 14.928 million.

## Chunk 80

# Quarter 2

NII during the 2nd quarter of 2022 was reported at Rs. 20.876 billion; growing by 28% as compared to the corresponding period. NII improved during the second quarter 2022 due to strong volumetric growth in current account and favorable yield curve movements (Average policy rate during the quarter in review stood at 12.68% against 7% in the comparative period).

Non Mark up Income for the 2nd quarter of 2022 was reported at Rs. 7.177 billion; posting a rise of 51% over the corresponding period. Major variance pertained to FX income; increasing by Rs. 2.132 billion and translating into a growth of 277%. Fee and commission income increased by 29%, gain on securities increased by 87% while dividend income and other income decreased by 11% and 90% respectively.

Non Markup expenses grew by 14% in the 2nd quarter of 2022. Major contribution to the increase transpired from non HR related operating expenses; that witnessed a broad based surge (28%) owing to elevated inflationary pressures amidst economic turbulence and geopolitical uncertainty.

NIM and non mark up income increased by Rs. 4.567 billion and Rs. 2.426 billion respectively. The increase in gross income was slightly offset by rise in non mark up expenses and provision charge amounting to Rs. 2.427 billion and Rs. 1.239 billion respectively. Net impact of captioned variances resulted in increase in PBT for the quarter in review.

Retrospective application of tax amendments along with higher tax rates for current period enacted through Finance Act, 2022 resulted into a significantly higher tax charge for the quarter as in review as compared to the corresponding period. Hence, Profit After Tax (PAT) registered a decline of 72% to report at Rs. 2.21 billion.

## Chunk 81

# Quarter 3

NII during the 3rd quarter was reported at Rs. 22.523 billion; 39% higher compared to the corresponding period of 2021. Mark up earned increased by 75% on the back of rising earning yields in an upward sloping yield curve. Mark up income on investments and advances contributed 73% and 26% to the captioned increase respectively.

Non mark up income registered a significant growth of 51% over the comparative period to report at Rs. 7.355 billion. Prudent positioning of foreign currency assets amidst sustained volatility in the FOREX market resulted in FX income growing by Rs. 2.919 billion (312%).

On the expense side, mark up expense increased by 113% primarily on account of higher deposit mobilization and increase in minimum saving rate applicable during the quarter in review. Capital loss on securities was reported at Rs. 572.548 million as compared to a capital gain of Rs. 218.840 million in the corresponding period.

On the back of strong overall performance (39% growth in NII and 51% growth in non markup income), the Bank reported quarterly profit before tax of Rs. 19.051 billion in the 3rd quarter of 2022.

## Chunk 82

# Quarter 4

On the back of an evolving yield curve scenario, record growth in Bank's credit book and materialization of strategic drive undertaken to improve concentration of current accounts in the deposit mix, the last quarter of the year witnessed an impressive growth of 58% in NII.

Non Mark up Income posted a decline of 24% to report at Rs. 4.360 billion for the 4th quarter of 2022. Prime contributories to the declining trend were:

- (i) increase in capital loss on securities realized from the sale of underperforming equity scrips amidst weak PSX performance; amounting to Rs. 1.464 billion
- (ii) decrease in FX income; amounting to Rs. 214 million
- (iii) decrease in dividend income; amounting to Rs. 83 million.

Non markup expenses closed the period in line with the surging trend witnessed during the first three quarters of 2022; posting a growth of 23% to report at Rs. 11.691 billion.

During the last quarter of 2022, the Bank registered a significant growth of 44% in its profit before tax to post Rs. 19.778 billion compared to Rs. 13.719 billion posted in the comparative period. Total income increased by 37% on the back of a registered increase of 58% in NII. The increase was slightly offset by a decline of 24% in non markup income and a rise of 23% rise in non markup expenses.

Prime contributors to the said increase have been advances and investments; with investments growing annually by approximately 8.30% while the advances book has recorded a growth of 9.14% on an annual basis. The earning asset mix of the Bank has been prudently and proactively managed to ensure maximization of returns to the stakeholders. In 2017, on account of merger with NIB Bank, MCB’s asset base increased significantly; to the tune of 25%. However, in 2018, the high base impact was slightly diluted by the transfer of 90 branches of the Bank to its wholly owned subsidiary i.e. MCB Islamic Bank Limited. Since then, the asset base of the Bank has grown consistently to generate a sustainable return on assets (RoA).

environment, to effectively identify, evaluate and mitigate all risks undertaken in the achievement of its long-term strategic objectives. The captioned platform has formed the basis for a declining trend in provision charge booked against advances over the years; in fact, with exception of year 2020, the Bank has been able to post significant provision reversals on the back of extensive recovery efforts undertaken.

During 2020, the Bank has witnessed a trend reversal in recognition of provision against advances. The subjective classification of obligor accounts on a prudent basis coupled with an additional recognition of general provision charge, amounting to Rs. 4 billion, in anticipation of the impact realization of COVID-19 pandemic post expiration of SBP’s relaxations and waivers were the prime contributors to the captioned increase.

During 2021, as part of the continuous credit assessment process, the Bank, while creating specific provisions against exposures that reflected signs of financial distress, reversed the general provision charge created in 2020 as a preemptive measure to counter COVID-19 impact; as the systematic risks surrounding the economic recovery receded. In 2022, proactive monitoring and recovery efforts led to a net provision reversal of Rs. 2.8 billion in specific provision maintained against non-performing loans (NPLs). The Bank has not taken any benefit of FSV in its provision calculation.

The deposit base of the Bank has registered significant growth over the years; increasing from Rs. 968 billion in 2017 to Rs. 1,379 billion in 2022 and translating into a CAGR of 7.32% over the past 6 years. Highest increase has been reported in 2020, primarily on account of splendid volumetric growth. During the year 2018, MCB transferred business of its 90 branches to MCB’s wholly owned subsidiary i.e. MCB Islamic Bank Limited and deposits amounting to Rs. 21.9 billion were transferred under the de-merger scheme. Despite this transfer, the deposits grew by 8.32% in 2018 and have continued on the path of upward trajectory in subsequent years; posting a healthy CAGR of 6.39% from 2019 to 2022.

On the Profit and Loss side, gross markup earned has posted an average increase of 22.06% over a span of six years. This is due to the increase in mark up earned on investments and advances on the back of an ever increasing earning assets base and the evolving yield curve scenarios. The highest gross markup income over the span was reported in 2022; as the double digit policy rate coupled with healthy volumetric gains in the earning assets base contributed to the significant rise. The increase in markup expense on deposits is

# Vertical Analyses

Vertical analysis depicts higher concentration levels of investments and advances in the asset base of the Bank. The advances base of the Bank has grown steadily till 2019. However, the decline in advances witnessed during 2020 due to lack of credit extension opportunities within the Bank’s defined risk appetite and the consequent diversion of excess liquidity towards the investment book had diluted advances concentration in the total asset mix; hence falling to 26% in 2020 from 35% in 2017. In 2021, the V shaped recovery witnessed in key economic sectors laid the foundation for a broad based growth in Bank’s advances; improving concentration of advances in the asset base to 30%. The upward trajectory gained further traction in 2022 and despite a challenging economic environment, the Bank achieved a historic growth of Rs. 162 billion in advances; increasing its concentration in the total asset base to 36%.

Markup income growth has registered a steady rise over the last 6 years, barring the exception of 2021 wherein the earning margins had been adversely impacted by a reversion in yield curve and diluted the impact of volumetric growth achieved in the Bank’s asset base. However, in current year, mark up income has registered a significant growth of 62% primarily on account of improving earning margins due to increase in average policy rate during the year (from an average of 7.28% in 2021 to 13.20% in 2022). The contribution from markup income approximates 89% of the total revenue. Markup expense has increased over the last 6 years based on regulatory revisions enacted over the period and growth registered in the deposit base.

During 2020, the Banking industry steered through challenging economic conditions prevalent due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Timely and well calibrated policy measures rolled out by the SBP facilitated the banking industry to improve profitability, enhance resilience and restrict the credit risk to an acceptable level. However, the accumulation of Deposits was majorly diverted towards investments which resulted in a spike in IDR of the banking industry; MCB’s IDR increased from 49% in 2017 to 58% in 2020.

Following are the main DuPont analysis highlights:

1. Net operating margin reported a significant hike in 2021 on account of reversal in earlier recognized general provision charge as a preemptive measure to counter COVID-19 impact. The year 2022 has witnessed a decline in net operating margins owing primarily to lower reversal in provisions and higher tax consequence of retrospective and additional tax amendments proposed through legislative updates.
2. Asset utilization has increased, in 2022, due to rising total income on account of higher average yield on earning assets.
3. Equity Multiplier has been showing an increasing trend since 2017 due to growing profits.

# Commentary on Cash Flow Statement:

The strategic direction of the Bank to lower its cost of funds, through optimization of the deposit mix, coupled with historic expansion in Bank’s credit book, during the year, orchestrated a trend reversal in activity wise cashflows. Operating cash flows, encompassing cash inflows/(outflows) generated from core activities of the Bank i.e. deposit mobilization and loans & advances disbursement, turned negative as the cash outflows in lieu of loan & advances increased from Rs. 121.9 billion in 2021 to Rs. 161.2 billion in 2022; while the Deposit growth and net borrowings from financial institutions (net off of lending) contributed cash inflows of Rs. 38.4 billion which were utilized mainly to fund growth in Bank’s advances.

The investing activities posted a net-cash inflow as the excess liquidity was diverted towards further augmentation of the credit book; the trend also reflected in Bank’s IDR which fell from 73.35% in 2021 to 71% in 2022. Cash outflow from financing activities primarily reflect payments on account of dividends to the shareholders. The decline in financing cash flows is due to a higher dividend payout base in 2021, since, it accounted for the impact of additional payouts in lieu of dividend distribution that was suspended by SBP in 2020, as a precautionary measure, to conserve capital and enhance liquidity and stress absorption capacity of the banks amidst the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

MCB’s track record of paying the one of the highest dividends per share in the financial sector has meant that the Bank has paid over Rs. 100 billion in quarterly and annual payouts over the last 5 years.

# Share Price Sensitivity Analysis

Factors that can influence the share price of MCB Bank Limited are given below:

# Discount rate / Monetary Policy

Based on different assessment parameters, the State Bank of Pakistan can change the monetary policy rate. Any volatility in the interest rates might impact revenue and profitability of the Bank.

# Minimum Rate of Return on Deposits/Regulatory Risk

Any upward revision in the minimum deposit rate will result in compression in net interest margins earned due to increased cost of deposits. Such revision can negatively impact the earning and correspondingly the share price of the scrip.

---

## Chunk 147

# Inflation

Inflation is considered as a key determinant for policy rate change. Any uptick in the inflation statistics will have a corresponding impact on the monetary policy rate. With higher discount rates, the Banks will be able to invest in high yielding investments, thus resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn will have a positive impact on the share price.

---

## Chunk 148

# Political Stability & Law and order situation

Political stability and controlled law & order situation is a pre-requisite for any economic development. This in turn reposes investor confidence in the soils of Pakistan, making our corporates a potential investment opportunity. However, any act of terrorism or political instability can negatively impact the equity market and share prices of traded stocks.

# Strategies in Place

From customer service standpoint, special focus remains on improving our service quality and service standards levels. We will integrate service standards across all the channels and outlets in the network to provide a uniform customer experience. We will endeavor to meet expectations of our valued customer base. Another important aspect remains credit quality and our refined risk appetite. We will thereby give value to our customers across the entire spectrum of retail, corporate and SME while improving our asset quality.

Under the Corporate plan, we also intend to expand our geographical boundaries by being open to potential new business models, innovative processes and delivery channels, enabling provision of 24x7 customer services. Today, technology is a major component of the competitive edge of any bank. With millennial being an increasing percentage of our customer base, we have to cater to their expectations and it requires leveraging cutting edge technology. The other side of the coin however, is that technology brings risks with it. We will go the extra mile, to ensure our assets and those of our customers are secure and sensitive information is protected.

To ensure efficient and effective operation of the Bank we need systems and processes that operate seamlessly. This is another focus area where we will concentrate on identifying pain points and gaps, and make the necessary modifications. To safeguard the financial stability and the reputation of the Bank, good governance and ethical conduct are imperative. While we already have high standards in these areas, we have set our benchmarks as the best in class practices in the country. We will renew and re-energize our focus on sustainability by ensuring that we continue to maintain a judicious balance between economic, social and environmental objectives.

The end result of all the above will be the enhancement of our brand. The brand is a mirror of our image in the eyes of our customers, both legacy and millennials, and the general public. Through the strategies spelt out in our corporate plan we will forge ahead, building our brand, increasing our assets and profitability, while delivering increasing value to all our stakeholders.

# Method and Assumptions in Compiling Indicators

The Bank identifies its indicators which effectively reflect Bank’s performance. The Bank analyses its market positioning, competitors and general market conditions while compiling its indicators. The Bank analyses deposits, advances, capital and risk adequacy ratios, gross profit after tax and EPS on a regular basis to gauge its performance. These are the basic indicators of Bank’s financial performance and profitability.

Market price is a measure of Bank’s perception in the market. The difference between book value and market value shows investor’s confidence on the script. The Bank manages its dividend payout in line with the profitability generated during the year while ensuring that sufficient capital buffers are available with the institution to meet regulatory requirements. Dividend is the amount allocated out of profit for paying cash to the shareholders. The dividend payment is an indicator of how well earnings support the dividends. The Bank takes its decisions of cash or stock dividend based on market conditions, share price and governing laws and regulations.

Comparing cash flow from operating activities with profit before tax can give insights into how a Bank generates funds and manage the cash flows. The bank regularly analyses its cash flows and strives to keep it on positive side.

# The Legislative and Regulatory Environment in which the Bank Operates

The characteristics and operations of the banking sector are governed by a comprehensive and sophisticated prudential regulatory and supervisory framework implemented by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This framework encompasses practices that promote and preserve financial sector stability, emphasize complete disclosure and transparency, encourages banks to function purely on market principles and forces them to operate in a fair and efficient manner guided by the high standards of corporate governance. To ensure effectiveness of this framework, the SBP has also put in place an elaborate structure of surveillance and supervision; which is being continuously updated to respond to the emerging developments in the sector and to conform to international standards.

## Chunk 178

# The Political Environment where the Bank Operates and other Countries that may affect the Ability of the Bank to Implement its Strategy

Throughout its history, Pakistan’s political and social landscapes have remained volatile and unstable; with these instabilities partially contributing to the stifled and irregular economic growth patterns witnessed in the country. Uncertainties associated with an unstable political environment impede long term visibility of monetary and fiscal authorities and hence, lead them to implement non-optimal macroeconomic policies that have a narrow horizon.

In the current socio-economic scenario, challenges facing the country have been further exacerbated by the ongoing political crisis; negatively impacting consumers, businesses, investor confidence and capital & financial market performances. The country’s banking system is inherently affected by the policymaking and political trends; affecting macro shifts to business models and revenue, with negative impacts on demand and unexpected market volatility.

Remaining cognizant, MCB continuously re-aligns its strategies to pave Bank’s future roadmap. However, the overall performance of the banking sector still remains heavily linked to the outcome of political will for implementing long neglected structural reforms that ensure sustainable macroeconomic stability and support an inclusive and sustainable national development agenda.

# Initiative towards Promoting and Enabling Innovation

MCB’s “Mission Statement” embraces and encapsulates its commitment for providing innovative and efficient financial solutions to create and nurture long term relationships with its wide range of customers.

# Human Resource Accounting Policy

At MCB Bank, Human Resource Accounting (HRA) encapsulates accounting of the Bank’s management and employees as ‘human assets’ or ‘capital’ that provides future benefits, rather than them being considered as an expense which is what comprises a typical approach under traditional human resource accounting.

The Bank has progressed forward to ensure that the people aspect of its business focuses on improving the standards and proficiency of employee skills and retaining talent for succession planning and expansion into new domains; thus generating greater contribution and improving returns through implementation of higher investment, efficiency and resource productivity initiatives. In fact, HRA has allowed the Bank to keep track of investments it is making in its human resources, and the specific returns it is generating from these investments, thus fostering a virtuous cycle of growth and returns.

The Bank leverages its HRA strategically to drive positive change in its human resources, which is the most vital asset of the bank. Over time, through insights from its HRA, the Bank has been able to strategically reposition its human resources to face rapid changes in the banking and financial services sector, especially now when digital banking is gaining fast credence. At the Bank, we have not only ensured that the skills and capabilities of our human resources are aligned to the times, but have also made sure that the Bank always remains in a position of deep strength through its people resources, notwithstanding the challenges prevalent in the external environment.

# Risk Management Framework

Risk is an inherent part of banking business activities. The risk management framework and governance structure at MCB helps to mitigate and counter any foreseeable risk in its various lines of business. Risk awareness forms an integral part of strategic and operational activities of risk management. Through its Global Risk Management Policy, Bank sets the best course of action under uncertainty by identifying, prioritizing, mitigating and monitoring risk issues, with the goal of enhancing shareholders’ value. Bank's risk management structure is based on the following five guiding principles:

- Optimizing risk/return in a controlled manner
- Establishing clear responsibility and accountability
- Establishing & maintaining independent and properly resourced risk management function.
- Promoting an open risk culture
- Adopting international best practices in risk management

The Bank executes its risk strategy and undertakes controlled risk-taking activities within its risk management framework. The Board of Directors (BOD) at MCB Bank Limited actively drive the risk management framework. Under the valuable guidance of BOD, the Bank has a proactive approach in dealing with factors that influence the financial standing of the Bank, to generate recurrent earnings and to maximize shareholder’s value by achieving an appropriate trade-off between risk and returns. An effective risk management framework along-with a robust risk governance structure, strong capital & liquidity coupled with a good quality of credit portfolio remains a cornerstone of the Bank’s risk management goals.

Empowerment and independence are the basic principles in risk management and it is implemented as a fundamental part of BOD’s vision. Independence of areas that are responsible for measuring, analyzing, controlling and monitoring risk from the frontline risk takers (i.e. business soliciting groups) is ensured within the Bank.

Risk takers and Risk controllers have independent reporting lines, yet work together to increase Bank’s value via efficient utilization of capital. Through a four eye principle for credit approval levels for corporate and retail banking, all exposure related requests are approved with the formal consent of at least two authorized individuals including one from the business side having credit approval authority and the other from risk management side having credit review authority.

The BOD and its Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) have ensured formulation and implementation of a comprehensive risk management framework. Under the BOD’s guidance, the Bank executed an effective risk strategy and continued to undertake controlled risk-taking activities within the risk management framework; combining core policies, procedures and process design with active portfolio management. The risk management framework requires strong integrated risk management practices in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and day-to-day business processes across the organization, with a goal to ensure that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner.

As a matter of principle, the Bank constantly endeavors to improve its risk management framework in light of the international best practices and regulatory guidelines. Accordingly, all policies and procedural documents that form part of the Bank’s risk management framework are regularly reviewed to keep them aligned with changing market dynamics, regulatory environment and international standards.

The RM&PRC guides the management on its risk-taking activities within the policy framework approved by the BOD. Regular meetings of RM&PRC are convened to oversee the risk exposures and their trends as a result of the various initiatives undertaken by the Bank. The committee reviews different aspects of the loan portfolio which, among others, includes asset growth, credit quality, credit concentration, lending business trend and cross sectional analysis. Review of various aspects of country risk, liquidity risk, market risk covering interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity price risk and technology risk along with the stress-testing is also a regular feature. Operational risk assessments, key risk indicators and major findings of Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) pertaining to processes, people, systems, technology and reputation are also regularly reviewed by the committee. The committee also reviews in detail the Bank’s capital levels under Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Capital Adequacy Ratio.

The Management Credit & Risk Committee is the management platform for discussion and deliberation on key risk issues in the portfolio. Regular meetings of the committee are convened to oversee the risk exposures in the portfolio of the Bank.

Credit risk review ensures to minimize credit risk associated at account and portfolio level. During the year 2022, the Bank continued with the policy to remain selective in disbursing its loan to low risk customers across all the industries.

# Capital Structure of the Bank

The Bank remained a well-capitalized institution with a capital base well above the regulatory limits and capital requirements under Basel frameworks. The Bank continues with a policy of sufficient profit retention to increase its risk absorption capacity. Bank’s total Capital Adequacy Ratio is 18.84% against the requirement of 11.50% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50%). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 16.32% against the requirement of 6%. The Bank maintained the leverage ratio of 6.12% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%.

& maintains a fairly diversified loan portfolio. Risk Review successfully managed to evaluate and approve increased number of loan requests, within required turnaround time, both for domestic and international operations. In line with SBP directives on implementation of IFRS-9, Bank's internal guidelines for management of 'Deteriorating Credits' have been revamped. An in-house request tracking & turnaround time monitoring software ensures tracking of proposals and monitoring of turnaround-time of credit proposals routed through the Risk Management Group. The Bank’s implemented Loan Origination System (LOS) for end to end automation of credit approval process, facilitates effective management of internal policies and controls as well as regulatory requirements while also contributing towards its transition to a paperless environment under the Green Banking initiative.

For risk categorized as sovereign/ government risk, the lending exposure is spread over multiple government owned or controlled organizations and departments which are engaged in a variety of tasks that range from different development related works to utility distribution and production. To manage adverse outcomes in terms of unfavorable scenarios, multiple control factors in the lending structure of the Bank provide additional comfort and support. Such controls range from quality of eligible collateral, pre-disbursement safety measures to post disbursement monitoring.

In order to further enhance the credit risk analysis, the bank has in place a probability of default based Internal Credit Risk Rating (ICRR) system which is based on statistical modeling and validation in line with Basel principles. The ICRR is currently focused on corporate-commercial customer category. Furthermore, scoring Models are also in place to calculate ICRR for Small Enterprise, Medium Enterprise, Agriculture Finance and Overseas exposures. An Internal Credit Risk Rating Model for facility risk rating has also been implemented which reflects expected loss rate of a credit facility.

In addition to the credit risk, like all financial institutions, MCB is also exposed to market risk through its trading and other investment activities. A comprehensive control structure is in place to ensure that the Bank does not exceed its qualitative and quantitative tolerance for market risk. A number of metrics like VaR methodologies complemented by sensitivity measures, notional limits, stop loss triggers at portfolio level/asset class and stress testing are used to capture and report the multi-dimensional aspects of market risk.

As an authorized derivatives dealer, the Bank is an active participant in the derivatives market. Overall limits in derivatives are approved by the BOD. Counter party limits structure for derivatives transactions is in place and exposures are monitored and reported on a continuous basis.

Operational Risk is being managed professionally in accordance with the Global Risk Management Policy, Policy on Internal Controls, Operational Risk Management Framework and various regulatory instructions. Operational Risk Inventory database covering losses, control breaches and near miss events is being maintained using professionally developed software. Operational risk events and Key Risk Indicators (KRI’s) are captured and management reports are generated. A process of Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) is in place to assess the operating effectiveness of controls and to implement remedial measures as needed. Updates on operational risk events are presented to the senior management and RM&PRC of the BOD on quarterly basis.

The Bank has developed Information Technology Risk Assessment Framework which enables better management of technology risk with respect to the security managed by IT Risk team. The IT Risk Assessment Framework helps the management to identify and manage key security risks and its associated threats for the critical infrastructure/IT assets of the Bank which includes systems, applications and network devices. The Bank has an internal operational security risk awareness program which is aimed at building capacity and inculcating risk aware culture in the staff through workshops and on-job awareness.

# Liquidity Management and Strategy to Overcome Liquidity Position

The Asset Liability Management Committee of the Bank has the responsibility for formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management (ALM) function. BOD has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of the Global Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences and evaluation of Banks’ liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. The underlying policies and procedures are reviewed and approved regularly at the senior management and BOD levels covering the Global Risk Management Policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment Policy and Liquidity Strategy including Contingency Funding Plan.

The Bank’s comprehensive liquidity management framework assists it to closely watch the liquidity position through monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing in order to ensure effective and timely decision making. The liquidity risk management approach at the Bank involves intra-day liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in the statement of financial position. A large and stable customer deposits base, along with a strong capital base provides strength and support for maintenance of a strong liquidity position. The Bank also has a substantial portfolio of marketable securities that can be realized in the event of liquidity stress.

Further, in line with SBP’s directives, the Bank has fully implemented BASEL III required liquidity standards and maintains liquidity ratios within prescribed limits. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 204.16% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 138.10% against requirement of 100%.

# Sensitivity Analysis due to Foreign Currency Fluctuation

The PKR depreciated by around 28.28% against the US Dollar in 2022. Foreign exchange risk exposes the bank to changes in the value of exposure denominated in foreign currencies due to the exchange rate fluctuation and volatility. The types of instruments exposed to this risk are mainly investments in foreign branches, advances and deposits denominated in foreign currency, cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions etc.

The core objective of the foreign exchange risk management is to ensure that the foreign exchange exposure of the Bank remains within defined risk appetite and insulates the Bank against undue losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

Limit structure to manage foreign exchange risk including gap limits in different tenors in major currencies are in place to control captioned risk. Bank's net open position and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits (FEEL) are monitored and reported on intra-day and day end basis. Foreign exchange risk parameters including VaR are generated and monitored on a daily basis. Stress testing of foreign exchange portfolio and its reporting to senior management and RM&PRC of the BOD is also a regular feature.

# Three lines of Defence model

The Bank has a well-structured Risk Management model based on three lines of defense which are independent of each other. Each line of defense is executed by different units. The first line of defense consists of business divisions and support units from whose activities the risks arise. RM&PRC being the second line of defense develops frameworks, policies, procedures and establishes risk appetite. Periodical stress testing and continuous monitoring are also an integral part of the second line of defense. The third is the audit and compliance functions which offer an independent oversight.

Metrics like VaR methodologies complemented by sensitivity measures, notional limits, loss triggers at a detailed portfolio level and stress testing are used to capture and report the multi-dimensional aspects of market risk. Monitoring: A comprehensive structure, ensuring the bank does not exceed its qualitative and quantitative tolerance for market risk, is in place. Management: The Bank has followed a conservative and balanced approach towards risk taking in the market risk area. The robust risk management architecture ensures that the exposures remain within the defined risk appetite. Furthermore, a comprehensive control structure is in place to ensure that the Bank does not exceed its qualitative and quantitative tolerance for market risk. A number of metrics like VaR methodologies complemented by sensitivity measures, notional limits, stop loss triggers at portfolio level/asset class, and stress testing are used to capture and report the multi-dimensional aspects of market risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Financial        |
| Capital Adequacy Risk | High               | Medium probability             | Measurement: The Bank is a well-capitalized institution with a capital base well above the regulatory limits and Basel-III requirements. Monitoring: The Bank regularly assesses the capital requirements and ensures that the minimum capital requirements specified by the State Bank are adhered to. Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment is a regular activity. Stress levels of major risks are assessed against the minimum capital requirement. Regular assessment of capital enables an evaluation of the amount, type and distribution of capital required to cover these risks. Management: The Bank remained a well-capitalized institution with a capital base well above the regulatory limits and capital requirements under BASEL frameworks. The Bank continues with a policy of sufficient profit retention to increase its risk absorption capacity. Bank’s total Capital Adequacy Ratio is 18.84% against the requirement of 11.50% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50%). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 16.32% against the requirement of 6%. The bank maintained a leverage ratio of 6.12% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. Going-concern capital requirements are assessed on a forward-looking basis – including as part of the annual budgeting process. These assessments consider the resilience of capital adequacy and leverage ratios under a range of hypothetical future states. The assessments incorporate assumptions regarding a range of regulatory and accounting aspects, such as IFRS 9, taking account of a number of factors including economic variables and impairments. The Bank will continue the policy of sufficient profit retention to increase its risk taking capacity and capitalize opportunities to protect the interests of stakeholders in the short, medium and long term. | Financial        |

| High               | Medium probability             | Measurement: Credit Risk Management function identifies, measures, manages, monitors and mitigates credit risk. Credit Risk is measured and estimated through detailed financial and non-financial analyses, internal and external credit risk ratings, environmental risk rating and customers’ behavior analysis. Stress testing of top customers in credit portfolio is also carried out regularly. Monitoring: Credit Risk Management organizational structure ensures pre and post-facto management of credit risk. Credit Review function carries out pre-fact evaluation of counterparties & the credit structures and hindsight reviews, the Credit Risk Control (CRC) function performs post-fact monitoring including security documentation and limits monitoring. Business side continuously keeps in touch with customers to have updated information about the clients. Management: Bank has been selective in taking exposure on good quality borrowers across all industry segments. Multiple factors in bank’s lending structure provide additional comfort and support in mitigating credit risk. These include quality of eligible collateral, pre-disbursement safety measures, post disbursement monitoring, etc. Bank has a fairly diversified loan portfolio. Credit Risk Review ensures to minimize credit risk associated at account and portfolio level. During the year, the Bank continued with the policy to remain selective in disbursing its loan to low risk customers across all the industries & maintains a fairly diversified loan portfolio. Risk Review successfully managed to evaluate and approve increased number of loan requests, within required turnaround time, both for domestic and international operations. Bank’s implemented Loan Origination System (LOS) for end to end automation of credit approval process facilitates effective management of Bank’s internal policies & controls as well as regulatory requirements. LOS has also contributed towards Bank’s transition to paperless environment under the Green Banking initiative. For risk categorized as sovereign/ government risk, the lending exposure is spread over multiple government owned or controlled organizations and departments which are engaged in a variety of tasks that range from different development related works to utility distribution and production. To manage adverse outcomes in terms of unfavorable scenarios, multiple control factors in the lending structure of the Bank provide additional comfort and support. Such controls range from quality of eligible collateral, pre-disbursement safety measures to post disbursement monitoring. Through a four eye principle for credit approval levels for corporate and retail banking, all such exposure related requests are approved with the formal consent of at least two authorized individuals including one from business side having credit approval authority and other from risk management side having credit review authority. The MC\&RC is the management platform for discussion and deliberation on key risk issues in the portfolio. Regular meetings of the committee are convened to oversee the risk exposures in the portfolio of the Bank. | Financial        |

| Credit Risk    | High               | Medium probability             | In order to further enhance the credit risk analysis, the bank has in place a probability of default based Internal Credit Risk Rating (ICRR) system which is based on statistical modeling and validation in line with Basel principles. The ICRR is currently focused on corporate-commercial customer category. Furthermore; Scoring Models are also in place to calculate ICRR for Small Enterprise, Medium Enterprise, Agriculture Finance and Overseas exposure. An Internal Credit Risk Rating Model for facility risk rating has also been implemented which reflects expected loss rate of a credit facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Financial                                      |
| Liquidity Risk | High               | Medium to Low probability      | Measurement: MCB regularly performs Liquidity Risk Analysis and liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity risk assessments and stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Bank under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. Monitoring: Liquidity positions are regularly monitored through established early warning Indicators and liquidity risk analysis. Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratios are monitored regularly. Management: MCB’s Liquidity Risk Management approach involves intraday liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in balance sheet structure. The Bank’s large and stable base of customer deposits, along with Bank’s strong capital base, indicates strong liquidity position. Bank also has a substantial portfolio of marketable securities that can be realized in the event of liquidity stress. The Asset Liability Management Committee of the bank has the responsibility for the formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management (ALM) function. BOD has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of Global Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of Banks’ liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. Underlying policies and procedures are reviewed and approved regularly at the senior management and BOD Levels including Global Risk Management Policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment Policy and Liquidity Strategy. Further, in line with SBP’s directives, Bank has fully implemented BASEL III required liquidity standards and maintains liquidity ratios including LCR and NSFR with a considerable cushion over and above the regulatory requirement to mitigate any liquidity risk. | Financial, Intellectual, Social & Relationship |

# Impact of Government Policies on the Bank Performance

Amidst the manifold challenges faced by the Bank, encompassing a tough operating environment, lower economic activity and rising cost of doing business, MCB stayed steadfast in supporting government's economic policies aimed at fostering economic development and better utilization of resources.

Key measures taken to implement government’s overall sustainable and inclusive growth objectives stemming from the national agenda of financial inclusion, digitization of payments landscape, documentation of financial transactions and integration of overseas Pakistanis with the country’s banking system included:

- Sustained focus on serving economically significant and priority sectors, including agriculture and SME sectors through product diversification, customer acquisition and facilitation approaches. During the year in review, the Bank achieved its regulatory target for agriculture credit disbursements and successfully rolled out ‘Electronic Warehouse Receipt Financing’ (EWRF) facility with the purpose of increasing quality of agriculture based lending portfolio. Furthermore, the Bank’s total SME book size increased to Rs. 14,734 million as at December 31, 2022.
- Facilitation of overseas Pakistanis under the RDA initiative, MPMG, Kamyab Jawan and other national financial inclusion/support initiatives have remained a key focus area for the Bank. The total inflows at MCB, for the year 2022, under RDA initiative summed up to USD 203.17 million while the total home remittance inflows stood at USD 3,434 million, improving the market share to 11.6% and further consolidated Bank’s position as an active participant in SBP’s cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.
- From subsidized financing / re-finance perspective, the Bank successfully executed SBP’s product initiative of Rupee-based discounting. Hence, ensuring provision of an adequate supply of financing to the value-added industries at competitive rates and also incentivizing exporters to bring in their proceeds on time to improve foreign exchange inflows in the interbank market. The Bank has also disbursed loans under the ‘Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs’ program in line with SBP’s agenda to reduce gender gap in financial inclusion.
- The digital transformation drive of the country registered some major accomplishments during the year. SBP’s “Customers’ Digital Onboarding Framework” introduced a comprehensive framework that inter alia elaborates the basic parameters for opening of bank accounts for Resident Pakistanis through digital channels. The digitization of payment landscape was further augmented through launch of second phase of SBP’s flagship payment system ‘RAAST’; enabling free instant ‘Person to Person’ (P2P) payments for retail transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank has achieved an aggregate of 37,060 RAAST ID registrations whereas the total value generated through these transactions exceeded Rs. 61 billion.



Economy Review

## Chunk 205

# Global Economy

The global outlook deteriorated markedly throughout the year 2022. Synchronized monetary policy tightening to contain the rapid pace of inflation, less favorable financial conditions, and disruptions from the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine all contributed to a sharp deceleration in economic activity.

The slowdown in global economic activity has been broad-based and sharper-than-expected. Major economies are undergoing a period of pronounced weakness amidst persistent inflation and elevated financial and geopolitical uncertainties. The resulting spillover, from this downturn, is further exacerbating headwinds posed to emerging market and developing economies due to increasing fiscal consolidation pressures and risks of sovereign defaults amidst rising borrowing costs and diminishing policy support.

The economic outlook has several downside risks and the ultimate outcome still remains uncertain and largely dependent on the successful calibration of monetary and fiscal policies, the course of the war in Ukraine, growth prospects in China and the materialization of multilateral cooperation to prevent further geopolitical fragmentation.

---

## Chunk 206

# Domestic Economy

Pakistan witnessed significant economic and political headwinds in 2022. Rising inflation, depleting foreign exchange reserves, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit compounded the issues requiring immediate attention. In this backdrop, Fitch & Moody’s and S&P Global lowered country’s sovereign credit rating.

In June 2022, Pakistan witnessed one of its worst floods. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained elevated through the year, most notably due to the war in Ukraine. For these reasons, the headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of 27.32% in August.

During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625bps to 16%. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation.

On the external side, current account deficit (CAD) started to decline in the second half of the calendar year and reached a low of USD 0.276 billion in November 22. This was achieved through contraction in Imports while the exports dampened due to slowdown in the global economy. The FX reserves of the country depleted significantly owing to external debt payments. On the fiscal side, the government aims to collect PKR 7.47 trillion in taxes and intends to achieve a fiscal deficit of 4.9% of the GDP. During July to Dec 2022, FBR collected PKR 3,428 billion depicting an increase of 17% from the last year.

During the year 2022, PKR depreciated by 28.3% against USD closing at 226.43. This marked the highest devaluation in the last 5 years. The weak balance of payment situation of the country remained the primary reason behind this depreciation. At the year end, SBP reserves stood at USD 5.585 billion and total liquid reserves at USD 10.8 billion, lowest since 2014.

IMF completed its 6th, 7th & 8th reviews of Pakistan Extended Fund Facility (EFF) during the year 2022. The 9th review, originally due in the last week of October 2022 has still not been completed as Pakistan strives to fulfill the essential performance criteria for this review.

## Chunk 207

# Future Outlook of the Economy

The revival of the stalled IMF program and external inflows from friendly countries remain vital for Pakistan’s economy. However, the country will have to undergo strong fiscal and monetary adjustments to start the stalled program with IMF. These adjustments include reduction in gas and power circular debts, flexible exchange rate and enhanced tax revenue collection amongst others. These adjustments will put further inflationary pressures and significantly reduce aggregate demand.

The year 2022 was a forgettable year for capital markets with myriad challenges on the economic, political and geo-political fronts.

# Staff Compensation/Remuneration Policy

The Remuneration Policy of the Bank is designed to promote a culture of sound compensation aligned with risk and responsibilities in a transparent manner for acquisition of talent, retention of employees and achievement of stakeholder expectations. MCB's remuneration policy applies to all staff. The policy covers identification of Material Risk Taker (MRT) and Material Risk Controllers (MRC), performance assessment through balanced scorecards, compensation structure and deferral mechanism.

The responsibility for approving the remuneration policy rests with the Board of Directors. The Board has constituted Human Resource & Remuneration Committee (HR&RC) for recommending to the Board, the structure of the remuneration policy; including the remuneration setting mechanisms, composition of remuneration, and other related matters. HR&RC may take the support of Bank's functions (e.g. Finance, Risk, Audit, Compliance, and HR). At management level, HRMG leads the overall remuneration policy of MCB.

All compensation provided to MCB staff can be divided into fixed remuneration or variable remuneration. Fixed remuneration is that part of the compensation which remains unaffected by the performance of the Bank or the individual employee. Fixed component of remuneration consists of basic salary and allowances that are part of the total compensation package of the employee. Variable remuneration is that part of the total compensation package of an employee which is linked with some predetermined measures of performance. Variable compensation is linked with the individual's performance and comprises of performance bonus, commissions, incentives and allowances.

The Bank has identified functions and designations as MRTs/MRCs. These include, but not limited to, the President/CEO, direct reportees to the President/CEO (members of management committee), Country heads of overseas branches, direct reportees to the members of senior management managing critical functions as determined by HR&RC and all other material Business units.

Balanced scorecards are defined for all MRTs & MRCs for carrying out an objective and transparent performance assessment. The variable compensation for the MRTs and MRCs is linked to the performance result derived from the scorecard. The performance assessment for MRTs and MRCs is performed via the structured balanced scorecard mechanism that is in place to ensure that objective risk and return measures are duly taken into account for determining the bonuses and awards for MRTs and MRCs. The bonuses and awards for MRTs are determined based on the performance of the individual, their respective department and the overall Bank. MRCs in the Bank have suitable autonomy and authority to perform their tasks independently, without influence from the functions they are assigned to oversee and review. KPIs in the scorecards of MRCs are independent of the KPIs of the business functions that they oversee. This ensures that achievement of financial targets of the business functions are not considered for the performance assessment of the MRCs.

For MCB employees classified as MRTs and MRCs, at least 25% of their variable remuneration shall be deferred. Minimum deferral period is three years with no vesting prior to year 1.

None of the deficiencies identified had a material impact on Financial Reporting.

Based upon the results derived through ongoing testing of financial reporting controls and internal audits carried out during the year, the management considers that the Bank’s existing internal control system is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored. The management will continue enhancing its coverage and compliance with the SBP Guidelines on Internal Controls.

Concerted efforts are made by every Group to improve the control environment at grass root level by regularly reviewing and streamlining procedures to prevent and rectify control lapses as well as imparting training for improvement at various levels.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022.

# Green Banking

During the past few decades, rapidly changing climate conditions have motivated all sectors of society including the financial industry to play their role in achieving the goal of environmental conservation. As a result, the concept of Green Banking has gained importance among financial institutions as they play their role in de-carbonization of the global economy.

In the financial industry, Green Banking is an emerging concept which aims to integrate sustainability into banking operations/businesses to combat against climate change. It intends to make financial institutions resilient against environmental vulnerabilities through adoption of sustainable banking practices and mitigation of environmental risk emanating from the operations.

MCB Bank is intensifying its efforts to conserve the environment by contributing towards the climate change mitigation measures. The Bank is fully aligned with SBP's aim to transform the country's economy into a low carbon and climate resilient economy through implementation of Green Banking Guidelines (GBG).

Since the establishment of the MCB Green Banking Office (GBO), Green Banking Culture has gained traction within the Bank. MCB undertakes its responsibility to minimize its direct and indirect carbon footprints on the environment by making the Bank's processes, the use of Information Technology and physical infrastructure more sustainable and efficient to have minimal impact on the environment amongst its stakeholders such that operational processes are transformed to safeguard the Bank against the threat of environmental vulnerabilities.

# Dry Waste Office Certification

MCB Bank has personally maintained its industry-wide prestigious certification. Among many other initiatives, MCB Bank has also partnered with WWF to achieve Green Office Certification for the second time. This certification is for the organization in providing services pertaining to dry waste recycling through its green partner network. The dry waste certification surveillance audit is conducted by WWF to ensure compliance with recycling services currently being rendered at our iconic building, MCEC Center Lahore. Every year, the dry waste that weighs around 11 tons is segregated and recycled in an environmentally friendly manner, which reduces the burden on landfill sites, making it better for the environment.

This accreditation has positioned MCB Bank as one of the few leading banks that have successfully met the requirements of such a significant Green Office certification program.

# Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

MCB Bank is committed to playing its role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by implementing the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The plan aims to cut down the consumption of energy, electricity, fuel, paper, and waste, creating a more sustainable environment. The transportation of waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.

# Tree Plantation Drive

The need for afforestation has increased due to the adverse environmental impact of pollution. Previously, MCB Bank undertook the Tree Plantation Drive as an environment-based CSR initiative in collaboration with Civil Society Organization 21 Cavalry Ground, Petka Lahore. These plants were procured using the Green Points that were earned by the Bank through the recycling of dry waste. The plants were properly maintained by the relevant authorities, and as a result, now they have grown into proper trees and are contributing to pollution reduction.

# Ground Banking

MCB Bank has initiated its own impact reduction initiative in compliance with SBF's Green Banking guidelines. The electricity reduction targets for branches are minimal across Pakistan.

We aggregate our material stakeholders in terms of their level of influence on us and our impact on them. Based on this broad-based assessment, we prioritize these relationships and while we engage with all our stakeholders, we have identified our key stakeholders as those with whom we need to collaborate with, consult and involve and as such have developed goals for each.

# Stakeholder Engagement

The development of sustained stakeholder relationships is paramount to the performance of any institution. From short term assessments to long-term strategic relationship building, ‘Stakeholders’ Engagement’ lies at the core of our business practices to promote improved risk management, compliance with regulatory and lender requirements in addition to overall growth of the Bank. In achieving and entrenching its integrated approach to sustainability, MCB Bank takes a highly collaborative approach towards ensuring maximum interaction with, and input by all its stakeholders.

At MCB, stakeholder engagement involves far more than merely communicating with its various stakeholder groups. The Bank regards its stakeholders as partners and makes every effort to use all possible mediums to ensure that they are abreast with disclosures, aware of forums to provide valuable input and feedback that can help the Bank to grow, strengthen relations and meet expectations to serve better.

Face to face discussions have also been arranged with foreign analysts as and when required. The briefing further envisages our transparent and continuously evolving stakeholders’ engagement approach.

# Issues Raised in the Last Annual General Meeting (AGM)

The proceedings of the 74ᵗʰ Annual General Meeting of the shareholders of MCB Bank Limited was held on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 at 11:00 am, Nishat Hotel, Emporium Mall, Lahore. Mian Mohammad Mansha, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, presided over the meeting. The meeting was attended by Board members of the Bank including the Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary.

The company secretary invited the CFO to present key highlights of the audited financial statements for the year 2021 and elucidate on the salient features of the Banks’ performance. There were no significant issues raised in the last AGM that are pending implementation, however, the shareholders while appreciating the overall growth in Bank’s financial performance sought some general clarifications and comments on the progress of the Bank.

Citing prevailing uncertainty about the future path of global energy and food prices amidst the geopolitical tensions and its repercussion for the domestic inflationary indicators, one of the shareholders enquired about the prospect of further monetary policy tightening in 2022 and the corresponding interest rate trajectory. Responding to the query, the CFO stated that while the country was confronted with a surge in inflationary pressures, the challenges on the political and fiscal side combined with external account imbalances had further exacerbated the downside side risks. Hence, the management of the Bank expects further tightening in SBP’s monetary policy stance in order to anchor country’s inflationary outlook and keep real interest rates at a level that supports sustainable economic growth. He further added that the Bank’s management was proactively monitoring the evolving scenario and remains committed to delivering optimum return for the shareholders.

The CEO informed the shareholders that the Bank remains a well-capitalized institution with a capital base well above the regulatory limits and Basel capital requirements. He also mentioned that the Bank had the highest cash dividend per share in the industry and remained one of the prime stocks traded in the Pakistan equity market, which is appropriately reflected in its market capitalization; one of the highest in the financial institution category as at December 31, 2021.

The shareholders appreciated the services of the Board of Directors for its visionary approach and collective wisdom reflected in the sound financial performance of the Bank.

# Following businesses were also discussed during the AGM:

- Consideration and approval of Annual Accounts of 2021
- Approval of Final Cash dividend for the year 2021
- Appointment of External Auditors

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Chunk 441

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

---

## Chunk 442

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Annual Report 2022
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:
1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated profit and loss account, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.
2. We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total loans and advances of the Bank.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular No 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2021. SBP via same circular has finalized the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

During 2022, the management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 taking into account the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. In addition, the Bank will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

An overview of the IFRS 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP:

---

## Chunk 455

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will base on the business model within which

## Chunk 456

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealised gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognised.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realised gains or losses are recognised in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognised in the income statement.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The Bank has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

---

## Chunk 457

# Equity Securities

The Bank expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. For equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. Expected credit losses are not recognised for equity instruments designated at FVOCI.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation to the banks till one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

---

## Chunk 458

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those passing the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those passing the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

---

## Chunk 459

# Impairment of financial assets not held at FVTPL

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for Expected Credit Losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).

## Chunk 460

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

is recognised are categorized in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a SICR are categorized in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are categorized in ‘stage 3’.

Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SICR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default. These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For calculating ECL, the Bank shall classify its financial assets under three following categories:

1. Stage 1: Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has not been a SICR since initial recognition, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
2. Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but they are not credit impaired, the Bank shall recognize an allowance for the lifetime ECL for all exposures categorized in this stage based on the actual maturity profile.
3. Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: Financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. The Bank shall recognize ECL on these financial assets using the higher off approach, which means that lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 is compared with regulatory provision required as per Prudential regulations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

---

## Chunk 461

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Bank shall calculate 12 month ECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., stage 1 or a lifetime expected loss for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., stage 2.

Annual Report 2022

---

## Chunk 462

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

At every reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset. If there is a SICR, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (stage 2 or 3).

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL framework and stage 3 provision would be higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

---

## Chunk 463

# Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Bank’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan is yet to issue a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from January 01, 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures of adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 464

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by IFRS-9, the Bank will not be restating comparatives on initial application. The cumulative impact of initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the accounting period.

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

---

## Chunk 465

# Impact on Equity of the Bank

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at January 01, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 3,050.368 million, representing corresponding impact of:

- An increase of approximately Rs. 3,422.521 million (net of tax) related to impairment requirements;
- Adjustment of approximately Rs. 372.153 million related to classification and measurement requirements, other than impairment.

The Bank continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption.

---

## Chunk 466

# Impact on regulatory capital

The Banks are allowed to include provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the Banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, Banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

267

Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

## Chunk 467

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The estimated impact of initial adoption of IFRS 9 on the Bank’s capital ratios, without accounting for the allowed transitional arrangement, is as follows:

|                                                                          | As per adopted IFRS 9 | As per current ARS |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio                              | 16.53%                | 16.32%             |
| Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio                                            | 16.53%                | 16.32%             |
| Total Capital Adequacy Ratio                                             | 19.06%                | 18.84%             |
| CET1 available to meet buffers (as a percentage of risk weighted assets) | 9.03%                 | 8.82%              |

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime to the extent of the Bank's domestic operations, whereas the requirements of this standard are incorporated for overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

Including the above, there are other new and amended standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 but are considered not to be relevant or do not to have any significant impact on the Bank's unconsolidated financial statements and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 468

# 3.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

---

## Chunk 469

# a) Classification of investments

In classifying investments, the Bank follows the guidance provided in SBP circulars:

- Investments classified as 'held for trading', are securities which are acquired with an intention to trade by taking advantage of short term market / interest rate movements and are to be sold within 90 days of acquisition.
- Investments classified as 'held to maturity' are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investment to maturity.
- The investments other than those in subsidiaries and associates which are not classified as 'held for trading' or 'held to maturity' are classified as 'available for sale'.

---

## Chunk 470

# b) Provision against advances

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess the amount of non-performing advances and provision required there against on regular basis. While assessing this requirement, various factors including the delinquency in the account, financial position of the borrowers and the requirements of the Prudential Regulations are considered.

The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the relevant regulations and management's judgment as explained in note 11.4.4.

---

## Chunk 471

# c) Impairment of 'available for sale' equity investments

The Bank determines that 'available for sale' equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. The determination of what is significant or prolonged is based on various factors.



Annual Report 2022

---

## Chunk 472

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, the impairment may be appropriate when there is an evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee and sector performance, changes in technology and operational/financial cash flows.

# d) Taxation

In making the estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Bank, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

---

## Chunk 473

# e) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.

---

## Chunk 474

# f) Depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation of operating fixed assets

The management reviews the useful lives and residual values of assets annually by considering expected pattern of economic benefit that the management expects to drive from the item and the maximum period up to which such benefits are expected to be available. Any change in estimates in future years might affect the carrying amounts of the respective items of assets with a corresponding effect on the depreciation charge and impairment. Such change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors". Further, the Bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

---

## Chunk 475

# g) Staff retirement benefits

Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 38 of these unconsolidated financial statements for the actuarial valuation of staff retirement benefit plans. Actuarial assumptions are entity's best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post employment benefits. Changes in these assumptions in future years may affect the liability / asset under these plans in those years.

---

## Chunk 476

# h) Lease term for lease liability and right-of-use asset

The Bank applies judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 477

# i) Provision and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Contingent assets are not recognized and are also not disclosed until an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

---

## Chunk 478

# 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts and certain investments and derivative financial instruments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value. In addition, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right of use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liability and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

These risk management policies continue to remain robust and the Bank is reviewing its portfolio regularly and conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks. Detailed disclosure on financial risk management has been reported in note 45 to the unconsolidated financial statements.

# 6. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year:

---

## Chunk 480

# 6.1 IFRS 16 - Lease Liability & Right-of-Use Assets

The Bank enters into leasing arrangements of buildings for its branches and offices. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options. At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Banks’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation/accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognized upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognized in the profit and loss account.

The Bank has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the profit or loss account on a straight-line basis.

When there is a change in scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease is accounted for as a lease modification. The lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease if modification increases the scope of lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the particular contracts, if any. When the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding adjustment is made to right-of-use asset.

---

## Chunk 481

# 6.2 Investments

The Bank classifies its investments as follows:

Held for trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for generating profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices, interest rate movements, dealers margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists.



Annual Report 2022

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# Held to maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity in respect of which the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.

# Available for sale

These are investments, other than those in subsidiaries and associates, that do not fall under the 'held for trading' or 'held to maturity' categories.

---

## Chunk 482

# Initial measurement

Investments are initially recognized at cost which in case of investments other than 'held for trading' include transaction costs associated with the investment. Transaction costs on investments held for trading are expensed in the profit and loss account.

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognized at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investment.

---

## Chunk 483

# Subsequent measurement

In accordance with the requirements of the SBP, quoted securities, other than those classified as 'held to maturity', investments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are subsequently re-measured to market value. Surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as 'available for sale', is taken to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through statement of comprehensive income in equity till disposal at which time it is recorded in profit and loss account.

Surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as 'held for trading', is taken to the profit and loss account, currently.

Unquoted equity securities (excluding investments in subsidiaries and associates) are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. Break-up value of equity securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available financial statements. Investments classified as 'held to maturity' are carried at amortized cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

---

## Chunk 484

# Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Bank has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

---

## Chunk 485

# Impairment

Provision for impairment in the values of securities (except debentures, participation term certificates and term finance certificates) is made currently. Impairment of 'available for sale' equity investments is discussed in 3.4(c). Provisions for impairment in value of debentures, participation term certificates and term finance certificates are made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

Impairment against investment in subsidiaries and associates is assessed as per the requirements of IAS 36.

---

## Chunk 486

# Sale and repurchase agreements

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in these unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings. Securities purchased under an agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognized in these unconsolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lending's to financial institutions. The difference between the purchase / sale and re-sale / re-purchase price is recognized as mark-up income / expense on a time proportion basis, as the case may be.

## Chunk 487

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# 6.4 Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Specific provision is determined on the basis of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP and charged to the profit and loss account. Provisions are held against identified as well as unidentified losses. Provisions against unidentified losses include general provision in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Prudential Regulations for Consumer Financing and Prudential Regulations for Small and Medium Enterprise Financing issued by the SBP and provision based on historical loss experience on advances. General provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Leases where the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. Finance lease receivables are included in advances to the customers.

---

## Chunk 488

# 6.5 Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any. Cost of property and equipment of foreign operations includes exchange differences arising on currency translation at year-end rates.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

Depreciation on all fixed assets (excluding land) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these unconsolidated financial statements and after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use while no depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. A decrease arising on revaluation of fixed assets is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset. A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Gains / losses on sale of property and equipment are credited / charged to the profit and loss account currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account.

# 6.5.1 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

---

## Chunk 490

# 6.6 Impairment

The carrying amount of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amounts. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of that asset.

## Chunk 491

# 6.7 Staff retirement benefits

The Bank operates the following staff retirement benefits for its employees:

- a) For clerical / non-clerical staff who did not opt for the new scheme, the Bank operates the following:
- – an approved contributory provident fund;
- – an approved gratuity scheme; and
- – a contributory benevolent scheme
- b) For clerical / non-clerical staff who joined the Bank after the introduction of the new scheme and for others who opted for the new scheme introduced in 1975, the Bank operates the following:
- – an approved non-contributory provident fund introduced in lieu of the contributory provident fund;

## Chunk 568

# 22.1

Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions / deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

# 22.2

Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# Tax Disputes

For assessment year 1988-89 through tax year 2021, the tax department disputed Bank's treatment on certain issues, where the Bank's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 844 million (2021: Rs. 1,497 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance / deducted at source. The Bank has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Bank are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in the financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Bank's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# 38.15

The defined benefit plans may expose the bank to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

- Investment risk: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.
- Longevity risk: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.
- Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.
- Withdrawal rate risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'held to maturity'. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements. Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy as stated in note 6.4 to these unconsolidated financial statements. The maturity and repricing profile and effective rates are stated in note 45. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities other than those carried at fair value and disclosed in note 41.1 are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid up capital (net of losses) for all locally incorporated banks of Rs. 10 billion. The paid up capital of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022 stood at Rs. 11.851 billion (2021: Rs. 11.851 billion) and is in compliance with the SBP requirements. Further, under Basel III instructions, banks are required to maintain minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50% as at reporting dates (including a capital conservation buffer of 1.5% which has been revised downwards from 2.5% as per BPRD Circular No. 12 dated March 26, 2020), Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio of 6.0% and Tier 1 ratio of 7.50% as at reporting dates. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios. Under the current capital adequacy regulations, credit risk and market risk exposures are measured using the Standardized Approach and operational risk is measured using the Basic Indicator Approach. Credit risk mitigants are also applied against the Bank’s exposures based on eligible collateral under simple approach.

# Stress Testing

Credit Risk stress testing is a regular exercise. Bank’s credit exposures including funded and non-funded facilities are subjected to stress tests. This exercise is conducted on a quarterly basis through assigning shocks to all assets of the Bank and assessing its resulting affect on capital adequacy inline with SBP requirements.

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global lowered the country’s sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained elevated through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of 27.32% in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to 16%. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

The Bank is regularly conducting assessments of the credit portfolio, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Bank is confident that it has more than sufficient risk bearing capacity to withstand these difficult times.

# 45.2 Market Risk

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and / or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. The Bank is exposed to market risk primarily through its trading activities, which are centered in the Treasury and Foreign Exchange Group and the Capital Market Division. Market risk also arises from market-making, facilitation of client business and proprietary positions in equities, fixed income and interest rate products and foreign exchange, which exposes bank to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk.

The Bank’s Market Risk Management structure consists of Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) of the Board, Management Credit and Risk Committee, ALCO and independent Market Risk Management Division reporting directly to Group Head Risk Management. Market Risk function works in close partnership with the business segments to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Bank and to define market risk policies and procedures. Market Risk seeks to facilitate efficient risk / return management decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Bank’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market risk authority, including both approval of market risk limits and approval of market risks is vested in the ALCO.

In line with regulatory requirements, the Bank has clearly defined, in its Global Risk Management policy, the positions which shall be subject to market risk. The definition covers the accounting classifications as well as positions booked by different business groups under “Available for Sale” category. The assets subject to trading book treatment are frequently, mostly on daily basis, valued.

and actively managed. The positions which does not fulfill the criteria of Trading book falls under the Banking Book and are treated as per SBP requirements. The Bank measures and manages Market Risk by using different risk parameters with combinations of various limits. Board approved Global Risk Management Policy provides guidelines for assuming controlled market risk, its monitoring and management. The approved limits are compared with the numbers generated by the market risk management systems based on the trading activity and the outstanding positions.

Besides conventional methods, the Bank also uses VaR (Value at Risk) technique for market risk assessment of positions assumed by its treasury and capital market groups. In-house based solutions are used for calculating mark to market value of positions and generating VaR (value at risk) and sensitivity numbers. Thresholds for different positions are established to compare the expected losses at a given confidence level and over a specified time horizon.

A framework of stress testing, scenario analysis and reverse stress tests covering both banking and trading books as per SBP guidelines is also in place. The results of the stress tests are reviewed by senior management and also reported to the SBP.

The Bank is also exposed to interest rate risk both in trading and banking books. Risk parameters along with the marked to market values of government securities held by the Bank’s treasury are generated on daily basis. The risk parameters include duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP), and VaR on individual security basis as well as on portfolio basis. These reports are presented to the senior management for review on a daily basis.

# 45.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk exposes the bank to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than home currency due to the exchange rate fluctuation and volatility. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign branches, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated deposits, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, etc.

The core objective of foreign exchange risk management is to ensure the foreign exchange exposure of the Bank remain within defined risk appetite and insulate bank against undue losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

Limit structure to manage Foreign exchange risk including gap limits on different tenors in major currencies are in place to control risk. Bank’s net open position and Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL) is monitored and reported on intra-day and day end basis. Foreign exchange risk parameters including VaR is generated and monitored on daily basis. Stress testing of foreign exchange portfolio and its reporting to senior management and RM&PRC of the Board is a regular feature.

The interest rate sensitivity profile is prepared on a quarterly basis based on the re-pricing or contractual maturities of assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by performing periodic gap analysis, sensitivity analysis and stress testing and taking appropriate actions where required.

# Liquidity Management

The Asset Liability Committee of the Bank has the responsibility for formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management function. Board has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of Banks’ liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. A framework to assess the maturity profile of non-contractual assets and liabilities is in place to supplement the liquidity management. Bank’s comprehensive liquidity management framework assists it to closely watch the liquidity position through monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, to ensure effective and timely decision making.

The Bank’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to identify measure and manage in a timely manner the liquidity risk position of the Bank. The underlying policies and procedures include: Global Risk Management policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment policy, Contingency Funding Plan, Liquidity Strategy and Limit Structure which are reviewed and approved regularly by the senior management / Board members. Moreover; the Bank also prepares a ‘Contingency Funding Plan’ (CFP) to address liquidity issues in time of stress / crises situation containing early warning indicators to preempt unforeseen liquidity crises. The Bank conducts Liquidity Risk Analysis on regular basis as well as Maturity of gaps are also reviewed in order to ensure diversification in terms of tenors. MCB liquidity risk framework envisages to project the Bank’s funding position during temporary and long-term liquidity changes, including those caused by liability erosion and explicitly identifying quantifying and ranking all sources of funding preferences, such as reducing assets, modifying or increasing liability structure; and using other alternatives for controlling statement of financial position changes. The Bank performs regular liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Bank under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. The Bank’s liquidity risk management approach involves intraday liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in balance sheet structure.

In view of the relaxation granted by SBP for deferral of principal and markup and for rescheduling / restructuring of loans there will be an impact on the maturity profile of the Bank. The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Bank is monitoring the liquidity position and the Bank is confident that the liquidity buffer currently maintained is sufficient to cater to any adverse movement in the cash flow maturity profile.

# Intraday Liquidity Management

Intraday liquidity management is about managing the daily payments and cash flows. Bank has policies to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained during the day to make payments through local payment system. The policy of the Bank is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in all geographical locations and for all currencies and hence to be in a position, in the normal course of business, to meet obligations, repay depositors and fulfill commitments.

## Chunk 656

# Managing Funding Sources

Managing funding sources, as per policy the Bank maintain a portfolio of marketable securities that can either be sold outright or sold through a repurchase agreement to generate cash flows for meeting unexpected liquidity requirement. As a part of liquidity management the Bank maintains borrowing relationships to ensure the continued access to diverse market of funding sources. The Bank’s sound credit rating together with excellent market reputation has enabled the Bank to secure ample call lines with local and foreign banks. The level of liquidity reserves as per regulatory requirements also mitigates risks. The Bank’s investment in marketable securities is much higher than the Statutory Liquidity Requirements.

## Chunk 661

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# 45.5 Derivative Risk

Most business clients have either interest rate exposures arising from debt financing or currency exposures arising out of commercial transactions from import and export of goods. Businesses face the risk of sudden movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates that may adversely affect their profitability. The Bank provides solutions to this problem through its derivatives desk in major types of derivative instruments i.e.; forwards, futures, swaps and options. As an Authorized Derivative Dealer (ADD), the Bank is an active participant in Derivative market and has flexibility in providing a broad range of derivatives products covering both hedging and market making to satisfy customers’ needs. As an ADD, the Bank offers derivative products which are permitted under the Financial Derivative Business Regulations (FDBR) or as permitted by the State Bank of Pakistan. Before executing Derivative transactions, the Bank ensures that the clients understand the risk and reward associated with the derivative being offered. Derivative transactions are executed with appropriate clients only.

Risk management activities take place at the following different levels.

In line with SBP’s regulatory guidelines, Bank hedges back-to-back all option transactions with other financial institutions. Bank minimizes the exchange rate risk on its Cross Currency Swap Portfolio by hedging the exposure in interbank market. Bank also manages interest rate risk on its Interest Rate Derivatives and Cross Currency Swaps through various sensitivity limits approved by ALCO. Marked to market positions and sensitivity of the derivatives transactions are monitored on regular basis. All individual deals are approved at the appropriate level of authority after analyzing the risk and benefits associated with the deals.

## Chunk 664

# Credit Risk

# Notes To The Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The Bank uses a third party’s Super Derivative System which provides front end sales and structuring capabilities, end to end valuation solutions, risk management systems, back end processing and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures and carry out sensitivity analysis. The goal of asset/liability management (ALM) is to properly manage the risk related to changes in interest rates, the mix of balance sheet assets and liabilities, the holding of foreign currencies, and the use of derivatives. Due to thin liquidity in the derivative market, interest rate derivatives are not actively used to manage/alter the interest rate risk profile of the Bank.

| The Group makes provision against advances extended in Pakistan on a time-based criteria that involves ensuring that all non-performing advances are classified in accordance with the ageing criteria specified in the Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). |                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                    |
| In addition to the above time-based criteria, the PRs require a subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of borrowers to determine the classification of advances.                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                    |
| The PRs also require the creation of general provision for certain categories of advances.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                    |

Annual Report 2022

## Chunk 715

# 1. Key Audit Matter

As at December 31, 2022, the Group holds a total provision of Rs. 44,761.202 million against advances in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The determination of provision against advances based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgement and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgements/estimations and the materiality of advances relative to the overall consolidated statement of financial position of the Group, we considered the area of provision against advances as a key audit matter.

---

## Chunk 716

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

We selected a sample of loan accounts and performed the following substantive procedures:

- Checked repayments of loan/mark-up installments and tested classification of non-performing advances based on the number of days overdue;
- Evaluated the management’s assessment for classification of a borrower’s loan facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern, inspection of credit documentation and discussions with the management.

We checked the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing advances and of general provision made against performing advances in accordance with the requirements of PRs by recomputing the provision amount in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs.

We issued instructions to auditors of those overseas branches which were selected for audit, highlighting ‘Provision against advances’ as a significant risk. The auditors of those branches performed audit procedures to check compliance with regulatory requirements and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, evaluated the work performed by the component auditors and the results thereof.

# 2. Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

---

## Chunk 718

# 3. Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Chunk 719

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.



Annual Report 2022
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

| IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments                                                                         |                  |

As directed by SBP via BPRD Circular No 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023 for Bank’s having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2021. SBP via same circular has finalized the instructions on IFRS 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the Banks.

During 2022, the management of the Group has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 for holding company and one of the subsidiaries taking into account the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions whereas the requirements of this standard are incorporated for remaining subsidiaries and overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. In addition, the Group will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

An overview of the IFRS 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP:

## Chunk 733

# Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Group has adopted a governance framework requiring the Risk, Finance, Operations, Internal Audit and IT functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. IFRS 9 requires robust credit risk models that can predict Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD).

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will base on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the

---

## Chunk 734

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealised gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognised.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realised gains or losses are recognised in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognised in the income statement.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The Group has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

---

## Chunk 735

# Equity Securities

The Group expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. For equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Group will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. Expected credit losses are not recognised for equity instruments designated at FVOCI.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation to the banks till one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

---

## Chunk 736

# Debt securities and Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those passing the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those passing the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

---

## Chunk 737

# Impairment of financial assets not held at FVTPL

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for Expected Credit Losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are categorized in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced

Annual Report 2022

## Chunk 738

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

A SICR are categorized in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are categorized in ‘stage 3’.

Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SICR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default. These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For calculating ECL, the Group shall classify its financial assets under three following categories:

1. Stage 1: Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has not been a SICR since initial recognition, the Group shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
2. Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but they are not credit impaired, the Group shall recognize an allowance for the lifetime ECL for all exposures categorized in this stage based on the actual maturity profile.
3. Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: Financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. The Group shall recognize ECL on these financial assets using the higher off approach, which means that lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 is compared with regulatory provision required as per Prudential regulations.

As required by the Application Instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of Prudential Regulations (PR) issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply. An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially.

## Chunk 739

# Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Group uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR.

Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Group shall calculate 12 month ECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., stage 1 or a lifetime expected loss for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., stage 2.

At every reporting date, the Group shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset. If there is a SICR, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (stage 2 or 3).

## Chunk 740

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL framework and stage 3 provision would be higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

## Chunk 741

# Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Group’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan is yet to issue a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from January 01, 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures of adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 742

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Group will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by IFRS-9, the Group will not be restating comparatives on initial application. The cumulative impact of initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the accounting period.

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Group would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

---

## Chunk 743

# Impact on Equity of the Group

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Group’s equity at January 01, 2023 is reduction in equity of approximately Rs. 3,022.452 million, representing corresponding impact of:

- An increase of approximately Rs. 3,394.605 million (net of tax) related to impairment requirements;
- Adjustment of approximately Rs. 372.153 million related to classification and measurement requirements, other than impairment.

The Group continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption.

## Chunk 744

# Impact on regulatory capital

The Group is allowed to include provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the Group to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2022.

## Chunk 745

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The estimated impact of initial adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group’s capital ratios, without accounting for the allowed transitional arrangement, is as follows:

|                                                                          | As per adopted IFRS 9 | As per current ARS |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio                              | 15.61%                | 15.40%             |
| Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio                                            | 15.61%                | 15.40%             |
| Total Capital Adequacy Ratio                                             | 18.18%                | 17.98%             |
| CET1 available to meet buffers (as a percentage of risk weighted assets) | 8.11%                 | 7.90%              |

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime to the extent of the Group’s domestic operations, whereas the requirements of this standard are incorporated for overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

Including the above, there are other new and amended standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 but are considered not to be relevant or do not to have any significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and are therefore not detailed in these consolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 746

# 3.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

---

## Chunk 747

# a) Classification of investments

In classifying investments, the Group follows the guidance provided in SBP circulars:

- Investments classified as ‘held for trading’, are securities which are acquired with an intention to trade by taking advantage of short term market / interest rate movements and are to be sold within 90 days of acquisition.
- Investments classified as ‘held to maturity’ are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investment to maturity.
- The investments other than those in associates which are not classified as ‘held for trading’ or ‘held to maturity’ are classified as ‘available for sale’.

---

## Chunk 748

# b) Provision against advances

The Group reviews its loan portfolio to assess the amount of non-performing advances and provision required there against on regular basis. While assessing this requirement, various factors including the delinquency in the account, financial position of the borrowers and the requirements of the Prudential Regulations are considered.

The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the relevant regulations and management’s judgment as explained in note 11.5.4.

# c) Impairment of ‘available for sale’ equity investments

The Group determines that ‘available for sale’ equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. The determination of what is significant...

## Chunk 749

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Group evaluates among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, the impairment may be appropriate when there is an evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee and sector performance, changes in technology and operational/financial cash flows.

---

## Chunk 750

# d) Taxation

In making the estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Group, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. Judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.

---

## Chunk 751

# e) Fair value of derivatives

The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.

---

## Chunk 752

# f) Depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation of operating fixed assets

The management reviews the useful lives and residual values of assets annually by considering expected pattern of economic benefit that the management expects to drive from the item and the maximum period up to which such benefits are expected to be available. Any change in estimates in future years might affect the carrying amounts of the respective items of assets with a corresponding effect on the depreciation charge and impairment. Such change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. Further, the Bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

---

## Chunk 753

# g) Staff retirement benefits

Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 38 of these consolidated financial statements for the actuarial valuation of staff retirement benefit plans. Actuarial assumptions are entity’s best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post employment benefits. Changes in these assumptions in future years may affect the liability / asset under these plans in those years.

---

## Chunk 754

# h) Lease term for lease liability and right-of-use asset

The Group applies judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 755

# i) Provision and contingent assets and liabilities

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Contingent assets are not recognized and are also not disclosed until an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized and are disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

---

## Chunk 756

# 4. BASIS OF MEASUREMENT

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts and certain investments and derivative financial instruments have been marked to market and are carried at fair value. In addition, obligations in respect of staff retirement benefits and lease liabilities which have been carried at present value and right of use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liability and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

These risk management policies continue to remain robust and the Group is reviewing its portfolio regularly and conducts rapid portfolio reviews in line with emerging risks. Detailed disclosure on financial risk management has been reported in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.

# 6. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year:

---

## Chunk 758

# 6.1 Basis of consolidation

a) These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates are accounted for under the equity basis of accounting.

b) Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases / the subsidiaries are disposed off. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based on the financial statements as at December 31, 2022 and the carrying value of investments held by the Bank is eliminated against the subsidiaries’ shareholders’ equity in these consolidated financial statements. Material intra-group balances and transactions have been eliminated.

c) Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, the cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

d) Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

---

## Chunk 759

# 6.2 IFRS 16 - Lease Liability & Right-of-Use Assets

The Group enters into leasing arrangements of buildings for its branches and offices. Rental contracts are typically for a fixed period and may have extension options. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation / accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognized upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment.

## Chunk 760

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account.

The Group has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the consolidated profit or loss account on a straight-line basis.

When there is a change in scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease is accounted for as a lease modification. The lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease if modification increases the scope of lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the particular contracts, if any. When the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding adjustment is made to right-of-use asset.

# 6.3 Investments

The Group classifies its investments as follows:

# Held for trading

These are securities, which are either acquired for generating profit from short-term fluctuations in market prices, interest rate movements, dealers margin or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists.

# Held to maturity

These are securities with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity in respect of which the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.

# Available for sale

These are investments, other than those in subsidiaries and associates, that do not fall under the ‘held for trading’ or ‘held to maturity’ categories.

---

## Chunk 761

# Initial measurement

Investments are initially recognized at cost which in case of investments other than ‘held for trading’ include transaction costs associated with the investment. Transaction costs on investments held for trading are expensed in the consolidated profit and loss account.

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognized at the trade date. Trade date is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the investment.

---

## Chunk 762

# Subsequent measurement

In accordance with the requirements of the SBP, quoted securities, other than those classified as ‘held to maturity’, investments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are subsequently re-measured to market value. Surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as ‘available for sale’, is taken to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments through statement of comprehensive income in equity till disposal at which time it is recorded in consolidated profit and loss account. Surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as ‘held for trading’, is taken to the profit and loss account, currently.

Unquoted equity securities (excluding investments in subsidiaries and associates) are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. Break-up value of equity securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available financial statements. Investments classified as ‘held to maturity’ are carried at amortized cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

## Chunk 763

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# Investments in Associates

Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in the consolidated profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

---

## Chunk 764

# Impairment

Provision for impairment in the values of securities (except debentures, participation term certificates and term finance certificates) is made currently. Impairment of ‘available for sale’ equity investments is discussed in 3.4(c). Provisions for impairment in value of debentures, participation term certificates and term finance certificates are made as per the requirements of the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. Impairment against investment in associates is assessed as per the requirements of IAS 36.

---

## Chunk 765

# 6.4 Sale and repurchase agreements

Securities sold subject to a repurchase agreement (repo) are retained in these consolidated financial statements as investments and the counter party liability is included in borrowings. Securities purchased under an agreement to resell (reverse repo) are not recognized in these consolidated financial statements as investments and the amount extended to the counter party is included in lending’s to financial institutions. The difference between the purchase / sale and re-sale / re-purchase price is recognized as mark-up income / expense on a time proportion basis, as the case may be.

---

## Chunk 766

# 6.5 Advances

Advances are stated net of specific and general provisions. Specific provision is determined on the basis of the Prudential Regulations and other directives issued by the SBP and charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. Provisions are held against identified as well as unidentified losses. Provisions against unidentified losses include general provision in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Prudential Regulations for Consumer Financing and Prudential Regulations for Small and Medium Enterprise Financing issued by the SBP and provision based on historical loss experience on advances. General provisions pertaining to overseas advances are made in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory authorities of the respective countries. Advances are written off when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Leases where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. A receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments including any guaranteed residual value. Finance lease receivables are included in advances to the customers.

In Murabaha transactions, the Group purchases the goods through its agent or client and after taking the possession, sells them to the customer on cost plus profit basis either in a spot or credit transaction. Under Murabaha financing, funds disbursed for purchase of goods are recorded as ‘Advance against Murabaha finance’. On culmination of Murabaha i.e. sale of goods to customers, Murabaha financing are recorded at the deferred sale price. Goods purchased but remaining unsold at the statement of financial position date are recorded as inventories.

The Group values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories represents actual purchases made by the Group / customers as the agent of the Group for subsequent sale.

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

In Ijarah financing, the Group provides the asset on pre-agreed rentals for specific tenors to the customers. Ijarah assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are disclosed as part of ‘Islamic financing and related assets’. The rental on Ijarah under Islamic Financial Accounting Standard - 2 Ijarah (IFAS 2) are recorded as income / revenue. The Group charges depreciation from the date of recognition of Ijarah of respective assets to Mustajir. Ijarah assets are depreciated over the period of Ijarah using the straight line method. Impairment of Ijarah assets is determined in accordance with the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

In Diminishing Musharaka based financing, the Group enters into Musharaka based on Shirkat-ul-Milk for financing and agreed share of fixed assets (example: house, land, plant, machinery or vehicle) with its customers and enters into period profit payment agreement for the utilization of the Group’s Musharaka share by the customer.

In Istisna financing, the Group acquires the described goods to be manufactured by the customer from raw material of its own and deliver to the Group within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Group along with profit.

In Salam financing, the Group pays full in advance to its customer for buying specified goods / commodities to be delivered to the Group within an agreed time. The goods are then sold and the amount financed is received back by the Group along with profit.

In Running Musharaka based financing, the Group enters into financing with the customer based on Shirkat-ul-Aqd or Business Partnership in the customer’s operating business where the funds can be withdrawn or refunded during the Musharakah period.

## Chunk 768

# 6.6 Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets other than land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Buildings are carried at revalued amount less any accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses, if any. Cost of property and equipment of foreign operations includes exchange differences arising on currency translation at year-end rates.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. These are transferred to specific assets as and when assets become available for use.

Depreciation on all fixed assets (excluding land) is charged using the straight line method in accordance with the rates specified in note 12.2 to these consolidated financial statements and after taking into account residual value, if any. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use while no depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent, professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. An increase arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of fixed assets account. A decrease arising on revaluation of fixed assets is adjusted against the surplus of that asset or, if no surplus exists, is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account as an impairment of the asset.

A surplus arising subsequently on an impaired asset is reversed through the consolidated profit and loss account up to the extent of the original impairment.

Surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit.

Gains / losses on sale of property and equipment are credited / charged to the profit and loss account currently, except that the related surplus on revaluation of land and buildings (net of deferred taxation) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

## Chunk 770

# 6.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized from the month when these assets are available for use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible assets are amortized over its estimated useful lives over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

---

## Chunk 771

# 6.8 Impairment

The carrying amount of assets are reviewed at each reporting date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. If such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amounts. The resulting impairment loss is taken to the consolidated profit and loss account except for impairment loss on revalued assets, which is adjusted against the related revaluation surplus to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the surplus on revaluation of that asset.

# 22.1

Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Group, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Group or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

# 22.2

Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

38.15 The defined benefit plans may expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

- Investment risk: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.
- Longevity risk: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.
- Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.
- Withdrawal rate risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Group as ‘held to maturity’. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.4 to these consolidated financial statements.

The maturity and repricing profile and effective rates are stated in note 45.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities other than those carried at fair value and disclosed in note 41.1 are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

## Chunk 911

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Stress Testing

Credit Risk stress testing is a regular exercise. Group’s credit exposures including funded and non-funded facilities are subjected to stress tests. This exercise is conducted on a quarterly basis through assigning shocks to all assets of the Group and assessing its resulting affect on capital adequacy inline with SBP requirements.

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global lowered the country’s sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained elevated through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of 27.32% in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to 16%. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

# 45.2 Market Risk

Market Risk arises from changes in market rates such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and/or commodity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities resulting in a loss to earnings and capital. The Group is exposed to market risk primarily through its trading activities, which are centered in the Treasury and Foreign Exchange Group and the Capital Market Division. Market risk also arises from market-making, facilitation of client business and proprietary positions in equities, fixed income and interest rate products and foreign exchange, which exposes bank to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk.

The Group’s Market Risk Management structure consists of Risk Management & Portfolio Review Committee (RM&PRC) of the Board, Management Credit and Risk Committee, ALCO and independent Market Risk Management Division reporting directly to Group Head Risk Management. Market Risk function works in close partnership with the business segments to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Group and to define market risk policies and procedures. Market Risk seeks to facilitate efficient risk/return management decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Group’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market risk authority, including both approval of market risk limits and approval of market risks is vested in the ALCO.

In line with regulatory requirements, the Group has clearly defined, in its Global Risk Management policy, the positions which shall be subject to market risk. The definition covers the accounting classifications as well as positions booked by different business groups under “Available for Sale” category. The assets subject to trading book treatment are frequently, mostly on daily basis, valued and actively managed. The positions which does not fulfill the criteria of Trading book falls under the Banking Book and are treated as per SBP requirements.

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The Group measures and manages Market Risk by using different risk parameters with combinations of various limits. Board approved Global Risk Management Policy provides guidelines for assuming controlled market risk, its monitoring and management. The approved limits are compared with the numbers generated by the market risk management systems based on the trading activity and the outstanding positions.

Besides conventional methods, the Group also uses VaR (Value at Risk) technique for market risk assessment of positions assumed by its treasury and capital market groups. In-house based solutions are used for calculating mark to market value of positions and generating VaR (value at risk) and sensitivity numbers. Thresholds for different positions are established to compare the expected losses at a given confidence level and over a specified time horizon.

A framework of stress testing, scenario analysis and reverse stress tests covering both banking and trading books as per SBP guidelines is also in place. The results of the stress tests are reviewed by senior management and also reported to the SBP.

The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk both in trading and banking books. Risk parameters along with the marked to market values of government securities held by the Group’s treasury are generated on daily basis. The risk parameters include duration, Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP), and VaR on individual security basis as well as on portfolio basis. These reports are presented to the senior management for review on a daily basis.

# Liquidity Management

The Asset Liability Committee of the Group has the responsibility for formulation of overall strategy and oversight of the Asset Liability Management function. Board has approved a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Policy (part of Risk Management Policy), which stipulates policies regarding maintenance of various ratios, funding preferences, and evaluation of Group’s liquidity under normal and stress scenarios. A framework to assess the maturity profile of non-contractual assets and liabilities is in place to supplement the liquidity management. Group’s comprehensive liquidity management framework assists it to closely watch the liquidity position through monitoring of early warning indicators and stress testing, to ensure effective and timely decision making.

The Group’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to identify measure and manage in a timely manner the liquidity risk position of the Group. The underlying policies and procedures include: Global Risk Management policy, Global Treasury Policy, Investment policy, Contingency Funding Plan, Liquidity Strategy and Limit Structure which are reviewed and approved regularly by the senior management / Board members. Moreover; the Group also prepares a ‘Contingency Funding Plan’ (CFP) to address liquidity issues in time of stress / crises situation containing early warning indicators to preempt unforeseen liquidity crises. The Group conducts Liquidity Risk Analysis on regular basis as well as Maturity of gaps are also reviewed in order to ensure diversification in terms of tenors. MCB liquidity risk framework envisages to project the Group’s funding position during temporary and long-term liquidity changes, including those caused by liability erosion and explicitly identifying quantifying and ranking all sources of funding preferences, such as reducing assets, modifying or increasing liability structure; and using other alternatives for controlling statement of financial position changes. The Group performs regular liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. The Group’s liquidity risk management approach involves intraday liquidity management, managing funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in balance sheet structure.

In view of the relaxation granted by SBP for deferral of principal and markup and for rescheduling / restructuring of loans there will be an impact on the maturity profile of the Group. The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Bank is monitoring the liquidity position and the Bank is confident that the liquidity buffer currently maintained is sufficient to cater to any adverse movement in the cash flow maturity profile.

# Managing Funding Sources

Managing funding sources, as per policy the Group maintain a portfolio of marketable securities that can either be sold outright or sold through a repurchase agreement to generate cash flows for meeting unexpected liquidity requirement. As a part of liquidity management the Group maintains borrowing relationships to ensure the continued access to diverse market of funding sources. The Group’s sound credit rating together with excellent market reputation has enabled the Group to secure ample call lines with local and foreign banks. The level of liquidity reserves as per regulatory requirements also mitigates risks. The Group’s investment in marketable securities is much higher than the Statutory Liquidity Requirements.

# Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

The Group uses a third party’s Super Derivative System which provides front end sales and structuring capabilities, end to end valuation solutions, risk management systems, back end processing and provides analytical tools to measure various risk exposures and carry out sensitivity analysis.

The goal of asset/liability management (ALM) is to properly manage the risk related to changes in interest rates, the mix of balance sheet assets and liabilities, the holding of foreign currencies, and the use of derivatives. Due to thin liquidity in the derivative market, interest rate derivatives are not actively used to manage/alter the interest rate risk profile of the Group.

Although MCB is already the majority shareholder of MCBAH, after acquiring additional MCBAH shares, MCB will be in a better position to make strategic decisions regarding MCBAH. Furthermore, MCB Live has the potential to significantly increase the reach and distribution of MCBAH's mutual funds, resulting in increased profitability. In terms of account numbers, online sales are the fastest-growing channel. Moreover, investment in MCBAH would provide MCB with diversification benefits. Fee income on the AMC business is a function of assets under management, which are largely uncorrelated with the banking sector due to distinct business dynamics. Asset management businesses offer a lucrative fee-based revenue stream to complement the banking model. Along with business dynamics, both are regulated and governed by distinct tax and regulatory frameworks and thus offer significant diversification. |

# 4. Deduction of Withholding Tax as Filer/Non-Filer and Joint Shareholders:

FBR has provided the Active Tax-Payer List (“ATL”), for identification of filer/non-filer status of the shareholders on the basis of NTN/CNIC number. In case of non-availability of valid NTN/CNIC number with the Share Registrar and Transfer Agent of the Bank, it will not be possible to identify the status of Shareholder as filer or non-filer and such shareholders will be treated as ‘Non-filer’ and the higher tax rate will be applied, accordingly. Further, Joint shareholders are also requested to communicate their percentage of shareholding to the Share Registrar and Transfer Agent of the Bank in order to calculate withholding tax applicable to each Joint shareholder based on filer/non-filer status. Kindly note that in case of non-receipt of such information, each joint shareholder will be assumed to hold equal proportion of shares and the deduction will be made accordingly.

# 7. Zakat Declaration (CZ-50):

That pursuant to the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 read with the Zakat (Collection and Refund) Rules, 1981, MCB Bank Limited (the “Bank”) is under a legal obligation and duty to deduct zakat from dividend(s) of a shareholder and to thereafter deposit the said zakat amount with the relevant Authority. To avail an exemption from the deduction of such zakat amount, a shareholder is required to provide the Bank with a duly executed declaration form i.e. CZ-50, with respect to faith and fiqh, at least 30 days prior to the first day of Ramadhan.



Annual Report 2022

The Bank has recently screened, updated and secured its record and has identified those shareholders whose CZ-50 Forms/Declarations are not available with it. Therefore, the Bank has been continuously reaching out and requesting all such shareholders to file their CZ-50 Forms/Declarations with the Bank in order to claim exemption, if applicable, from the compulsory deduction of zakat from their dividends.

In this regard, for the period starting from the first day of Ramadhan 1444 AH (2023) and ending on the 30th day of Sha’ban 1445 AH (2024), the CZ-50 forms in respect of which were required to have been submitted at least 30 days prior to the first day of Ramadhan, 1444 AH (2023), several notices have already been issued to all such shareholders through post/ courier as well as by way of publication in English and Urdu dailies having nationwide circulation. At the same time, the Bank has also formally requested the Central Depository Company of Pakistan Limited (“CDC”) and the concerned Stock Brokers to immediately provide the Bank with CZ-50 Declarations/ Form of such shareholders, if available with them.

As things stand at the moment, and all other things being equal, accordingly, on the basis of the available information, details and documentation, the Bank is legally compelled to now deduct zakat from the dividends, in respect of those shareholders whose CZ-50 Forms the Bank is still not in receipt of, despite all the aforesaid attempts made to be provided with the same.

In view of the above, it is hereby submitted that the Bank, in performance of its legal obligations, has made all reasonable attempts to inform and put to notice all its shareholders regarding deduction of zakat from their dividends, in the absence of a duly executed CZ-50 Form with the Bank. Therefore, on the first day of Ramadhan 1444 AH (2023), having no alternative but to perform its legal obligation, any zakat deducted from the dividends will be deposited by the Bank with the concerned/ relevant Authority against the name of such shareholders who have not, till date, submitted their CZ-50 Form with the Bank. In case any person is aggrieved of the deduction of zakat from his/her dividends, he/she may seek to claim a refund from the concerned Authority of the amount so deducted. The Bank, in any case, bears no legal responsibility/ obligation or any financial liability whatsoever in this regard.
