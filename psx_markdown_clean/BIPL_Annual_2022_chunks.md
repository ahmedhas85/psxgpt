# Chairman’s Review

It gives me immense pleasure to present this report to the Shareholders of BankIslami Pakistan Limited (the ‘Bank’ or ‘BankIslami’) on the role of the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) and its overall performance.

The Board is committed to ensure compliance with the best practice of Corporate Governance. The Board remained vigilant and ensured its oversight over the affairs of the Bank by setting up sub-Committees with specific mandates. These sub-Committees include members with subject matter expertise. All Board sub-Committees are chaired by independent directors, which reflect the Board’s highest level of commitment towards transparency and corporate governance.

During the year, the Board performed in-house performance evaluation of the Board, the Chairman, Individual Directors including Independent Directors, the President & CEO and Board’s Committees in line with the ‘Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ issued by the State Bank of Pakistan and the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019. The evaluation was conducted covering areas, particularly in respect to its composition, expertise, effective risk management, adequate system of internal controls and audit function. Based on the assessment results, areas of strength and improvement were identified followed by discussion on performance improvement plans with each individual Board member. The Bank had engaged the Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) as an Independent External Evaluator, which conducted the performance evaluation of the Board as a whole, its Committees and Individual Board Members for the year 2020.

With regards to Bank’s performance during the year 2022, despite highly uncertain time, BankIslami posted highest ever Profit after tax of Rs. 4,440 million during the year 2022. This performance was possible due to dedicated efforts of all of our employees and trust of our customers on BankIslami.

During the year 2022, the Bank also expanded its branch network by opening 40 new branches, while it also introduced its first state-of-the-art Digital Service Center in Karachi with an aim to provide round the clock banking services to its customers. It gives me pleasure to share that the Board of the Bank has announced cash dividend of Re. 1 per share and it will be presented in the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for approval. This is the first ever dividend announced by the Bank since its incorporation. Moving forward, sustainable dividend payout will remain at the forefront of the Bank’s strategy with a view to maximize shareholders’ long-term returns.

The Bank will continue focusing on achieving its growth targets going forward and strive to maintain the pace through active marketing strategy, branch expansion plan, process improvement by leveraging technology, expanding its digital footprint and introducing customer centric and competitive Shariah compliant products.

In these difficult times amid rising inflation in the country, the Bank stood firmly with its employees and announced a monthly inflation adhoc allowance for its low and middle cadre staff to provide a measure of relief to them in these testing times; it’s a proof of Bank’s commitment to take care of its employees’ well-being. The management of the Bank also took various measures and contributed in many ways in flood relief activities for the affected population of the Country.

# Overview on Economy & Industry Outlook

# Brief Overview on Economy

Global economic activity is experiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than seen in several decades. The cost-of-living crisis, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia-Ukraine war, global output contraction, supply chain issues and climatic changes, all have considerable impact on the global as well as domestic economic outlook. Global growth is forecasted to fall to 2.9% in 2023 which is below the historical average of 3.8%. Pakistan’s GDP growth is projected to be around 2.0% in FY23, half the pace that was anticipated in June 2022.

The main factors contributing to economic slowdown are:

1. Significant rise in inflation – inflation for the month of January 2023 accelerated to 27.6% from 24.5% in December 2022. The rise in inflation is primarily driven by increase in electricity tariffs, fuel cost and food prices. Energy and food prices rose by over 35%.
2. Natural Catastrophe – the recent devastating floods in the country added profound risk to its economic outlook. It resulted in displacement of more than 30 million people and over 800,000 heads of cattle washed away. Agriculture, particularly in the province of Sindh has also been very badly affected.
3. Dwindling Forex reserves – Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are a critical component in preserving the economic stability of the country. Due to trade deficit, debt repayments and decrease in remittance inflow, Pakistan witnessed sharp decline in its Forex reserves.
4. Political instability – current political instability weighs heavily on country’s economy. With all the adversities on ground, the political instability adds to the uncertainty about country’s macroeconomic policies. Stability on this front will help in restoring development partners’ and investors’ confidence.

40



Coping with the situation various measures are being taken. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has recently decided to increase the policy rate by 100 basis points to 17% on 23 January 2023 depicting a cumulative increase of 725 bps in the policy rate since January 2022. This is the highest policy rate since 1998. Further, in order to curb depleting foreign exchange reserves, import related payments are being closely monitored specifically relating to non-essential goods. It resulted in better management of forex reserves and current account deficit; consequently current account deficit narrowed by around 60% to $3.7 billion in H1-FY23 as against a deficit of $9.1 billion last year.

Although, monitoring of non-essential imports resulted in sharp decline in overall imports and led to a significant moderation in current account deficit however, despite moderation, challenges related to external account still persists. Moreover, depleting forex reserves creates a push on demand for USD which results in rupee devaluation and ultimately pushes inflation further.

In order to overcome rupee devaluation, bringing stability in forex reserves by unlocking multilateral and bilateral inflows, the conclusion of the pending 9th review under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is critical. The discussions between Government and IMF staff are underway. The key considerations by IMF staff related to fiscal and monetary measures include strengthening the fiscal position with permanent revenue measures, reduction in untargeted subsidies, allowing the market determined exchange rate and prevention of further accumulation of circular debt.

# Banking Industry Outlook

The banking sector of Pakistan has witnessed a positive trend during the year 2022. The balance sheet of the banking sector has expanded owing to various growth-oriented measures taken by the SBP and the Government of Pakistan (GoP) during 2021 which continued till latter half of 2022. Advances and investments grew by 17.4% and 26.7%, respectively during 2022. Private-sector advances, utilization of limits under SBP refinance schemes, and rise in investment in government securities drove the growth in the asset base. Furthermore, deposits of the banking industry also grew by 7.1% during 2022. In addition, the asset quality indicators of banks also improved, with the infection ratio decreased from 7.98% (Q4 2021) to 7.73% (Q3 2022).

Given the current economic landscape, measures taken to stabilize aggregate demand and weakening output & sales of major borrowing sectors, as well as a slowdown in consumer finance, are likely to affect the demand for private sector credit. However, the seasonal demand for credit and rising input prices would neutralize the negative impact on growth in advances. The banks are still likely to invest in government securities due to the government's need for financing, especially following recent flooding. On the liability side, deposits are anticipated to rise as benchmark rates increase which will encourage savings. Deposits are likely to be more geared towards high-yielding, remunerative products instead of non-remunerative options. As for capital adequacy, most banking companies are expected to remain compliant, as the regulator has maintained the minimum solvency requirement at 11.5%.

Alhamdulillah, Year 2022 has been a great success for BankIslami, with milestone achievements in almost all the segments of the Bank. This can be witnessed from the growth in total assets which grew by 19.31% to Rs. 487 billion. Deposits depicted a prominent rise of Rs. 71.1 billion i.e. growth of 20.63% as compared to last year. During the year 2022, Deposit base surpassed the Strategic Target of Rs. 400 billion and closed at Rs. 415.91 billion.

Despite increase in policy rates during the year, Current Account contributed around 38.1% i.e. Rs. 27.1 billion in overall deposit growth. The Bank pursued an assertive approach to augment its Current Account base. This was achieved through introducing new and innovative product offerings, expanding the sales team across the country, emphasizing on growth in trade business volumes and aggressive marketing initiatives. Consequently, the Bank's Current Account deposits rose by 20.5% to Rs. 159.57 billion in the financial year 2022.

To capitalize on the hike in policy rates during the year, the Bank seized the opportunity by offering attractive term deposit products which enabled healthy growth of 27.5% (Rs. 29.72 billion) in term deposits. Going forward, in order to continue this growth trajectory, the Bank will focus on increasing its branch network, improving the overall customer experience and developing low cost deposit products.

Monetary policy tightening measures being taken by SBP has resulted in increase in policy rates from 9.75%, at the beginning of CY 2022, to 16% by the end of CY 2022. The increase in policy rate, together with uncertain economic conditions, has resulted in slowdown in financing related activities, due to which the Bank was able to achieve growth of 12.20% in financing book (gross) as compared to growth of 35.12% achieved during last year. Composition of Consumer financing in overall financing portfolio remained at 23.19% despite regulatory measures taken to curb the demand of auto financing. Likewise financing to deposit ratio (ADR - gross) plunged to 52.98% as at December 31, 2022 which stood at 56.96% as at December 31, 2021. Infection ratio of the Bank as at December 31, 2022 increased to 9.02% from 8.7% at the end of last year. In view of prevailing economic situation, the Bank has recorded an additional general provision of Rs. 2.15 billion during the year. With the recording of additional general provision, coverage ratio of the Bank improved to 96.14% as compared to 89.57% at the end of last year.

Consequently, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) jumped from 36.21% as at December 31, 2021 to 43.22% as at December 31, 2022.

The Bank is focused on achieving a balance between growth and profitability. While it is maintaining its asset quality, it is well capitalized to meet the Basel III requirements.

Receipts of Pre-IPO proceeds against issuance of ADT-1 Sukuk, have also contributed towards improved CAR. The Bank also maintained its strong liquidity position with Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 317.37% as at December 2022.

Owing to increase in average earning assets, Bank’s top line grew by 99.46%, while on the other hand profit expense rose by 110.86% on account of increase in profit bearing liabilities, resulting in an increase of 86.63% in net spreads of the Bank. Bank’s non-funded income registered a significant increase of 69.80% as compared to last year as a result of (i) improved FX income, (ii) increase in fee earned through ADC services, (iii) gain on sale on non-banking assets and (iv) recoveries from previously expensed items. Operating expenses rose by 23.28%, mainly on account of inflationary pressure and increase in business activities. The cost to income ratio of the Bank improved to 49.83% as compared to 73.73% during last year.

All of the above contributed to achieve the highest ever profit before provisions of Rs. 12.04 billion, representing a significant increase of 251.16% from the previous year. The Bank recorded total provisions, mainly representing provisioning against non-performing financing, of Rs. 3.81 billion during the year 2022 which includes Rs. 2.15 billion worth of additional general provision, recorded as a matter of prudence based on management estimate.

# Training and Development

As a long term initiative to bring cultural change, it is imperative to focus on development of senior management of the Bank. In this respect, the Bank has designed and launched ‘BankIslami Leadership Development Program (BILD)’ with the aim to develop functional and leadership skills of the people in key leadership positions. BILD aims to improve team collaboration, team interdependencies, link the staff with the vision of the Bank and to develop high performance teams.

For stable and long-term growth of any organization, quality human resource is one of the critical success factors and the Bank acknowledges this fact. During last year, the BankIslami launched its CA students training program in collaboration with Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan. During the current year, the Bank became ACCA approved employer offering training program to ACCA part qualified or ACCA affiliates.

In 2022, 700 plus in-house training sessions were successfully conducted on a nationwide basis. Additionally, 158 staff members were also given the opportunity to receive external trainings from industry experts. Through these combined efforts, the training program was successful in equipping staff with the knowledge and skills necessary for their respective roles.

BankIslami has consistently strived to create a supportive and productive environment for its workers, and its trainee program is evidence of this commitment. In the past year, 11 batches of GTOs were hired, totaling 152 officers who have been trained in this period. Furthermore, BankIslami has provided structured training to 70 newly hired Business Development Officers (BDOs).

The Bank has also organized various trainings on Health & Wellness, Fire & Safety, and emergency preparedness, to ensure health and safety of its employees.

# Statement of Internal Control

# Statement of Management's Responsibility

The Management of the Bank is responsible to establish and maintain an adequate and effective system of internal controls with the main objective of ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Chunk 99

# Management Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Bank’s Internal Control System

Concerted and integrated efforts are made by each function of the Bank to improve the Control Environment at all levels through continuous reviewing and streamlining of procedures to prevent and rectify control deficiencies. Each department/function, under the supervision of the senior executive management, is entrusted with the responsibility to oversee rectification of control deficiencies identified by internal audit, external auditors and regulators. The control activities are being closely monitored through risk management and compliance functions being the second line of defense, ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and the Bank’s internal policies and procedures. The Shariah compliance unit is responsible to monitor and mitigate risks emanating from Shariah non-compliances. Based on the observations and weaknesses identified by control functions, internal audit and external auditors, management is continuously introducing improvements in internal control system to ensure elimination of such weaknesses to the maximum possible extent.

As a continuous process, the Bank formulates/update and review several key policies and procedures for its various lines of businesses. While formulating such policies clear line of authority and responsibility are been established in order to ascertain accountability and effective internal control system.

The scope of Internal Audit department, independent from the line management, includes assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system across the Bank, and ensure compliance with prescribed policies and procedures. All significant findings of Internal Audit assessments are periodically reported to the Board Audit Committee.

The Bank's internal control system is designed to mitigate, rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements or losses. Moreover, projection of current evaluations with respect to its effectiveness for future periods is subject to a limitation that controls may become inadequate due to changes in control environment. However, it is an ongoing process that includes identification, evaluation and mitigation of significant risks faced by the Bank.

The Bank implemented the Internal Control Guidelines issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide BSD Circular No. 07, of 2004 and had conducted a detailed exercise documenting and benchmarking existing internal processes and controls relating to financial reporting. These process and controls are reviewed and updated periodically.

76

Alhamdulillah, the Bank had successfully completed all stages of its ICFR program in accordance with the Road Map under SBP OSED Circular No. 01, dated February 07, 2014. However, this is a continuous exercise whereby all new controls are documented and tested periodically to ensure their existence and effectiveness.

Considering the substantial remediation of gaps identified in the afore-mentioned exercise, SBP granted exemption for independent statutory assessment of Bank's ICFR program. Accordingly, now the Bank’s Internal Audit Department annually assess the efficacy of the ICFR and present its report to the Audit Committee for review.

Based on the results of the ongoing evaluation of internal controls carried out during the year, the Management considers that in general, the Bank’s existing internal control system is adequately designed, operating effectively, and monitored consistently. Nevertheless, the management continuously endeavors to further strengthen the internal control system of the Bank for an improved control environment.

The Board of Directors duly endorses above management’s evaluation of the internal control system.

# Recommendations/Suggestions

Based on the observations made through Shariah Review reports and feedback received from various stakeholders, we recommend the following:

1. The Bank's efforts in managing successful recoveries from the Classified (Non-Performing) financing portfolio pertaining to Defunct KASB Bank despite legal and other challenges are commendable, and should be continued:

- Completion of the automation plan of certain processes in the Pool Management and Credit Administration functions should be expedited.
- The efforts to train staff on Shariah aspects and SNCR relating to their specific roles should continue in the future and more functions should be brought into this ambit; such as Agri, SME; etc.
2. BankIslami has been playing a significant role in spreading Islamic Banking awareness in society. In light of the historical judgment of the Federal Shariat Court on prohibition of Riba and its elimination from Pakistan, the scope of the Bank's Islamic Banking awareness initiatives and activities needs to be expanded with the objective of sensitizing the masses about Riba and increasing their understanding of the significance of an Islamic economic system.
3. We appreciate the Bank's endeavors of engaging in flood relief programs conducted during the year in the wake of the most destructive floods experienced in Pakistan, and encourage it to continue fulfilling its Corporate Social Responsibility with the same zeal in other sectors.
4. The Bank's initiative of launching a Madrassah Graduate Training program is applaudable; the trainees under this program should be posted in all departments and in branches in the coming years for the Bank to benefit from their knowledge in more operational areas, along with developing them into well-rounded professionals.

# earnings

The Bank has a well-defined system in place which is sound enough to ensure that any prohibited by Shariah have been credited to charity account and are being properly utilized:

The Bank has complied with the SBP's instructions on profit and loss distribution and pool management.

The Shariah Board has been provided adequate resources enabling it to discharge its duties effectively.

The level of awareness, capacity and sensitization of the staff, management and the BOD in appreciating the importance of Shariah compliance in the products and processes of the Bank is found to be satisfactory. However, the management should continue to take measures to further improve the level of awareness.

We end this report with best wishes to the Islamic finance industry-

BankIslami Charity Fund, Corporate Social Responsibility And Sustainability Report

## Chunk 123

# OUR PHILOSOPHY

BankIslami's motto is to "Save Humanity from Riba". Therefore, BankIslami has always embraced Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as one of its core beliefs that consistently replenishes the heart of the organization: Being an Islamic bank; the scope of our welfare activities includes all segments of society with a special focus towards the well-being of the neglected sectors of the society:

---

## Chunk 124

# CHARITY FUND

Islamic Banks cannot charge late payment penalty to their customers since it falls under the ambit of Riba. However, to maintain financial discipline and to prevent deliberate delinquencies they use charity imposition as a tool of deterrence: The amount given by the customers in Charity Account against their delays is utilized by BankIslami, as a Trustee; purely for charitable purposes.

The Charity amount received was utilized to provide assistance to renowned charitable institutions working primarily in the areas of healthcare, education, poverty alleviation and disaster relief. BankIslami had a special focus towards flood relief activities in light of the devastating floods which hit Pakistan this year: A detailed account of the activities is provided in this report. Furthermore, following is a breakup of the Charity Funds Utilization by BankIslami:

# Flood Relief Activities

Last year, our country faced one of the biggest and deadliest crises of the decade in the form of flash floods. The rainfalls and floods caused extreme damage throughout the country, specifically in Baluchistan and Sindh, destroying infrastructure and facilities at a major level that brought hardships and distress for millions of country-fellows. Taking into consideration the magnitude of the disaster, BankIslami quickly formulated a plan to do all it could to provide relief. This included not just monetary support but on-ground work.

As a first action of defense, BankIslami released emergency funds to the tune of around Rs 6.8 million to different NGOs for procurement of food, medicine, temporary shelter, and other necessities as per the requirement and the situational demands. Secondly, BankIslami was the first in the banking industry to engage with Pakistan Armed Forces to ensure that flood relief goods are distributed in far-flung areas where access remained restricted for civic agencies. To facilitate and speed up the process, the Bank sent its employees in the form of volunteers to PAF Museum, where over 50 staff remained involved in the assortment and packaging of relief goods for over a month. Furthermore, BankIslami successfully procured and delivered to the Armed Forces over 23 trucks of ration (food items), 833 tents, medicines, 10,000 bottles of mosquito repellents, and other relief items for onward distribution.

As another major initiative, BankIslami collaborated with Pakistan Air Force, AFAD (Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority), Baitussalan Welfare Trust, and Karachi Relief Trust for the establishment of a Tent City (20 tents) for flood affectees at Bholari (near Nooriabad, Sindh). Anti-Mosquito Spray Drives were facilitated in Kotri and other Kachi Abadis around the river bank in the Hyderabad region. A series of events was conducted which included distribution of ration, medicines, mosquito nets, blankets, and clothes to flood affectees in Upper and Central Sindh, i.e., Fir Wassan, Mehrabpur, Larkana, Johi (Dadu), Sehwan, Fir Goth, Thari Mirwah, Mehrabpur, etc.



Annual Report 2022

BankIslami also collaborated with different institutions to organize nine (9) medical camps for the flood affectees. These medical camps were organized at Dera Ismail Khan; Nawabshah; Mehar (Dadu); Jhuddo, Mirpurkhas; Malir Tent City, etc. where medical assistance was provided and medicines were distributed among flood affectees.

Focusing on the rehabilitation phase, the Bank facilitated and financed the construction of homes for the affectees at Basti Lanjwani (village near Jampur, Punjab). Alhamdulillah, 05 homes were completed during the year and a small ceremony was held in which keys and house plates were handed over to the affectees. Additionally, more homes are also being constructed for under-privileged affectees. The Bank is now focusing on efforts to kick-start livelihood for the affectees in order to give them a chance at a sustainable future. Overall, the Bank's contribution to flood relief is over Rs. 33 Million in numbers, and untiring efforts as detailed above.

Finally, as a token of appreciation for our humble efforts in the flood relief activities, BankIslami received an award and recognition from HANDS organization at an event held in collaboration with iCare Foundation. Let us pray that the affectees overcome their hardships, and let us all undertake to build a better and sustainable Pakistan.

| Provision against Islamic financing, related assets and advances (Refer Note 12.16) | The Bank's Islamic financing portfolio includes fund-based and non-funded financing facilities. The portfolio includes corporate financing to several public sector entities and large to small size businesses operating in the private sector; as well as consumer financing to individuals. As per the Bank's accounting policy (refer note 7.4.14 to the financial statements), the Bank determines provisions against non-performing financing exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision against corporate and consumer financing in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning against loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Bank's credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision against financing, therefore, involves use of the following audit procedures:- Assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of manual and automated controls over classification and grading of customers, including controls over correct classification of non-performing financing on time-based criteria.
- Controls over monitoring of financing with higher risk of default.
- The accuracy of data input into the system used for credit grading.
- In accordance with the regulatory requirement, we sampled and performed the following substantive procedures for sample loan accounts:
- Verified repayments of loan profit installments and checked that non-performing financing have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue.
- Examined watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances. |

of management judgment, on a case to case basis, taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Bank. In view of the significance of this area in terms of its impact on the financial statements and the level of involvement of management's judgment, we identified provision as a significant area of audit judgment and a key audit matter.

How the matter was addressed in our audit:

- discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers; formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate.
- Checked the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing financing and of general provision made against consumer finance by recomputing the provision amount after considering the benefit of forced sales value, if any; in accordance with the criteria prescribed under the PRs.
- Where the management has not identified indicators displaying impairment, reviewed the credit history, account movement; financial ratios, report on security maintained and challenged the management's assessment based on our view of the credit from the review of credit file.

# Impairment testing of goodwill

As at 31 December 2022, intangible assets include goodwill amounting to Rs. 2,944.297 million acquired as a result of scheme of amalgamation as disclosed in note 14.2 to the financial statements. Goodwill is required to be annually assessed for impairment under IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'. Accordingly, management has performed an impairment test of the goodwill which is subjective in nature due to assumptions made about future performance.

As disclosed in note 14.2, the Bank uses a discounted cash flow model to determine value in use, on the basis of certain key assumptions.

## Chunk 151

# Our audit procedures, amongst others, included the following:

- Evaluated the model used in determining the value in use as well as assessing the discount rate used;

- Involved our internal valuation specialists to review and evaluate management's key assumptions used in impairment calculations;
- Performed sensitivity analyses around the key assumptions used in the models;

# Information other than the Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information: The Other Information comprises the information included in the Bank's Annual Report but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Chunk 154

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report; however, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation:

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.

The significant accounting areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank's unconsolidated financial statements or where judgment was exercised in the application of the accounting policies are as follows:

- (a) Classification and valuation of investments in accordance with the Bank’s policy (notes 7.3 and 11).

- (c) Determination of forced sales value of underlying securities of non-performing Islamic financing and related assets and advances (note 12.17.5).
- (d) Impairment of investments in equity instruments of subsidiary, associates and non-associate entities (notes 7.3.5 and 11).
- (e) Determination of lease term and incremental benchmark rate for lease contract of various properties used by Bank's branches (notes 7.5.3, 13 & 21).
- (f) Staff retirement benefits (notes 7.11 and 39).
- (g) Revaluation and depreciation / amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets (notes 7.5, 13.2 and 14).
- (h) Valuation of non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (notes 7.7 and 16.1).
- (i) Assumption and estimation in recognition of provision for taxation (current and prior years) and deferred taxation (notes 7.6, 15 and 34).
- (j) Estimation of other provisions and contingent liabilities (notes 25 and 33).

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

# 7.20 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, if any. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Bank's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the unconsolidated profit and loss account as bargain purchase.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 7.21 Segment reporting

A segment is a distinguishable component of the Bank that is engaged in providing products or services (business segment) or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments. The Bank's primary format of reporting is based on business segments. The Bank has defined its segments in line with the requirements of IFRS 8 - "Operating Segments".

IFRS 8 requires the entity to define operating segments based on various factors including the basis on which operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.

# 7.24 Remuneration framework

In order to align the remuneration practices in Pakistan with the international standards and best practices, the SBP issued Guidelines on Remuneration Practices through its BPRD circular no. 02 dated March 03, 2016, which were subsequently revised through BPRD Circular No. 01 dated 25 January 2017.

In accordance with these guidelines, the Bank has developed a comprehensive remuneration framework. The aim of this framework is to promote an effective risk management culture, and to ensure that the remuneration practice at the Bank is in line with the Bank's objectives taking into consideration all risks that the Bank may face. As a result, a fair, objective, transparent and sound remuneration policy, aligned with risks and responsibilities of Financial Intermediation has been put in place. The framework has been reviewed and recommended by the Board's Remuneration Committee (BRC) and approved by the Board of Directors (BoD).

Under the policy, all employees across the Bank who are materially responsible for risk taking - Material Risk Takers (MRTs), or risk controlling activities - Material Risk Controllers (MRCs) are identified. The remuneration of these MRTs and MRCs is dependent upon the achievement of performance measured through risk-adjusted balance scorecards, which include financial and nonfinancial / qualitative performance indicators including compliance with internal policies/ procedures/ controls, customer experience, as well as certain risk-adjusting factors (negative earners) such as regulatory compliance, frauds, complaints etc. All other individuals who do not fall within the criteria of MRTs and MRCs continue to be governed through the Bank's existing HR policy. The features of total compensation i.e. fixed remuneration as well as variable remuneration offered through performance bonuses have been disclosed in note 41 to these financial statements.

A certain portion of the variable compensation of the MRTs and MRCs is subjected to mandatory deferrals for a defined period, thus creating alignment between the employees' and stakeholders' interests and reinforcing that compensation is appropriately linked to longer-term sustainable performance. Deferred remuneration, especially with risk adjustments, improves risk-taking incentives because the amount ultimately received by employees can be made to depend on risk outcomes, and shall vest proportionately over the deferral period following the year of variable remuneration award, subject to any malus trigger adjustments. Under the Bank's framework, the deferred percentage decided for distribution in the year 2022 was 20 percent (2021: 50), while the deferral period is set at three years (2021: three years).

The payouts for variable compensation for the performance years 2019 and onwards, for MRTs and MRCs is based on the revised mechanism which takes into consideration factors (such as position within the organization, roles and responsibilities, risk alignment, and performance against KPIs) for differentiating the variable pays across employees or group of employees under the framework. Furthermore, the balanced scorecards used for performance assessment also take into consideration that MRCs are remunerated independently of the functions they oversee. As approved by the Board, and as allowed under the SBP's Guidelines on Remuneration Practices, the deferral amount retained for performance years is set aside and managed by the Bank internally, with a team of members from amongst the internal management responsible for oversight and subsequent payouts.

# Key assumptions used in value in use calculation

The recoverable amount of Goodwill has been determined based on value in use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial projections approved by the management of the Bank covering a five year period. The discount rates applied to cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate. The following rates are used by the Bank.

|                      | %     |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Discount rate        | 19.30 |
| Terminal growth rate | 5.00  |

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to following assumptions:

1. a)   Profit margins

Profit margins are based on prevailing industry trends and anticipated market conditions.
2. b)   Discount rates

Discount rates reflect management estimates of the rate of return required for each business and are calculated after taking into account the prevailing risk free rate, industry risk and business risk. Discount rates are calculated by using cost of equity of the Bank.
3. c)   Key business assumptions

The assumptions are important as they represent management assessment of how the Bank's financial position might change over the projected period. Based on the expansion plans, management expects aggressive growth in financing, investments and deposits during the projected periods and thereafter stabilization in line with industry trends. Management believes that any significant change in key assumptions, on which Goodwill's recoverable amount is based, may impact the carrying amount to further exceed its recoverable amount. Value in use calculation of Goodwill are sensitive to changes in assumptions for profit rate spreads, Non-Funded Income (NFI), long term growth rates and discount rates.
4. d)   Sensitivity to changes in assumption

The estimated recoverable amount of Goodwill exceeds its carrying amount by approximately Rs. 10,649.454 million. Management has identified two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount that these two assumptions are required to change individually in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

|                      | %      |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Discount rate        | 6.70   |
| Terminal growth rate | (3.10) |

14.3  The amount of goodwill that will be deductible for taxable purposes is Rs. 5,896.832 million. The difference represents the fair value benefit of the financial assistance granted by the State Bank of Pakistan.

The Bank has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 2,213.364 million as at December 31, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Bank would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 863.212 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Bank, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realisability of the deferred tax asset.

The Bank had purchased 10,000 certificates on June 25, 2009 of first WAPDA sukuk through a negotiated transaction for a cash consideration of Rs. 50.228 million having face value of Rs. 50 million. These certificates were available in the seller’s Central Depository Company (CDC) account and on completion of the transaction were transferred to the Bank’s CDC account. However, the periodic Ijarah Rental dues were not paid to the Bank on the plea that there exists certain discrepancy with respect to ownership of the asset. The amount has been shown under "other assets" as the certificates were matured in 2012 as per the terms of the sukuk issue. The Bank has not recognized any provision in respect of the above amount as it is fully secured through a lien over a deposit account.

# 21.3.2 Charity was not paid to any staff of the Bank or to any individual / organization in which a director or his spouse had any interest at any time during the year.

# 21.4

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the Bank has not reversed the Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) provided in the earlier audited financial statements.

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics of all pools

The 'General Deposit Mudarabah Pool' for both local and foreign currency is to cater all depositors of the Bank and provide profit / loss based on actual returns earned by the pool. Depositors are Rabb-ul-Maal as they are the provider of capital while the Bank acts as Mudarib by investing these funds in business. Since there are more than one Rabb-ul-Maal (depositor), their mutual relationship is that of Musharakah. Profit is shared among Mudarabah partners (Bank and depositors) as per pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. Whereas, profit sharing among the depositors is based on pre-assigned weightages. Loss, if any, is borne by Rabb-ul-Maal as per the principles of Mudarabah.

"The 'IERS Pool' caters to the 'Islamic Export Refinance Scheme' requirements based on the guidelines issued by the SBP. In this Scheme, SBP enters into a Musharakah arrangement with the Bank for onward financing to exporters and other blue chip companies on the basis of Shariah compliant modes such as Murabahah, Istisna, etc. Under the scheme, SBP is required to share in profit and loss of the Bank's IERS Musharakah pool. IERS pool consists of blue chip companies to whom the Bank has provided financing facilities on Shariah compliant modes including IERS facility. Profit is shared according to an agreed weightage and loss is shared according to the investment ratio.

The 'Special Mudarabah Deposits Pools' for local and foreign currency are created to attract and retain clients expecting specific returns. The funds received against these deposits are invested in various Shariah compliant assets.

The 'Treasury Pools' are managed on the basis of Musharakah and Wakalah, wherein the Bank and partner (Financial Institution) share actual return earned by the pool according to pre-defined profit sharing ratio.

The 'other specific Musharakah pool' assets comprise of consumer housing finance portfolio, sukuk and the related liability of the pool comprises of Musharakah acceptance from a financial institution. This pool is created to fund the housing finance portfolio.

The risk characteristic of each pool mainly depends on the asset and liability profile of each pool. The pool is exposed to following kinds of risks:

1. Asset Risk: The pool is exposed to Asset Risk which is the risk that is associated with Islamic mode of finance(s) applied / used under the transaction structure(s). The Bank has prepared detailed product manuals in order to identify and properly mitigate such risk. The Bank also analyses transaction structure of each customer to further ensure proper safeguard of depositors' interest. The review is done by experienced team of professionals having considerable experience in the field of Islamic banking and finance. Nevertheless since Islamic banking is a nascent industry, we believe that the process of further improvement will continue as the business grows.
2. Credit Risk: Credit Risk is the risk which is associated with financing that is mitigated through safeguards through available standards within Shariah guidelines as disclosed in note 47.1 to the unconsolidated financial statements.

Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components:

Gross income (Revenue less cost of goods sold and after deduction of other direct expenses), generated from relevant assets is calculated at the end of the month. The income is shared between the Bank and the depositors as per agreed profit sharing ratio after deduction of commingled Bank's equity share on pro rata basis. The residual is shared among depositors as per agreed weightages. These weightages and profit sharing ratios are declared by the Bank in compliance with the requirements of the SBP and Shariah.

The allocation of income and expenses to different pools is based on pre-defined basis and accounting principles / standards. Direct expenses are charged to respective pool, while indirect expenses are borne by the Bank as Mudarib. The direct expenses charged to the pool are direct cost in financing / investment transactions (i.e. Murabahah, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Istisna, Tijarah Financing, Salam etc.) and depreciation of Ijarah assets. The general and specific provisions created against non-performing Islamic financing and related assets and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives have been borne by the Bank as Mudarib.

# 39.10  Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

|                                                      | 2022    | 2021    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1% increase in discount rate                         | 612,851 | 462,329 |
| 1% decrease in discount rate                         | 684,355 | 579,085 |
| 1 Year increase in Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate | 646,660 | 515,960 |
| 1 Year decrease in Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate | 646,662 | 515,961 |

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognized within the Unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position.

# 39.15   Risks

Though its defined benefit gratuity plan, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Investment Risks: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.
- Longevity Risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.
- Salary Increase Risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.
- Withdrawal Risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 42 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and acceptances cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

## Chunk 357

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# 47 RISK MANAGEMENT

The objective of Risk Management is to effectively manage uncertainties that arise in the normal course of business activities. The risk management function is one of the most important areas of the banking business, and covers a wide spectrum of financial business risk class; including Credit, Market, Liquidity, Operational etc. The Bank follows effective risk governance which commensurate well with its current size and structure. As a prelude to countering the financial debacle of the recent past, the Basel Committee (Internationally) is raising the resilience of the banking sector by strengthening the regulatory capital framework, essentially building on the three pillars of the Basel II structure. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. SBP, while being cognizant of the various reforms in the offing, is reviewing the impact of Basel III (B3) guidelines on the capital structure and CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio) through quantitative impact studies. Accordingly, the SBP has implemented first phase of Basel III framework with effect from December 31, 2013.

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

A well formulated policy and procedure is critical to an effective Risk Management framework; it then needs to be reinforced through a strong control culture that promotes sound risk governance. The Bank's Risk Management Framework has been developed keeping in mind, that:

- To be effective, control activities should be an integral part of the regular activities of the Bank;
- Every loss or near miss event should provide some Key Learning Outcome (KLO), helping and promoting a better risk identification and mitigation;
- While the reward may well commensurate the level of risk, it has to be viewed in entirety and not in isolation; and
- Critical decision making should be based on relevant research, proper analysis and effective communication within the Bank.

---

## Chunk 372

# Strategic Level

At the strategic level, the risk related functions are approved by the senior management and the Board. These include: defining risks, setting parameters, ascertaining the institution's risk appetite, formulating strategy and policies for managing risks and establishing adequate systems and controls to ensure that overall risk remains within acceptable level and the reward compensates for the risk taken.

---

## Chunk 373

# Macro Level

It encompasses risk management within a business area or across business lines. Generally the risk management activities performed by middle management or units devoted to risk reviews fall into this category. Periodical review of various portfolios; stress test and scenario analysis for portfolio resilience; application of statistical tools and information in time series for developing strong inferences are all performed at this level.

---

## Chunk 374

# Micro Level

Risk management at micro level, is of critical importance. This function if performed with diligence and understanding, can be of maximum benefit to the organization. Micro level risk management includes:

- Business line acquisition, strong adherence to the credit and other related criteria.
- Middle Office monitoring function for a sound risk assessment of various risks inherent in treasury operations.
- Detailed review of various processes and operating procedures, for operational and other risk related assessments.

# Risk appetite of the Bank

The risk appetite of the Bank is an outcome of its corporate goal, economic profitability, available resources (size and business life cycle) and most significantly; the controls. The Bank believes in a cautious yet steady approach towards its business objectives and takes a holistic view of its investment and financing requirement.

This approach is primarily based on a viable portfolio build-up with a long-term view; key consideration being the health of various portfolios.

---

## Chunk 376

# Risk organization

A strong organizational set-up, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities permits a higher level of articulation of the Bank's risk mandate, establishment of a structure that provides for authority, delegation and accountability, and development of control framework. Risk management cannot live in a vacuum; in order to be effective, it has to be run at an enterprise level. Risk governance must involve all relevant parties and should be sanctioned by the Bank's leadership.

The risk management function at the Bank, along with the different committees including ALCO (Asset Liability Committee) and MCC (Management Credit Committee), RMC (Risk Management Committee of the Board) manage and adhere to the risk management policies and procedures, with an explicit aim to mitigate/manage risk in line with the Bank's objectives.

---

## Chunk 377

# Business line accountability

One of the most important features of the risk management process is the business line accountability. Business has to understand the risk implication of specific transaction on the business/portfolio. Some specific risks e.g. reputation risk affects the entire banking business and is not limited to one business line or the other. At BankIslami, as in any other reputable organization, responsibility comes with accountability. Each business segment is responsible for the profit/loss of the business. The management of risk is as much a line function as it is supports.

Business lines are equally responsible for the risks they are taking. Because line personnel understand the risks of the business. Lack of an understanding of this by the line management may lead to risk management in isolation.

## Chunk 378

# 47.1 Credit Risk

The Bank manages credit risk by effective credit appraisal mechanism, approving and reviewing authorities, limit structures, internal credit risk rating system, collateral management and post disbursement monitoring so as to ensure prudent financing activities and sound financing portfolio under the umbrella of a comprehensive Credit Policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit Risk has certain sub-categories as follows:

1. Price risk
There is a risk that the asset repossessed due to default of the customer may be sold or leased out to another party at a price lower than the original contract price.
2. Counter party risk
The risk that the counter-party defaults during the term of a transaction (Murabahah, Diminishing Musharakah etc.).
3. Settlement risk
The risk that the counter-party does not meet its commitments at the maturity of the transaction after the Bank has already met its commitments.
4. Country risk
Country Risk can be defined as the risk of adverse impact of certain factors on a country’s specific economic, political and social scenario which affects the ability of the country (or a borrower in that country) to repay its obligations. Country risk may be a combination of Transfer Risk and Sovereign Risk.

# 47.2 Market Risk

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-and-off balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices e.g. fluctuations in values in tradable, marketable or leasable assets. The risks relate to the current and future volatility of market values of specific assets and of foreign exchange rates and benchmark yields.

The Bank uses various tools and techniques to assess market risk including but not limited to full valuation, stress testing, scenario analysis, VaR. These assessment methods enable the Bank to estimate changes in the value of the portfolio, if exposed to various risk factors.

Moreover, since the Bank does not deal in interest based products, the impact of the above risks will be very minimal. The Bank does not have positions or forward exchange contracts giving mismatches of maturity unless such risks have been taken care of through some other mechanism.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity, gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 47.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the risk of loss arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates. In the normal course of conducting commercial banking business, which ranges from intermediation only to taking on principal risk as dealer or as counterparty, the Bank purchases or sells currencies in today / ready and gives or receives unilateral promises for sale or purchase of FX at future dates in a long or short position in different currency pairs. These positions expose the Bank to foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, the Bank primarily uses notional principal limits at various levels to control the open position, and ultimately the residual foreign exchange risk of the Bank. The Bank also strictly adheres to all associated regulatory limits.

Following is the summary of the assets of the Bank subject to foreign exchange risk.

# 47.3 Operational Risk

Operational Risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external / internal events. The risk is different from the others, since it has a greater level of uncertainty and may be termed as a little difficult to measure. The Bank believes that prudence should be lived and breathed through the organizational culture.

At a more formal level, the Bank has strengthened its risk management framework by developing policies, guidelines and manuals. Operational and other risk assessment tools e.g. Risk Control and Self Assessment (RCSA) are being effectively used to assess, mitigate and monitor possible risks that may arise in any of the Bank’s financial products or departments. Operational Loss Database (OLD) records all the internal / external potential operational losses which helps the management understand the causes and impact of these risks.

## Chunk 402

# 47.3.1 Operational Risk-Disclosures Basel II Specific

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for assessing the capital charge for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge is calculated by multiplying average annual gross income of the bank over the past three years with 15% as per guidelines issued by State Bank of Pakistan.

To reduce losses arising from operational risk, the Bank has strengthened its risk management framework by developing strategies, policies, guidelines and manuals. It also includes risk and control self-assessment, key risk indicator, loss data management, improving efficiency and effectiveness of operations and improving quality of human resource through training and mitigation of operational risk.

# 47.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential loss to the Bank arising from its inability either to meet its obligations (financial) or to fund increases in assets as they fall due without incurring unacceptable costs or losses.

BankIslami Pakistan Limited's liquidity at various levels (day to day, short term, long term) is managed by the Treasury along with the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which is one of the most important management level committees. Its role cannot be overemphasized here, it serves as a part of the critical trio with risk management and treasury department, monitoring and maintaining key liquidity ratios, a viable funding mix, depositor concentration, reviewing contingency plans etc.

Liquidity risk is defined as the potential loss arising from the Bank's inability to meet in an orderly way its contractual obligations when due. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank's activities and in the management of its assets. The Bank maintains sufficient liquidity to fund its day-to-day operations, meet customer deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity, meet customers' demand for new financings, participate in new investments when opportunities arise, and to meet any other commitments. Hence, liquidity is managed to meet known as well as unanticipated cash funding needs.

Bank calculates the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis as per SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD circular no 08 dated June 23, 2016. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of the Bank which requires banks to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-days period. As of December 31, 2022, Bank’s LCR stood at 317.37% against the SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.

The objective of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress. Banks are expected to meet the NSFR requirement of at least 100% on an ongoing basis.

# Governance of Liquidity risk management

Liquidity and related risks are managed through standardized processes established in the Bank. Board and senior management are apprised about the liquidity profile of the Bank on a periodic basis so as to ensure proactive liquidity management and to avoid abrupt shocks. The management of liquidity risk within the Bank is undertaken within limits and other policy parameters set by ALCO, which meets monthly and reviews compliance with policy parameters. Day to day monitoring is done by the treasury while overall compliance is monitored and coordinated by the ALCO and includes reviewing the actual and planned strategic growth of the business and its impact on the statement of financial position and monitoring the Bank’s liquidity profile and associated activities.

Bank’s treasury function has the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing the bank’s liquidity and funding strategy. Treasury Middle Office being part of the Risk management group is responsible for the independent identification, monitoring & analysis of risks inherent in treasury operations. The Bank has in place duly approved Treasury investment policy and strategy along with liquidity risk tolerance/appetite levels. These are communicated at various levels so as to ensure effective liquidity management for the Bank.

Funding Strategy
Bank’s prime source of liquidity is the customer’s deposit base. Within deposits, Bank strives to maintain a healthy core deposit base in form of current and saving deposits and avoid concentration in particular products, tenors and dependence on large fund providers. Further, Bank relies on Interbank placement for stop gap funding arrangements but same is less preferred source of liquidity. Within acceptance, sources of funding are also diversified to minimize concentration. Usually interbank placement is for short term. The Bank follows centralized funding strategy so as to ensure achievement of strategic and business objectives of the Bank.

## Chunk 405

# Liquidity Risk Mitigation techniques

Various tools and techniques are used to measure and monitor the possible liquidity risk. These include monitoring of different liquidity ratios like cash to deposits, financing to deposit ratio, liquid assets to total deposits, Interbank placement to total deposits and large deposits to total deposits which are monitored on daily basis against different trigger levels and communicated to senior management and to ALCO forum regularly. Further, Bank also prepares the maturity profile of assets and liabilities to monitor the liquidity gaps over different time buckets. For maturity analysis, behavioural study techniques are also used to determine the behaviour of non-contractual assets and liabilities based on historic data and statistical techniques. The Bank also ensures to maintain statutory cash and liquidity requirements all times.

---

## Chunk 406

# Liquidity Stress Testing

As per SBP BSD Circular No. 1 of 2012, liquidity stress testing is being conducted under various stress scenarios. Shocks include the withdrawals of deposits and increase in assets, withdrawals of wholesale / large deposits & interbank placement and utilization of undrawn credit lines etc. Results of same are escalated at the senior level so as to enable the senior management to take proactive actions to avoid liquidity crunch for the Bank.

## Chunk 407

# Contingency Funding Plan

Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is a part of liquidity management framework of the bank which identifies the trigger events that could cause a liquidity crisis and describes the actions to be taken to manage the crisis. At Bank, a comprehensive liquidity contingency funding plan is prepared which highlights liquidity management chain that needs to be followed. Responsibilities and crisis management phases are also incorporated in order to tackle the liquidity crisis. Moreover, CFP highlights possible funding sources, in case of a liquidity crisis.

## Chunk 408

# Main drivers of LCR Results

Main drivers of LCR Results are High Quality Liquid Assets and Net cash outflows. Outflows are mainly deposit outflows net of cash inflows which consist of inflows from financing and money market placements up to 1 month. The inputs for calculation of LCR are as prescribed by the regulator.

---

## Chunk 409

# Composition of High Quality Liquid Assets - HQLA

High Quality Liquid Assets composed of Level-1 Assets which can be included in the stock of liquid assets at 100% of their market value. Bank has taken Cash & treasury balances, Investments in Government of Pakistan backed Sukuks classified as Available for Sale category and foreign currency placements issued by sovereigns. Further, Level 2-A asset category includes investment in corporate sukuk.

## Chunk 410

# Concentration of Funding Sources

Being a commercial bank, it relies on funds provided by depositors. However the Bank has been continuously improving upon its ratio of core deposits. Current and Saving accounts consist of 66.89% of total deposits, term deposits are 33.11% and acceptance from SBP and financial institutions is 5.06% of total deposits. Moreover the Bank does not rely on top few depositors to meet its funding requirements. This clearly shows that the funding sources for the Bank are well diversified.

# Currency Mismatch in the LCR

Currency mismatch is minimal as FCY deposits are 3.21% of Bank’s total deposits.

# 47.5 Strategic Risk

Strategic risk arises due to wrong assumptions in strategic decision making or the failure to react correctly to long-term changes in strategic parameters. The Bank follows a deliberate low-risk strategy. Within the general constraints of its niche market the Bank is aware of the need of reducing risk. The Bank has a well established strategic planning and evaluation process which involves all levels of management and which is subject to regular review.

## Chunk 416

# 47.6 Systemic Risk

Systemic risk is the risk of a total or partial collapse of the financial system. Such a collapse could be due to technical factors or market driven (psychological reasons). Systemic risk is reduced by the activities of both national and international regulatory authorities. The Bank actively supports these organizations through its membership of the relevant banking industry association i.e. Pakistan Banks' Association (“PBA”). The Bank also takes account of systemic risk by means of careful management of counter party risks in the inter-bank market.

## Chunk 417

# 47.7 Shariah Non-compliance Risk

Shariah non-compliance risk is the risk that arises from an Islamic bank's failure to comply with the Shariah rules and principles prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan and / or the Shariah Board of the Bank. It remains the most important operational risk for an Islamic bank. Compliance of Shariah guidelines must permeate throughout the organization and its adherence should be reflected in the products and activities.

## Chunk 418

# 47.8 Shariah Compliant Forward and Future Contracts

Shariah compliant forward and future contracts are recognized at fair value. In case of equity futures, the fair value is calculated with reference to quoted market price. Shariah compliant forward and future contracts with positive market values (i.e. unrealized gains) are included in other receivables and derivatives with negative market values (i.e. unrealized losses) are included in other liabilities in the statement of financial position. The resultant gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.

| 1   | Provision against Islamic financing; related assets and advances (Refer Note 12.17) | The Group's Islamic financing portfolio includes fund-based and non-funded financing facilities. The portfolio includes corporate financing to several public sector entities and large to small size businesses operating in the private sector, as well as financing to individuals. As per the Group's accounting policy (refer note 7 4.14 to the consolidated financial statements), the Group determines provisions against non-performing financing exposures in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision against corporate and consumer financing in respect of potential credit losses in the portfolio. The Prudential Regulations require specific provisioning against loan losses on the basis of an age-based criteria which should be supplemented by a subjective evaluation of Group's credit portfolio. The determination of loan loss provision against financing, therefore, involves use of management judgment on a case to case basis taking into account factors such as the economic and business conditions, borrowers repayment behaviors and realizability of collateral held by the Group. Our audit procedures to verify provision against Islamic financing; amongst others, included the following:- Assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of manual and automated controls over classification and grading of customers including controls over correct classification of non-performing financing on time-based criteria.
- Controls over monitoring of financing with higher risk of default.
- The accuracy of data input into the system used for credit grading.
- In accordance with the regulatory requirement, we sampled and tested at least sixty percent of the total Islamic financing portfolio and performed the following substantive procedures for sample loan accounts:
* Verified repayments of loan profit installments and checked that non-performing financing have been correctly classified and categorized based on the number of days overdue.
* Examined watch list accounts and, based on review of the individual facts and circumstances, discussions with management and our assessment of financial conditions of the borrowers, formed a judgement as to whether classification of these accounts as performing was appropriate.
* Checked the accuracy of specific provision made against non-performing financing. |

# Impairment testing of goodwill

As at 31 December 2022, intangible assets include goodwill amounting to Rs. 2,991.308 million acquired as a result of scheme of amalgamation as disclosed in note 14.2 to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill is required to be annually assessed for impairment under IAS-36 "Impairment of Assets". Accordingly, management has performed an impairment test of the goodwill which is subjective in nature due to assumptions made about future performance.

As disclosed in note 14.2, the Group uses a discounted cash flow model to determine value in use on the basis of certain key assumptions. Due to the significance and impact of the assumptions and judgments involved, the impairment tests of goodwill is considered to be a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures, amongst others included the following:

- Evaluated the model used in determining the value in use as well as assessing the discount rate used;
- Compared the cash flow forecasts to approved budgets and other relevant market and economic information, as well as testing the underlying calculations;
- Involved our internal valuation specialists to review and evaluate management's key assumptions used in impairment calculations;
- Performed sensitivity analyses around the key assumptions used in the models;
- Assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.

Management is responsible for the other information. The other Information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and, doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the Companies Act, 2017, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Chunk 437

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be.

Expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs applicable in Pakistan; we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error; as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, and the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence; and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters: We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication;

# 7.20 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, if any. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Holding Company's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated profit and loss account as bargain purchase.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 7.24 Remuneration framework

In order to align the remuneration practices in Pakistan with the international standards and best practices, the SBP issued Guidelines on Remuneration Practices through its BPRD circular no. 02 dated March 03, 2016, which were subsequently revised through BPRD Circular No. 01 dated 25 January 2017.

In accordance with these guidelines, the Holding Company has developed a comprehensive remuneration framework. The aim of this framework is to promote an effective risk management culture, and to ensure that the remuneration practice at the Holding Company is in line with the Holding Company's objectives taking into consideration all risks that the Holding Company may face. As a result, a fair, objective, transparent and sound remuneration policy, aligned with risks and responsibilities of Financial Intermediation has been put in place. The framework has been reviewed and recommended by the Board's Remuneration Committee (BRC) and approved by the Board of Directors (BoD) of the Holding Company.

Under the policy, all employees across the Holding Company who are materially responsible for risk taking - Material Risk Takers (MRTs), or risk controlling activities - Material Risk Controllers (MRCs) are identified. The remuneration of these MRTs and MRCs is dependent upon the achievement of performance measured through risk-adjusted balance scorecards, which include financial and nonfinancial / qualitative performance indicators including compliance with internal policies/ procedures/ controls, customer experience, as well as certain risk-adjusting factors (negative earners) such as regulatory compliance, frauds, complaints etc. All other individuals who do not fall within the criteria of MRTs and MRCs continue to be governed through the Holding Company's existing HR policy. The features of total compensation i.e. fixed remuneration as well as variable remuneration offered through performance bonuses have been disclosed in note 41 to these financial statements.

A certain portion of the variable compensation of the MRTs and MRCs is subjected to mandatory deferrals for a defined period, thus creating alignment between the employees' and stakeholders' interests and reinforcing that compensation is appropriately linked to longer-term sustainable performance. Deferred remuneration, especially with risk adjustments, improves risk-taking incentives because the amount ultimately received by employees can be made to depend on risk outcomes, and shall vest proportionately over the deferral period following the year of variable remuneration award, subject to any malus trigger adjustments. Under the Holding Company's framework, the deferred percentage decided for distribution in the year 2021 was 50 percent, while the deferral period is set at three years.

The payouts for variable compensation for the performance years 2019 and onwards, for MRTs and MRCs is based on the revised mechanism which takes into consideration factors (such as position within the organization, roles and responsibilities, risk alignment, and performance against KPIs) for differentiating the variable pays across employees or group of employees under the framework. Furthermore, the balanced scorecards used for performance assessment also take into consideration that MRCs are remunerated independently of the functions they oversee. As approved by the Board, and as allowed under the SBP's Guidelines on Remuneration Practices, the deferral amount retained for performance years is set aside and managed by the Holding Company internally, with a team of members from amongst the internal management responsible for oversight and subsequent payouts.

# Key assumptions used in value in use calculation

The recoverable amount of Goodwill has been determined based on value in use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial projections approved by the management of the Holding Company covering a five year period. The discount rates applied to cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate. The following rates are used by the Holding Company.

| Discount rate        | 19.30 |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Terminal growth rate | 5.00  |

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to following assumptions:

1. Profit margins
Profit margins are based on prevailing industry trends and anticipated market conditions.
2. Discount rates
Discount rates reflect management estimates of the rate of return required for each business and are calculated after taking into account the prevailing risk free rate, industry risk and business risk. Discount rates are calculated by using cost of equity of the Holding Company.
3. Key business assumptions
The assumptions are important as they represent management assessment of how the Holding Company's financial position might change over the projected period. Based on the expansion plans, management expects aggressive growth in financing, investments and deposits during the projected periods and thereafter stabilization in line with industry trends. Management believes that any significant change in key assumptions, on which Goodwill's recoverable amount is based, may impact the carrying amount to further exceed its recoverable amount. Value in use calculation of Goodwill are sensitive to changes in assumptions for profit rate spreads, Non Funded Income (NFI), long term growth rates and discount rates.
4. Sensitivity to changes in assumption
The estimated recoverable amount of Goodwill exceeds its carrying amount by approximately Rs. 10,649.454 million. Management has identified two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount that these two assumptions are required to change individually in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

| Changes required for carrying amount to equal recoverable amount | %      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Discount rate                                                    | 6.70   |
| Terminal growth rate                                             | (3.10) |

# 14.3

The amount of goodwill that will be deductible for taxable purposes is Rs. 5,896.832 million. The difference represents the fair value benefit of the financial assistance granted by the State Bank of Pakistan.

15.1 The Holding Company has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 2,252.375 million as at December 31, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Holding Company would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs.878.426 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Holding Company, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realisability of the deferred tax asset.

The Holding Company had purchased 10,000 certificates on June 25, 2009 of first WAPDA sukuk through a negotiated transaction for a cash consideration of Rs. 50.228 million having face value of Rs. 50 million. These certificates were available in the seller’s Central Depository Company (CDC) account and on completion of the transaction were transferred to the Holding Company's CDC account. However, the periodic Ijarah Rental dues were not paid to the Holding Company on the plea that there exists certain discrepancy with respect to ownership of the asset. The amount has been shown under "other assets" as the certificates were matured in 2012 as per the terms of the sukuk issue. The Holding Company has not recognized any provision in respect of the above amount as it is fully secured through a lien over a deposit account.

# 21.4

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the Holding Company has not reversed the Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) provided in the earlier audited financial statements.

## Chunk 617

# Key features and risk & reward characteristics of all pools

The 'General Deposit Mudarabah Pool' for both local and foreign currency is to cater all depositors of the Holding Company and provide profit / loss based on actual returns earned by the pool. Depositors are Rabb-ul-Maal as they are the provider of capital while the Holding Company acts as Mudarib by investing these funds in business. Since there are more than one Rabb-ul-Maal (depositor), their mutual relationship is that of Musharakah. Profit is shared among Mudarabah partners (Holding Company and depositors) as per pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. Whereas, profit sharing among the depositors is based on pre-assigned weightages. Loss, if any, is borne by Rabb-ul-Maal as per the principles of Mudarabah.

"The 'IERS Pool' caters to the 'Islamic Export Refinance Scheme' requirements based on the guidelines issued by the SBP. In this Scheme, SBP enters into a Musharakah arrangement with the Holding Company for onward financing to exporters and other blue chip companies on the basis of Shariah compliant modes such as Murabahah, Istisna, etc. Under the scheme, SBP is required to share in profit and loss of the Holding Company's IERS Musharakah pool. IERS pool consists of blue chip companies to whom the Holding Company has provided financing facilities on Shariah compliant modes including IERS facility. Profit is shared according to an agreed weightage and loss is shared according to the investment ratio.

The 'Special Mudarabah Deposits Pools' for local and foreign currency are created to attract and retain clients expecting specific returns. The funds received against these deposits are invested in various Shariah compliant assets.

The 'Treasury Pools' are managed on the basis of Musharakah and Wakalah, wherein the Holding Company and partner (Financial Institution) share actual return earned by the pool according to pre-defined profit sharing ratio.

The 'Other Specific Musharakah pool' assets comprise of consumer housing finance portfolio, sukuk and the related liability of the pool comprises of Musharakah acceptance from a financial institution. This pool is created to fund the housing finance portfolio.

The risk characteristic of each pool mainly depends on the asset and liability profile of each pool. The pool is exposed to following kinds of risks:

1. Asset Risk: The pool is exposed to Asset Risk which is the risk that is associated with Islamic mode of finance(s) applied / used under the transaction structure(s). The Holding Company has prepared detailed product manuals in order to identify and properly mitigate such risk. The Holding Company also analyses transaction structure of each customer to further ensure proper safeguard of depositors' interest. The review is done by experienced team of professionals having considerable experience in the field of Islamic banking and finance. Nevertheless since Islamic banking is a nascent industry, we believe that the process of further improvement will continue as the business grows.
2. Credit Risk: Credit risk is the risk which is associated with financing that is mitigated through safeguards through available standards within Shariah guidelines as disclosed in note 47.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components:

Gross income (Revenue less cost of goods sold and after deduction of other direct expenses), generated from relevant assets is calculated at the end of the month. The income is shared between the Holding Company and the depositors as per agreed profit sharing ratio after deduction of commingled Holding Company's equity share on pro rata basis. The residual is shared among depositors as per agreed weightages. These weightages and profit sharing ratios are declared by the Holding Company in compliance with the requirements of the SBP and Shariah.

The allocation of income and expenses to different pools is based on pre-defined basis and accounting principles / standards. Direct expenses are charged to respective pool, while indirect expenses are borne by the Holding Company as Mudarib. The direct expenses charged to the pool are direct cost in financing / investment transactions (i.e. Murabahah, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Istisna, Tijarah, Salam etc.) and depreciation of Ijarah assets. The general and specific provisions created against non-performing Islamic financing and related assets and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives have been borne by the Holding Company as Mudarib.

# 39.10 Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

|                                                      | 2022    | 2021    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1% increase in discount rate                         | 612,851 | 462,329 |
| 1% decrease in discount rate                         | 684,355 | 579,085 |
| 1 Year increase in Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate | 646,660 | 515,960 |
| 1 Year decrease in Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate | 646,662 | 515,961 |

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognized within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

# 39.13 Maturity profile

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 5.53 years (2021 : 11.31 years)

Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted defined benefit obligation for the gratuity scheme is as follows:

| At December 31, 2022 | Less than a year | Between 1-2 years | Between 2-5 years | Over 5 years | Total     |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Gratuity             | 124,119          | 77,305            | 254,681           | 1,771,027    | 2,227,132 |

# 39.14 Funding Policy

Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and are based on actuarial recommendations. Expected Gratuity Expense for the next year works out to Rs. 189.636 million as per the actuarial valuation report of the Bank as of December 31, 2022.

## Chunk 631

# 39.15 Risks

Through its defined benefit gratuity plan, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Investment Risks: The risk arises when the actual performance of the investments is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.
- Longevity Risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.
- Salary Increase Risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectation and impacts the liability accordingly.
- Withdrawal Risk: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 42 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and acceptances cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Holding Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. non-observable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# 47 RISK MANAGEMENT

The objective of Risk Management is to effectively manage uncertainties that arise in the normal course of business activities. The risk management function is one of the most important areas of the banking business, and covers a wide spectrum of financial business risk class; including Credit, Market, Liquidity, Operational etc. The Holding Company follows effective risk governance which commensurate well with its current size and structure.

As a prelude to countering the financial debacle of the recent past, the Basel Committee (Internationally) is raising the resilience of the banking sector by strengthening the regulatory capital framework, essentially building on the three pillars of the Basel II structure. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. SBP, while being cognizant of the various reforms in the offing, is reviewing the impact of Basel III (B3) guidelines on the capital structure and CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio) through quantitative impact studies. Accordingly, the SBP has implemented first phase of Basel III framework with effect from December 31, 2013.

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

A well formulated policy and procedure is critical to an effective Risk Management framework; it then needs to be reinforced through a strong control culture that promotes sound risk governance. The Holding Company's Risk Management Framework has been developed keeping in mind, that:

- To be effective, control activities should be an integral part of the regular activities of the Holding Company;
- Every loss or near miss event should provide some Key Learning Outcome (KLO), helping and promoting a better risk identification and mitigation;
- While the reward may well commensurate the level of risk, it has to be viewed in entirety and not in isolation; and
- Critical decision making should be based on relevant research, proper analysis and effective communication within the Holding Company.

---

## Chunk 654

# Strategic Level

At the strategic level, the risk related functions are approved by the senior management and the Board. These include: defining risks, setting parameters, ascertaining the institution's risk appetite, formulating strategy and policies for managing risks and establishing adequate systems and controls to ensure that overall risk remains within acceptable level and the reward compensates for the risk taken.

---

## Chunk 655

# Macro Level

It encompasses risk management within a business area or across business lines. Generally the risk management activities performed by middle management or units devoted to risk reviews fall into this category. Periodical review of various portfolios; stress test and scenario analysis for portfolio resilience; application of statistical tools and information in time series for developing strong inferences are all performed at this level.

---

## Chunk 656

The risk appetite of the Holding Company is an outcome of its corporate goal, economic profitability, available resources (size and business life cycle) and most significantly, the controls. The Holding Company believes in a cautious yet steady approach towards its business objectives and takes a holistic view of its investment and financing requirement.

This approach is primarily based on a viable portfolio build-up with a long-term view; key consideration being the health of various portfolios.

## Chunk 658

# Risk organization

A strong organizational set-up, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities permits a higher level of articulation of the Holding Company's risk mandate, establishment of a structure that provides for authority, delegation and accountability, and development of control framework. Risk management cannot live in a vacuum; in order to be effective, it has to be run at an enterprise level. Risk governance must involve all relevant parties and should be sanctioned by the Holding Company's leadership.

The risk management function at the Holding Company, along with the different committees including ALCO (Asset Liability Committee) and MCC (Management Credit Committee), RMC (Risk Management Committee of the Board) manage and adhere to the risk management policies and procedures, with an explicit aim to mitigate / manage risk in line with the Holding Company's objectives.

## Chunk 659

# Business line accountability

One of the most important features of the risk management process is the business line accountability. Business has to understand the risk implication of specific transaction on the business / portfolio. Some specific risks e.g. reputation risk affects the entire banking business and is not limited to one business line or the other. At BankIslami, as in any other reputable organization, responsibility comes with accountability. Each business segment is responsible for the profit / loss of the business. The management of risk is as much a line function as it is supports.

Business lines are equally responsible for the risks they are taking. Because line personnel understand the risks of the business. Lack of an understanding of this by the line management may lead to risk management in isolation.

# 47.2 Market Risk

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-and-off balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices e.g. fluctuations in values in tradable, marketable or leasable assets. The risks relate to the current and future volatility of market values of specific assets and of foreign exchange rates and benchmark yields.

The Holding Company uses various tools and techniques to assess market risk including but not limited to full valuation, stress testing, scenario analysis, VaR. These assessment methods enable the Holding Company to estimate changes in the value of the portfolio, if exposed to various risk factors.

Moreover, since the Holding Company does not deal in interest based products, the impact of the above risks will be very minimal. The Holding Company does not have positions or forward exchange contracts giving mismatches of maturity unless such risks have been taken care of through some other mechanism.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity, gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 47.2.2 Foreign Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the risk of loss arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates. In the normal course of conducting commercial banking business, which ranges from intermediation only to taking on principal risk as dealer or as counterparty, the Holding Company purchases or sells currencies in today / ready and gives or receives unilateral promises for sale or purchase of FX at future dates in a long or short position in different currency pairs. These positions expose the Holding Company to foreign exchange risk.

# 47.3 Operational Risk

Operational Risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external / internal events. The risk is different from the others, since it has a greater level of uncertainty and may be termed as a little difficult to measure. The Holding Company believes that prudence should be lived and breathed through the organizational culture.

At a more formal level, the Holding Company has strengthened its risk management framework by developing policies, guidelines and manuals. Operational and other risk assessment tools e.g. Risk Control and Self Assessment (RCSA) are being effectively used to assess, mitigate and monitor possible risks that may arise in any of the Holding Company’s financial products or departments. Operational Loss Database (OLD) records all the internal / external potential operational losses which helps the management understand the causes and impact of these risks.

# 47.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential loss to the Holding Company arising from its inability either to meet its obligations (financial) or to fund increases in assets as they fall due without incurring unacceptable costs or losses. Holding Company's liquidity at various levels (day to day, short term, long term) is managed by the Treasury along with the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which is one of the most important management level committees. Its role cannot be overemphasized here, it serves as a part of the critical trio with risk management and treasury department, monitoring and maintaining key liquidity ratios, a viable funding mix, depositor concentration, reviewing contingency plans etc.

Liquidity risk is defined as the potential loss arising from the Holding Company's inability to meet in an orderly way its contractual obligations when due. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Holding Company's activities and in the management of its assets. The Holding Company maintains sufficient liquidity to fund its day-to-day operations, meet customer deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity, meet customers' demand for new financings, participate in new investments when opportunities arise, and to meet any other commitments. Hence, liquidity is managed to meet known as well as unanticipated cash funding needs.

Holding Company calculates the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a monthly basis as per SBP Basel III Liquidity Standards issued under BPRD Circular No 08 dated June 23, 2016. The objective of LCR is to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of Holding Company which requires Holding Company to maintain sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-days period. As of December 31, 2022, Holding Company’s LCR stood at 317.37% against the SBP’s minimum requirement of 100%.

The objective of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress. Banks are expected to meet the NSFR requirement of at least 100% on an ongoing basis.

# 47.5 Strategic Risk

Strategic risk arises due to wrong assumptions in strategic decision making or the failure to react correctly to long-term changes in strategic parameters. The Holding Company follows a deliberate low-risk strategy. Within the general constraints of its niche market the Holding Company is aware of the need of reducing risk. The Holding Company has a well established strategic planning and evaluation process which involves all levels of management and which is subject to regular review.

## Chunk 694

# 47.6 Systemic Risk

Systemic risk is the risk of a total or partial collapse of the financial system. Such a collapse could be due to technical factors or market driven (psychological reasons). Systemic risk is reduced by the activities of both national and international regulatory authorities. The Holding Company actively supports these organizations through its membership of the relevant banking industry association i.e. Pakistan Banks' Association (“PBA”). The Holding Company also takes account of systemic risk by means of careful management of counter party risks in the inter-bank market.

## Chunk 695

# 47.7 Shariah Non-compliance Risk

Shariah non-compliance risk is the risk that arises from an Islamic bank's failure to comply with the Shariah rules and principles prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan and / or the Shariah Board of the Holding Company. It remains the most important operational risk for an Islamic bank. Compliance of Shariah guidelines must permeate throughout the organization and its adherence should be reflected in the products and activities.

---

## Chunk 696

# 47.8 Shariah Compliant Forward and Future Contracts

Shariah compliant forward and future contracts are recognized at fair value. In case of equity futures, the fair value is calculated with reference to quoted market price. Shariah compliant forward and future contracts with positive market values (i.e. unrealized gains) are included in other receivables and derivatives with negative market values (i.e. unrealized losses) are included in other liabilities in the statement of financial position. The resultant gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
