# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

الحمد لله رب العالمين

The Board of Directors is pleased to present the condensed interim unaudited financial statements of Meezan Bank Limited and consolidated financial statements for the half year ended June 30, 2022.

## Economy

Pakistan's economy posted a robust GDP growth of 5.97% for the fiscal year ended 30th June 2022. Exports grew strongly on account of policy support including export facilitation scheme, enhancement in coverage and loan limits under LTFF, and tariff rationalization in certain sectors. Tax collection by the Federal Board of Revenue also recorded substantial growth of 29% during fiscal year 2022.

However, the geopolitical uncertainty, arising out of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has amplified macroeconomic imbalances and global commodity prices have increased substantially. The current account deficit for the period July-May FY2022 rose to $15.2 billion while the CPI inflation rose to 11.3%. This led the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to raise the policy rate to 15 percent as part of monetary tightening which has been underway since September 2021 to tame the rising inflation. The Federal Government has also increased the income taxes on select corporate sectors, including the Banking industry, through the Federal Budget 2022-23 to fill the fiscal gap.

## Our performance

By the grace of Allah, notwithstanding these challenging economic conditions, Meezan Bank continued to deliver strong financial results during the first half year of 2022. The Bank's profit after tax for the half year ended on June 30, 2022 registered a growth of 36% to Rs 17.1 billion from Rs 12.6 billion in corresponding period last year despite higher taxation charge levied under the Finance Act 2022 by the Federal Government. Under the Finance Act 2022, the tax rate on banking companies has been increased to 49% for the year 2022 (39% normal tax and 10% Super Tax) from 39% in 2021 (35% normal tax and 4% Super Tax). As a result, the effective tax rate of the Bank for the second quarter surged to 57% while the effective tax rate for the half year ended June 30, 2022 increased to 49% versus 39% in June 2021. In addition, there is an additional penal tax charge if bank's Asset to Deposit Ratio (ADR) falls below 50% which in the case of Meezan did not apply since the Bank was able to maintain its ADR at 50% plus levels and contributed to its efficient tax management strategy.

Earnings per Share, on enhanced share capital of Rs 16.27 billion, increased to Rs 10.52 per share from Rs 7.75 per share in June 2021. The Bank remains well-capitalized with Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 17.86% being well above the minimum regulatory requirement. We are pleased to inform you that the Board has approved Rs 1.75 (17.5%) interim cash dividend for the second quarter. Further, the Board has also approved to issue 10% bonus shares. This brings the total dividend payout for the half year to Rs 3.50 (35%) along with 10% bonus shares, as Rs 1.75 per share (17.5%) interim cash dividend was paid for the first quarter of 2022.

Return on financings, investments and placements increased by 76% to Rs 88.3 billion from Rs 50.1 billion in the corresponding period last year, contributed by both higher volume of earning assets and higher benchmark Policy Rate which, on average, increased from 7.00% in the corresponding period last year to 11.23% during the current half year. The return on deposits and other dues, on the other hand, recorded more than a twofold increase closing at Rs 42.9 billion from Rs 18.9 billion in corresponding period last year due to higher average deposit volume and increase in depositors' profit rates, and other related costs.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

Fee and commission income recorded a robust growth of 50% to Rs 6.2 billion from Rs 4.1 billion in June 2021 mainly contributed by rise in debit card related fee income, trade and branch banking income. The increase in card based spend and growing volumes of digital transactions contributed to this growth. The foreign exchange income of the Bank also doubled, growing from Rs 1.6 billion to Rs 3.1 billion on account of improved trade flows and market volatility. On an overall basis, the Bank's non-funded income recorded a 57% growth from June 2021 closing at Rs 10.7 billion.

The Bank's operating and other expenses also increased by 27% to Rs 21.2 billion from Rs 16.7 billion, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with opening of 96 new branches since June 2021, high inflation, rupee devaluation and investment in IT related initiatives. However, this rise in expenses was sufficiently absorbed by growth in the Bank's total income, resulting in further improving the income efficiency ratio of the Bank to 38% from 44% in the corresponding period last year.

The total assets of the Bank crossed Rs 2.4 trillion, after registering a growth of 27% (Rs 516 billion), from December 2021 levels of Rs 1.9 trillion. The investment portfolio of the Bank doubled, growing to Rs 1.2 trillion from Rs 620 billion last year, after investment of more than Rs 600 billion in GoP Ijarah Sukuk. The resumption of regular Sukuk auction by the Government of Pakistan (GoP), coupled with the introduction of the SBP's shariah compliant OMO and standing ceiling facility has played an instrumental role in addressing the chronic liquidity management challenges historically faced by the Islamic Banking Industry (IBI) for which we remain indebted to the GoP and the SBP.

The gross ADR of the Bank remained at 53% which is in line with the Bank's strategic objective to maintain a high-quality diversified asset portfolio spread across all segments including Corporate, Commercial & SME and the Consumer segments. Despite the repayment of seasonal financing and overall economic slowdown, the Bank was able to grow its gross financings book to Rs 827 billion – a growth of 6% over Rs 777 billion in December 2021. The Bank has met the SBP assigned mandatory targets under all SBP led initiatives including housing/construction finance and Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) Scheme. The Bank is also actively extending Islamic financing under export refinance, long term financing facility, financing for renewable energy, temporary economic refinance for plant and machinery, SME Asaan Finance etc.

During the half year ended June 30, 2022, the Bank made additional general provision of Rs 750 million against any potential non-performing financings and decline in borrowers' repayment capacity in view of the current ongoing economic slowdown. The Bank's non-performing financing ratio remained at an exemplary level of 1.7% versus overall banking industry average of 8%. The Bank maintains a comfortable level of provisions against its non-performing financings with a coverage ratio of 139% - one of the highest in the Banking industry. The Bank is fully geared up for adoption of IFRS - 9 and does not foresee any impact as a result of its implementation.

Deposits of the Bank grew by 8% closing at Rs 1.57 trillion as of June 30, 2022 from Rs 1.46 trillion last year. The Bank's deposit portfolio maintained an optimal deposit mix with current account deposits comprising 47% of its total deposits, amounting to Rs 747 billion. The current and savings account (CASA) deposits represent 83% of total deposits, amounting to Rs 1.3 trillion. Alhamdulillah, the Bank achieved landmark of one billion USD inflows through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) in a short span of less than two years. The Bank continued to maintain its leadership in RDA with market share of 24% in terms of total RDA remittances of the Pakistan Banking Industry.

# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

To cater the banking needs of diversified and geographically dispersed population of the country, and to further stretch its footprints, the Bank added new 96 branches to its network from June 2021, bringing the total network size to 931 branches in more than 300 cities. The Bank's ATM network also crossed the 1000 ATMs milestone during the half year which is a significant achievement for the Bank. In addition to the physical channels, the Bank continued to deepen its presence in the digital space. The Bank's acquiring business also increased to 4,900 POS machines deployed on merchants across Pakistan. The Bank's Mobile App remains the highest-rated mobile App in the banking industry on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed the entity ratings of the Bank at 'AAA/A-1+' (Triple A/ A-One Plus) which denotes highest credit quality, with negligible risk factors. Outlook on the assigned ratings is 'Stable'.

## Outlook

The Bank remains committed to contribute towards the economic growth and stability of the country by strengthening the Islamic Banking landscape, and assisting the Government to shift towards Shariah-compliant banking solutions in line with the SBP's strategic vision to increase the market share of IBI from its current level of 19% to 30% by 2025. The Bank aims to maintain its share of IBI deposits and plans to grow its deposit book in the mid-teens for the financial year 2022. The Bank plans to add InshaAllah more branches to its network which will expand its geographical presence across Pakistan and help provide shariah compliant banking solutions to the unbanked population of the country. At the same time, the Bank aims to continue its digital acceleration to ensure seamless digital experience to its customers.

The Board would like to express its sincere thanks and gratitude to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance for their continuous commitment to establish a viable Islamic financial system in the country. We would also like to thank our shareholders, Board members, Members of the Shariah Supervisory Board, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Sub-ordinated Sukuk (Tier II) and each one of our staff members for their hard work, commitment and support without which these results would not have been made possible. Most importantly, we are thankful to Allah Almighty for His blessings on our Bank which has enabled us to achieve this incredible performance in a very short span of time. We pray that He gives us more strength and wisdom to further expand our Vision of establishing Islamic banking as banking of first choice.

# ڈائریکٹرز کا تجزیہ

الحمد للہ رب العالمین

بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹرز مسرت کے ساتھ 30 جون، 2022 کو ختم ہونے والے نصف سال کے لیے بینک کے غیر آڈٹ شدہ مالیاتی بیانات اور انتظامی و مالیاتی جائزہ پیش کرتا ہے۔

## معیشت

30 جون، 2022 کو ختم ہونے والے مالی سال کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں معیشت کی شرح نمو 5.97 فیصد تک پہنچ گئی۔ عالمی وبا کے بعد معاشی سرگرمیوں میں بحالی کی وجہ سے مجموعی طلب میں اضافہ ہوا، جس کے نتیجے میں درآمدات میں نمایاں اضافہ ہوا۔ اس کے علاوہ، توانائی کی قیمتوں میں عالمی سطح پر اضافے کی وجہ سے مہنگائی کی شرح میں بھی 2022 کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں 29 فیصد تک کا اضافہ ریکارڈ کیا گیا۔

عام طور پر، پچھلے برس کے اسی عرصے کے مقابلے میں برآمدات میں 25 فیصد اضافہ ہوا ہے، جو کہ ایک مثبت رجحان ہے۔ اس کے برعکس، درآمدات میں بھی کافی حد تک اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ 2022 کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں مہنگائی کی شرح 15.2 فیصد (CPI) تھی جبکہ پاکستان کی مرکزی بینک (اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان) (SBP) نے شرح سود میں 11.3 فیصد تک کا اضافہ کیا۔ پاکستان کی معیشت کو مزید مستحکم کرنے اور افراط زر پر قابو پانے کے لیے ستمبر 2021 سے مالیاتی سیاست میں سختی کی گئی ہے۔ حکومت نے مالی پالیسی کو مزید سخت کرنے کے لیے مالی سال 2022-23 کے بجٹ میں بھی پیداواری شعبے پر ٹیکس میں اضافہ کیا ہے۔

## ہماری کارکردگی

الحمدللہ، ہمارے بینک نے مشکل معاشی حالات کے باوجود 2022 کے مالی سال کے پہلے نصف میں اچھی مالی کارکردگی کا مظاہرہ کیا ہے۔ 30 جون، 2022 کو ختم ہونے والے نصف سال کے لیے بینک کے بعد از ٹیکس منافع میں 36 فیصد کا اضافہ ہوا اور یہ 4.9 ارب روپے تک پہنچ گیا۔ 2022 کے پہلے نصف سال کے دوران بینک نے گزشتہ سال کی اسی مدت کے 12.6 ارب روپے کے مقابلے میں 17.1 ارب روپے کا منافع حاصل کیا۔ 2022 کے آخر تک بینک کے کل اثاثے 2021 کے 1,939 ارب (1,539 ارب روپے عام اور 400 ارب روپے اسلامی) سے بڑھ کر 2,049 ارب (1,610 ارب روپے عام اور 439 ارب روپے اسلامی) ہو گئے۔ 30 جون، 2022 تک بینک کی کل ڈپازٹس 57 فیصد بڑھ کر 1,749 ارب روپے ہو گئیں جبکہ گزشتہ سال کے اختتام پر یہ 1,795 ارب روپے تھیں۔ 2021 کے 39 فیصد کے مقابلے میں اس سال کے پہلے نصف میں ڈپازٹس کی شرح نمو 49 فیصد رہی۔ بینک کا کل سرمایہ 50 ارب (ADR) روپے سے زیادہ ہے جو کہ ایک اچھا اشارہ ہے۔ ہمارے بینک کا ADR 50 فیصد ہے جو کہ ایک مضبوط پوزیشن کی عکاسی کرتا ہے۔

بینک کا سرمایہ کفایت تناسب 16.27 فیصد ہے جو کہ 2021 کے 30 جون کے 7.75 فیصد کے مقابلے میں 10.52 فیصد زیادہ ہے۔ بینک ایک well-capitalized اور باثبات ادارہ ہے اور اس کا کیپیٹل ایڈیکویسی ریشو (CAR) 17.86 فیصد ہے جو کہ قانونی تقاضوں سے کہیں زیادہ ہے۔ آپ کو بتاتے ہوئے خوشی ہو رہی ہے کہ بورڈ نے دوسری سہ ماہی کے لیے 1.75 روپے (17.5 فیصد) منافع تقسیم کرنے کی منظوری دی ہے۔ پہلی سہ ماہی کے لیے بورڈ نے 10 فیصد منافع تقسیم کی منظوری دی تھی۔ اس نصف سال میں کل 3.50 روپے (35 فیصد) منافع تقسیم کیا گیا ہے۔ بینک 2022 کی پہلی سہ ماہی میں 1.75 روپے (17.5 فیصد) منافع تقسیم کر چکا ہے۔

[The text discusses various financial and operational aspects of a bank, likely a report or analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key points:]

حجم کے اس اضافے کا بنیادی محرک انفلیشن، ترسیلات میں اضافہ، بینکنگ اور مارکیٹ کے اثرات پر مبنی ڈیپازٹس کی گروتھ رہی۔ ڈیمانڈ ڈپازٹس کی کل ڈپازٹس میں شراکت 1.6 فیصد ہے جبکہ 3.1 روپے ہوئی۔ گروتھ جون 2021 سے ڈپازٹس کل 57 فیصد اضافہ اور 10.7 روپے پر پہنچ گئی۔

بینک کے پیڈ اپ کیپٹل اور ریزروز میں اضافہ 27 فیصد یا 16.7 روپے ہوا۔ 21.2 روپے ہوئی۔ جن 2021 کے بعد سے 96 فیصد اضافہ ہوا۔ اخراجات میں بھی اضافہ ہوا جو زیادہ تر افراط زر، توسیع کاروبار اور آئی ٹی کی بنیادی ڈھانچے میں سرمایہ کاری کے اقدامات شامل ہیں۔

تمام اخراجات میں سے زیادہ تر اضافہ پیپل کی لاگت میں آیا ہے۔ اس اضافے نے مالی سال کے دوران ریونیو کا 44 فیصد حصہ لیا۔ پچھلے سال کی نسبت میں 38 فیصد زیادہ ہوگیا۔

بینک کے ٹوٹل آپریٹنگ انکم 2021 کے 1.9 ارب روپے کے مقابلے میں 27 فیصد (516 ارب روپے) کے اضافے کے ساتھ 4.2 ارب روپے ہوگئی۔ حکومت پاکستان کے ساتھ معاہدے میں 600 ارب روپے سے زیادہ سرمایہ کاری کے بعد بینک کے پورٹ فولیو میں 620 ارب روپے کے اضافے کے ساتھ اس اضافے میں 1.2 ارب روپے کا حصہ شامل ہے۔ پاکستان کی جانب سے پاکستانی سٹاک کے لیے اسٹیٹ آف پاکستان کے ساتھ معاہدے کے تحت اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان کی جانب سے نئے کیپٹل مارکیٹ آپریشنز (CMO) کے ادارے اور انڈسٹریل بینک لمیٹڈ نے مشترکہ طور پر اسلامی بینکنگ صنعت (IBI) کو پروموٹ کرنے کے لیے پری-آئی پی او فنڈنگ کے لیے پاکستان حکومت اور اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان کے ساتھ معاہدے پر دستخط کیے ہیں۔

بینک کے کمیشن اور فیس پر مبنی آمدنی میں 53 فیصد کا اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ جس میں ٹریڈ، برانچ بینکنگ، ای-کامرس، موبائل اور انٹرنیٹ بینکنگ پر مبنی آمدنی شامل ہے۔ موسمی کاروبار کے تحت بینک کی کمیشن کی آمدنی میں Seasonal اتار چڑھاؤ، بینک کی مالی خدمات کی طلب میں اضافہ اور ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ کی گروتھ کی وجہ سے کمیشن کی آمدنی میں 827 ارب روپے کا اضافہ ہوا۔ دسمبر 2021 کے 777 ارب روپے سے بڑھ کر 5 فیصد اضافہ ہوا۔ بینک نے اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان کے ساتھ ملکر ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ کی ترقی کے لیے کئی اقدامات کیے ہیں۔ اس کے علاوہ، بینک نے پاکستان میں پہلی بار ای-کامرس کی سہولت فراہم کی ہے۔ بینک نے ملک کے پہلے قومی پیمنٹ گیٹ وے (NPMG) کو لانچ کیا ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ، بینک نے SME، کسان اور مائیکرو فنانس کے شعبوں میں سرگرمی سے کام کیا ہے۔

30 جون 2022 کو ختم ہونے والے نصف سال کے دوران بینک کے موجودہ پورٹ فولیو سے حاصل ہونے والے منافع اور ڈیویڈنڈ انکم حاصل کرنے والوں کی تعداد میں کمی آئی ہے۔ کوئی نئے پروجیکٹس کے لیے 750 ارب روپے مختص کیے گئے ہیں۔ بینک کی کل منافع آوری میں 8 فیصد کی شرح سے اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ بینک نے اپنی منافع آوری میں 1.7 فیصد کی شرح سے اضافہ کیا ہے۔ بینک کی پیڈ اپ کیپٹل میں 139 فیصد کا اضافہ ہوا ہے جو کہ صنعت میں سب سے زیادہ ہے۔ بینک نے IFRS-9 کو اختیار کرنے کے لیے پوری تیاری کی ہے۔ اس کے نتیجے میں کوئی بڑے اخراجات ہونے کا امکان نہیں ہے۔

بینک کے ٹوٹل فارن کرنسی ڈپازٹس میں سال کے 1.46 ارب روپے کے مقابلے میں 30 جون 2022 کو 1.57 ارب روپے کا اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ ڈپازٹ پورٹ فولیو میں ریٹیل ڈپازٹس کا حصہ 47 فیصد یعنی 747 ارب روپے ہے۔ کرنٹ اکاؤنٹ اور سیونگ اکاؤنٹس (CASA) کل ڈپازٹس کا 83 فیصد حصہ ہیں، جو 1.3 ارب روپے ہیں۔ اس کے علاوہ، بینک نے پاکستان میں پہلی بار ریگولیٹری اتھارٹی (RDA) اکاؤنٹ کے ذریعے ایک ارب روپے جمع کیے ہیں۔ پاکستان کے بینک نے اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان کی خدمت میں روشن ڈیجیٹل اکاؤنٹ کے ذریعے 24 فیصد حصہ کے ساتھ اپنی پوزیشن مضبوط کی ہے۔

ملک کی مجموعی اور مالیاتی استحکام کے لیے، ہونڈی کی آبادی کو بینکنگ کی ضروریات کی تکمیل کے لیے، اور اپنی موجودہ مارکیٹ شیئر میں اضافے کے لیے بینک نے جون 2021 کے بعد سے دیہی علاقوں میں 96 نئی برانچیں کھولی ہیں جس سے 300 سے زیادہ برانچوں میں بینک کی پہنچ 931 تک ہوگئی ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ بینک نے ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ کے ذریعے سال کے دوران 1000 کروڑ روپے کا کاروبار کیا ہے۔ جو کہ پچھلے سال کے مقابلے میں زیادہ ہے۔ بینک نے ڈیجیٹل زراعت میں اپنی پہلی قدم رکھا ہے۔ بینک کا ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ پلیٹ فارم پاکستان میں سب سے بڑا ہے جس میں 4,900 سے زیادہ ATMs اور CDMs ہیں۔ بینک کی موبائل ایپلیکیشن Apple App Store اور Google Play Store پر دستیاب ہے۔

صنعت میں سب سے زیادہ ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ کی سہولیات ہیں۔

VIS کریڈٹ ریٹنگ کمپنی آف پاکستان نے کہ AAAA/A-1+ (ڈبل اے اے اے پلس/اے ون پلس) ریٹنگ کی تصدیق جاری رکھنے کے بارے میں فیصلہ کر لیا ہے۔ سائٹ پر بیٹ کے مضبوط مالیاتی پروفائل کی عکاسی کرتی ہیں۔ یہ ریٹنگز مستحکم آؤٹ لک کی حامل ہیں۔

## مستقبل کے امکانات

بینک اسلامی پاکستان لمیٹڈ کی حکمت عملی اپنے کاروبار کو مستحکم کرنے، اپنی مارکیٹ پوزیشن کو مضبوط کرنے اور اپنے کسٹمر بیس کو بڑھانے کے لیے مسلسل جاری رکھنے کی ہے۔ ہماری کسٹمر بیس پاکستان کی اسلامی بینکنگ صنعت (IBI) کے 2025ء تک موجودہ 19 فیصد سے بڑھ کر 30 فیصد تک پہنچنے کے لیے مصروف عمل ہے۔ ہم اپنے کسٹمر اسلامی بینکنگ صنعت کی نمو میں اضافہ کرنے کا ارادہ رکھتے ہیں۔ مالی سال 2022ء کے لیے بینک نے اپنی ڈپازٹ بیس میں mid-teens تک اضافہ کی توقع کی ہے۔ بینک اللہ تعالیٰ کی مدد سے درک میں پرائم برانچوں کی تعداد میں اضافہ کرنے کی منصوبہ بندی کر رہا ہے۔

پاکستان میں اس کی موجودگی کو مزید مضبوط کرنے کے لیے، ہم نے حال ہی میں 6 نئے اسلامک بینکنگ ونڈوز کی منظوری دی ہے۔ اس کے ساتھ ساتھ بینک اپنے ڈیجیٹل بینکنگ پلیٹ فارم کو مضبوط کرنے کا ارادہ رکھتا ہے۔ یہ اسمارٹ بینکنگ کو مزید فروغ دے گا۔ اس کے ساتھ ساتھ کاروبار کے نئے ذرائع تلاش کرنے پر بھی توجہ دی جائے گی۔

پروڈنشل اسٹیٹ بینک آف پاکستان (SBP) اور وزارت خزانہ کے مطابق، پاکستان کی معیشت آف پاکستان میں قابل ملاحظہ اسلامی مالیاتی نظام کی مسلسل ترقیوں اور اصلاحات کے لیے تیار ہے۔ ہم پروڈنشل ریگولیٹری فریم ورک کے تحت درجہ بندی شدہ بینکوں (Tier I اور Tier II) کے لیے سرمایہ کی ضروریات اور معیارات کو پورا کرنے کے لیے تیار ہیں۔ جنہوں نے بینک کو ایران بنایا ہے۔ اسلامی بینکنگ کے لیے ایک مضبوط بنیاد کی تعمیر کے لیے ہم نے بہت محنت کی ہے۔ ہم سمجھتے ہیں کہ اللہ تعالیٰ کی مدد سے ہم مسلسل ترقی کے لیے تیار ہیں۔ ہم اپنے کاروباری حصول کے مقاصد کو پورا کرنے کے لیے پرعزم ہیں۔ ہم یقین رکھتے ہیں کہ اللہ تعالیٰ ہمیں اور ہماری ٹیم کو اسلامی بینکنگ کو پاکستان میں کامیاب بنانے کے لیے مدد فرمائے گا۔

اپنے خواب کو حقیقت میں بدلنے کے لیے ہم آپ سب کی دعاؤں کے طالب ہیں۔ آمین۔

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT
## TO THE MEMBERS OF MEEZAN BANK LIMITED

### Report on Review of Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

#### Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying unconsolidated condensed interim statement of financial position of Meezan Bank Limited ("the Bank") as at June 30, 2022 and the related unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income, unconsolidated condensed interim statement of changes in equity and unconsolidated condensed interim cash flow statement, and notes to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements for the half year then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

#### Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

#### Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

#### Other Matter

The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account and unconsolidated condensed interim statement of comprehensive income have not been subject to review and therefore, we do not express a conclusion thereon.

The financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021 and half year ended June 30, 2021 were audited and reviewed by another firm of Chartered Accountants who had expressed an unmodified opinion / conclusion on those statements vide their reports dated February 28, 2022 and August 25, 2021 respectively.

The engagement partner on the engagement resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Shahbaz Akbar.

### 21.3 Other contingencies

The Income Tax Department has amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2021. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against loans and advances, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East - Pakistan Branches have also been raised. The Bank has obtained stay order from the High Court of Sindh against the demands raised through the amended order for the tax year 2015. Both the Bank and the department have filed appeals with the Appellate Authorities in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in this financial statement with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East - Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of Islamic financing and related assets has been made in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy as stated in note 6.3.2 to the 2021 annual financial statements.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.

### 33.3 Fair value of non-financial assets

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims have been carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers (level 3 measurement) based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 14. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in this financial statements.
