With strong build up in core earnings, MCB's Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the half year ended June 30, 2022 increased to Rs 32.5 billion with a historic high PBT of Rs. 17.6 billion for the second quarter. Retrospective application of tax amendments along with higher tax rates for the current period enacted through Finance Act, 2022 resulted into 87% effective tax rate for second quarter. Profit After Tax (PAT) registered a decline of 25% to reach Rs. 11.13 billion against Rs. 14.74 billion reported in the corresponding period last year; translating into Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 9.39 compared to an EPS of Rs. 12.44.

On the back of strong volumetric growth in current account and favorable yield curve movements, net interest income for H1'22 increased by 24% over corresponding period last year. YoY average current deposits of the Bank registered a growth of Rs 86.30 billion (+17%) while the CASA deposits averaged at Rs. 1,366 billion; hence, the average CASA to total deposits ratio was measured at a level of 93% in H1'22.

Non-markup income registered a growth of 36% and aggregated to Rs. 12.90 billion against Rs. 9.50 billion in the corresponding period last year. The growth achieved is broad based and driven primarily by the prudent positioning of foreign exchange assets/liabilities amidst comparatively favorable swap curves and diversification of revenue streams through continuous enrichment of service suite while upholding highest service standards; foreign exchange, dividend income and fee & commission income rose by 195%, 28% and 12% respectively.

MCB strives to inculcate operational efficiencies across its entire spectrum through optimization, automation and streamlining of business processes. This relentless focus has enabled the Bank to prudently manage its operating expense base despite sustained inflationary pressures due to currency devaluation and rising commodity prices, higher compliance related regulatory charges, expansion in branch outreach and regular performance and merit adjustments of the Human Capital.

For H1'22, the operating expenses of the Bank were recorded at Rs. 19.44 billion, growing by a modest 13% year on year, while the cost to income ratio significantly improved to 38% from 42% reported in corresponding period last year. Proactive monitoring and recovery efforts led to a net provision reversal against non-performing loans (NPL's) which aggregated to Rs. 1,696 million for the period under review.

Persistent focus on maintaining a robust risk management framework encompassing structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk. The Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 51.19 billion. The Bank has not taken FSV benefit in calculation of specific provision against its non-performing loans (NPL's) base. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 86.78% and 7.87% respectively.

On the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank grew by 3% and was reported at Rs. 2,039 billion. Gross advances registered an increase, of Rs. 15 billion (+2%), as the consumer lending book further consolidated its traction gained in the last year and grew by Rs. 5.4 billion (+14%).

During the period under review, MCB's strategic objective of achieving growth in no-cost current account base was reinforced by an uncertain and volatile interest rate scenario; leading to persistent re-pricing gaps between the earning assets and liabilities. Hence, the Bank registered a growth of 21% in non-remunerative deposits to close the period at Rs. 681.46 billion. CASA mix was reported at an industry leading level of 92.41% which in turn is a reflection of the customer loyalty earned by the Bank through sustained provision of quality services over a rich heritage of 75 years. The total deposits of the Bank grew by 13%, as compared to an industry growth of 9%.

During the ongoing year, the Bank celebrates successful completion of 75 years of its banking services to the nation. Originating from modest beginnings, the Bank has transformed into a dynamic and innovative organization; overcoming a multitude of challenges along the way with resolve and fortitude. Recognition by the globally coveted Asia Money awards as 'Pakistan's Best Corporate Bank of the Year' in 2022 is a testament to its legacy of posting consistent and exceptional performance for its stakeholders.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is 16.45% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank's Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 15.43% against the requirement of 6%. Bank's capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 5.86% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 214.25% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 131.53% against requirement of 100%.

The Board of Directors has declared a 2nd interim cash dividend of Rs. 4.0 per share i.e 40%, in addition to 50% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the half year ended June 30, 2022 to 90%.

# Economy Review

During the first half of calendar year (CY) 2022, Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions worsened on the back of rising international commodity prices and untargeted energy subsidies. Uncertain political situation caused overall economic confidence to fall sharply during March and April. Unsustainable fiscal measures taken especially during March – May 2022 caused import bill to further expand, resulting in higher monthly current account deficits. As a result, country's foreign exchange reserves fell to critical levels. However, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) presented a contractionary budget for the fiscal year 2023 to improve economic stability of the country.

Annual inflation in Pakistan reached a fourteen-year high level of 21.3% in June 2022 from 13.8% in May 2022. The monthly inflation was recorded as 6.3%. The average annual inflation for fiscal year 2022 (FY22) has reached 12.2%, above SBP's initial forecast of 11%. The sharp increase in the rate of price hikes was observed mainly due to consistently rising international commodity prices, PKR devaluation against USD, and reversal of fuel and electricity subsidies.




On the external front, Pakistan's trade deficit expanded by 55.3% in a year from USD 31.1 billion in FY21 to USD 48.3 billion in FY22. Import bill continued to increase as an outcome the GOP imposed ban on almost 800 import items in June 2022. The current account deficit (CAD) for the FY22 reached USD 17.41 billion. Higher current account deficits and external debt repayments caused country's foreign exchange reserves to fall from USD 17.7 billion in January 2022 to USD 9.8 billion in June 2022. Pakistan received a commercial loan of USD 2.3 billion from China in June to support falling foreign exchange reserves. PKR depreciated almost by 16% during the first six months of CY 2022; from 176.5135 on December 31, 2021 to 204.8467 on June 30, 2022. Subsequent to half year end, PKR touched its lowest of 239.9427 on July 28, 2022 before improvement to 213.8992 on August 16, 2022.

The State Bank of Pakistan raised policy rate cumulatively by 400 bps in the second quarter of 2022 from 9.75% to 13.75% and further 125 bps increase on July 07, 2022 taking the benchmark rate to 15.0%. SBP noted the need to cool down economic activities as the growth in economy had been much stronger than expected to keep inflation expectations anchored and contain risks to external stability. Real GDP growth rate for FY22 is estimated at 5.97%.

On the fiscal side, the FBR collected net tax revenue of PKR 6,125 billion in FY22 against an upwardly revised target of PKR 6,100 billion. On yearly basis, FBR revenue collection presented a growth of 29.1% from PKR 4,744 billion in FY21. In May 2022 and June 2022, the GOP removed fuel and energy subsidies to meet the IMF conditions for the seventh and eighth reviews of Extended Fund Facility (EFF). This has caused a sharp increase in the domestic headline inflation.

## Chunk 5

# Future Outlook

The budget of FY23 is comparatively contractionary. This coupled with rising policy rate is expected to moderate domestic demand and economic activity in Pakistan. On the back of international interest rate hikes, the global demand is expected to fall in the coming months, which may impact domestic GDP growth as well. The staff-level agreement reached between IMF and Pakistan on the combined seventh and eight reviews for EFF, amounting to USD 1.9 billion, bodes well for the country's dwindling foreign reserves and shall pave the way for financing from other multilateral and bilateral sources. Under these measures, the balance of payment issues are expected to be resolved and PKR depreciation against USD is expected to moderate. Inflation in the economy will likely remain elevated throughout the fiscal year 2023. SBP expects the GDP growth rate for FY23 to be in between 3% to 4%.

## Chunk 8

# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

## Chunk 9

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor's review report is Hammad Ali Ahmad.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'held to maturity'. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available financial statements.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

---

## Chunk 57

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34 or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives, shall prevail.

---

## Chunk 78

# 3.2

The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS-7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" on banks through S.R.O 411(1) /2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through various circulars.

---

## Chunk 79

# 3.3

The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated July 10, 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014. However, vide its notification SRO 56 (I)/2016 dated January 28, 2016, it has been notified that the requirements of IFRS 10 and section 228 of the Companies Act, 2017 will not be applicable with respect to the investment in mutual funds established under trust structure.

---

## Chunk 80

# 3.4

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 05 of 2019 dated March 22, 2019 and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the audited annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.

---

## Chunk 81

# 3.5

Amendments to approved accounting standards that are effective in the current period There are certain amendments to existing accounting standards that have become applicable to the Group for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. These are considered either to not be relevant or not to have any significant impact on the Group's consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

---

## Chunk 82

# 3.6

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective The following new standard and amendments to existing accounting standards will be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standard or amendment:

| Amended Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8                                       | January 1, 2023 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – Amendment to IAS 12 | January 1, 2023 |
| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1                          | January 1, 2024 |

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

As per the SBP's BPRD Circular Letter no. 03 dated July 5, 2022, the applicability of IFRS 9 to banks in Pakistan has been deferred to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Therefore, these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime to the extent of the Group's domestic operations, whereas the requirements of this standard are incorporated for overseas jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 on Bank's financial statements is being assessed with respect to domestic operations.

21.1 Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not been taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Group, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

21.2 Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Group essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non-financial assets, the Group has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
