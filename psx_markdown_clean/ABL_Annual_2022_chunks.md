# CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

Global economy has faced multifaceted challenges and headwinds during 2022. Unprecedented surge in commodity prices, counter-inflationary measures adopted by major economies, geo-political unrest, lingering pandemic effects in China’s economic slowdown and disruption in supply chain continued to weigh on the world’s economic activities. Managing a balance between subdued economic activity and containing inflationary pressures pose a significant concern for global policy makers.

Amidst the macroeconomic uncertainty, digital advancements and technological developments accelerated during pandemic continued to evolve the global banking landscape. Development of digital financial solutions and strengthening of core data infrastructure for storing, computing and safeguarding big data have proven to be most vital for digitalization of the economies. Developed and advanced countries are moving towards cashless economies as a result of enhanced focus on digitalization of financial systems.

Digital disruption in financial sector is driven by technological advancements and ever evolving expectations of consumers. On the technological front, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Application Programming Interface (API), Cloud Computing and Distributed Ledger Technology are major drivers of innovation. At the same time, speed, immediacy and convenience have become preferences for consumers while choosing among the financial service providers.

Advanced Analytics using AI, Machine Learning and Internet of Things (IoT) have opened new horizons for banks to continuously research about customer preferences and create personalized financial services. Banking is being transformed from brick-and-mortar model (physical branches) to digital space offering solutions based on sophisticated technology. Conventional bankers are being replaced by highly specialized tech savvy human capital. Banks are leveraging new-age technologies to offer a contextual banking experience and a personal-assistant-like service in which customers are offered relevant products at the right place and time.

API, Open Banking and Banking-As-A-Service (BaaS) have allowed Fin-Techs to develop their own financial service products. These technologies have reshaped banking institutions into platforms and allowed expansion of distribution avenues, create new service products, reduce costs, diversify revenue streams and gather greater consumer insights.

Embracing technological transformation has inherent cybersecurity risks and threats to digital infrastructure, services, and data, which rely on increasingly connected systems. Fostering secure financial system with digital inclusiveness is of paramount importance. Significant investments are being carried out in cloud infrastructures and sustainable supercomputing capabilities to expand adoption of artificial intelligence and strengthening of cybersecurity.

To foster the data driven decision making culture, Your Bank implemented ‘Data Lake’ for structured and unstructured data by leveraging Big Data technologies. Data Science companies have been engaged for implementing multiple use cases through Machine Learning models, and in turn, improve and personalize the customers’ experience.

To accelerate application deployment lifecycle and shift workloads across multiple frameworks and simultaneously counter emerging risks, Your Bank implemented Cisco ACI, the industry’s most secure, open and comprehensive.




CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solution for data center networks. It facilitates automation, accelerates infrastructure deployment and improves governance. This makes cash management efficient and lowers the cost by reducing physical cash replenishment frequency.

In line with the Banks’ long term strategic vision and to apply consistent customer centered approach; Your Bank launched Digital Lending platform “Smart Advance” that enables customers to avail instant loans within few clicks. The Bank added another self-service smart branch to the network at University of Management & Technology (UMT), Lahore, implemented Digital Onboarding of Resident Individual Customers through web portal and replaced paper-based Life Certificate of Pensioners with biometric verification.

These initiatives provided essential impetus to Your Bank to increase the mix of digital transactions to counter transactions which stood at 74:26 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 65:35 for the corresponding year. To further augment the e-banking and digital eco system, Your Bank enhanced the features of WhatsApp Banking service which is now being used by over 670,000 accountholders, introduced QR codes in place of conventional accounts number for money transfer through myABL and implemented Positive Pay functionality at myABL to replace Call Back Confirmation for pre-authorization of high value cheques.

Your Bank, maintained its industry pioneer status in introducing many innovative financial solutions. The Bank has launched Pakistan’s first virtual touchpoint in metaverse by leveraging the technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Blockchain. Your Bank’s metaverse touchpoint allows its customers to:

- Open an account through the myPDA portal;
- Conduct transactions through myABL portal;
- Contact a customer representative for any query; and
- Provide feedback and learn about various new products and services.

The Bank is pioneer in the industry to launch self-service branches which offer full-scale, rapid, secure and hassle-free banking services ensuring superior customer experience. Self-service branches have revamped the dynamics of conventional brick and mortar branches having manual processes towards automated digital banking space through Smart/Hybrid Branches and Digital Lobbies.

Allied Bank has developed an Innovation Lab equipped with latest gadgets and acts as a research hub for Digital Banking Advisory Services, Tree Plantation campaigns, installation of solar panels, workflow automation system and end to end automation to promote paper less culture.

Your Bank as a socially responsible citizen reinforces its commitment towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which is a core part the Bank’s vision. Creating an inclusive work environment encompassing gender diversity and multi-cultural workforce, application of renewable energy sources, serving community during adversities and reducing carbon foot print including environmental risks.

# Global Economic Outlook

Global economic outlook remains depressed due to geopolitical unrest, higher inflation and post pandemic slowdown in China. IMF has downgraded the world’s GDP growth to 3.1% in 2024 from previous projection of 3.2%. Global inflation is, however, expected to fall from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 as a result of subdued global demand and cooling effects of monetary policy tightening measures taken by most central banks in the World.

On the domestic front, IMF has projected GDP growth at 4.4% in 2024 from 2.0% in 2023. However, fiscal slippages, depleting forex reserves, external account risks, effect of floods and political uncertainty will continue to slow down domestic economic progress.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to extend my gratitude to the regulatory bodies including State Bank of Pakistan, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and Federal Board of Revenue for their continuous guidance and support. I would also like to appreciate our valued shareholders for having confidence in the Bank’s long-term strategic goals.

Finally, I would like to pay my gratitude to Allied Bank’s management team and over 11,000 Allied Bankers, for their strenuous efforts and contributions in building a robust and technology-driven Allied Bank.

CEO’S REVIEW

In year 2022, global economic growth remained subdued, mainly as a result of persistently rising inflation, slow down in China and Russia-Ukraine conflict. Monetary tightening measures in most of the economies in the world for cooling off consumers’ demand and to curb inflation further toned down the economic activity.

Factoring in these macroeconomic challenges, International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded Global growth estimate from 6.2% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022 and further anticipates the growth declining to 2.9% in 2023. However, growth is projected to rise to 3.1% in 2024 from recent reopening of Chinese market making way for faster than expected recovery.

Pakistan’s economy is under constant pressure from trickledown impact of global economic contraction. Uncertain political environment, rapidly rising commodity prices, supply side disruptions and humanitarian crisis from recent floods have compounded the macroeconomic imbalances.

Despite aforementioned global shocks and domestic challenges, country remained on a path of steady economic growth with GDP increasing by 6% for the second consecutive year in FY 2022. This was achieved on account of 4.4% growth in Agriculture, 7.2% growth in the Industrial sector and 6.2% growth in the Services sector. However, due to unresolved underlying structural challenges and macroeconomic imbalances, this high growth may not be sustainable. Accordingly, IMF and World Bank estimated GDP growth to slow down to 2% in FY 2023 with recovery in FY 2024 to 4.4% as per IMF and 3.2% as per World Bank. GDP revival in FY 2024 is based on anticipated lower global inflation, post flood rehabilitation activities and increase in agriculture output.

Agriculture sector grew by 4.4% in FY 2022 as compared to 3.5% in FY 2021, mainly driven by high yields, attractive output prices, better availability of certified seeds, pesticides and agricultural credit. During Jul-Dec FY 2023, the agriculture credit disbursement was recorded at Rs. 842.4 billion, higher by 31.5% from Rs. 640.8 billion compared to corresponding period last year.

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) has witnessed contraction of 3.6% during Jul-Nov FY 2022-23 and by 5.5% on YoY basis in November 2022 mainly attributable to effects of slow-down in demand, increasing inflation and tightening of monetary policies by the central bank. In addition to global issues, demand compression polices to reduce inflation and imbalances at domestic level also contributed towards decline in LSM. Despite aforementioned effects, 5 out of 22 manufacturing sub sectors (Wearing apparels, Leather products, Electrical equipment, Furniture and other manufacturing) have shown positive growth during the period under review.

Global slowdown has contracted the demand resulting in reduction of exports by 5% during Jul-Dec FY 2022-23 as compared to corresponding period last year and dropped to US$ 17,737 million from US$ 18,674 million. On the other hand, imports restrictions by the Government mainly in non-energy related machinery and transport categories resulted in significant decline in imports by 19.9% in Jul-Dec FY 2022-23. Imports have reduced to US$ 33,393 million during Jul-Dec FY 2022-23, from US$ 41,666 million during the corresponding period last year. Higher decline in imports as compared to exports resulted in improvement in balance of trade which provided respite in the Current Account Deficit (CAD). Resultantly, Current Account Deficit, reduced to US$ 3,667 million for Jul-Dec FY 2022-23 as against US$ 9,091 million deficit during corresponding period last year.

Impact of decline in Current Account Deficit also resulted in improvement in the balance of payment which recorded a surplus of US$ 4,284 million during Jul-Dec FY 2022-23, improved considerably from the deficit of US$ 788 million during Jul-Dec FY 2021-22.

Gross Foreign Exchange (FX) Reserves reduced to US$ 10,845 million as on December 31, 2022 as compared to US$ 23,883 million as on December 31, 2021. Depletion in foreign exchange reserves is mainly attributable to debt repayments and lower inflows in financial account. During the period Jul-Dec FY 2022-23, workers’ remittances were recorded at US$ 14,051 million as compared to US$ 15,808 million during comparative period last year showing a decline of 11.1%. This is mainly attributable to revival of air travel, global economic slowdown and gap in open market and inter-bank rates.

Net collection of Federal Board of Revenue was reported at Rs. 3,732 billion, demonstrating a notable growth of 16.9% during Jul-Dec FY 2022-23 as compared to Rs. 3,191 billion in the corresponding period last year. However, fiscal deficit stood at Rs. 1,683 billion during Jul-Dec FY 2022-23 as compared to Rs. 1,372 billion in corresponding period last year mainly attributable to increase in total expenditure significantly by 19.8% to Rs. 6,382 billion during Jul-Nov FY 2022-23 against Rs. 5,328 billion in the same period last year.

CEO’S REVIEW

Asset base of Your Bank reached Rs. 2,250,973 million as on December 31, 2022, exhibiting moderate increase of 12% as against 26% increase during comparative period last year.

Your Bank continued to maintain solid asset quality through application of Robust Risk Management framework and quality obligor assessment. Resultantly, the Bank maintained its industry position of having one of the lowest infection ratios and the highest coverage ratios of 1.53% and 90.4% respectively. Non-performing loans (NPLs) were reduced by 4% and were recorded at Rs. 13,104 million as on December 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 13,601 million as on December 31, 2021.

Your Bank’s gross loan portfolio registered a significant growth of 29% and was recorded at Rs. 857,488 million as on December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 665,740 million last year. Likewise, net advances augmented by 30% to record at Rs. 845,640 million as on December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 652,890 million as at December 31, 2021.

Prudent investment was made in floating rate Pakistan Investment Bonds and Market Treasury Bills to counter the pressures emanating from gradual policy rate hike during 2022. As a consequence, Net Investments increased by 6% to reach at Rs. 1,123,117 million as on December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 1,064,495 million during the last year. The growth is primarily driven by deployment of funds in risk free government securities.

The Bank continued its journey towards enhancing customer satisfaction by delivering value-added financial services through process simplification, automation and digitization resulting in building New to Bank (NTB) relationships along with deepening of existing relations. Consequently, Your Bank achieved robust growth of 22% in customer accounts as on December 31, 2022 as against 16% growth during the last year. Total number of accounts crossed 6 million mark with 1.3 million plus new accounts opened during the year ended December 31, 2022 depicting historic growth of 29% in new accounts opened as compared to corresponding year.

Your Bank’s deposit base reached Rs. 1,522,297 million as on December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 1,413,295 million as at December 31, 2021; reflecting a growth of 8% which is higher than industry growth of 7%. Growth in no-cost and low-cost deposit remained key strategic objective of Your Bank, which depicted a strong growth of 21% on average volume basis. However, on outstanding volume basis, current deposits show a growth of 1% to close at Rs. 608,969 million as on December 31, 2022; reducing their mix in total deposit to 40% in 2022, as compared to 43% in 2021. Moreover, saving deposits reflected a growth of 4% to close at Rs. 335,399 million as on December 31, 2022; reducing their mix in total deposit to 22% in 2022, from 23% in 2021.

Continuous increase in interest rates during the year 2022, led the average policy rate to increase by 590bps to 13.18% against 7.28% in the last year. Consequently, Mark-up income witnessed healthy increase of 82% mainly attributable to higher yields on investments, advances and bank placements, to reach at Rs. 215,469 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 118,649 million for the corresponding year.

Likewise, significant increase of 104% was witnessed in interest expense to close at Rs. 148,750 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 73,062 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is mainly attributable to higher cost of deposits (including swap cost). Consequently, Net Interest Income (NII) increased by 46% to reach Rs. 66,719 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 45,587 million during corresponding year.

Your Bank maintained high quality service standards for digital banking through utilizing artificial intelligence tools resulting in robust growth of 20% in Fee based Income which stood at Rs. 8,147 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 6,811 million in the last year.

Your Bank’s dividend income increased by a healthy 44% to stand at Rs. 3,088 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as against Rs. 2,151 million during last year.

Higher trade volumes on the back of significant increase in POL, volatility in spot and swaps and wider spreads allowed Your Bank to record a significant growth in foreign exchange income which reached at Rs. 7,948 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Your Bank remained successful in enriching its service offerings in both conventional and digital banking, maintaining existing customer revenue portfolio and exploring new income avenues. As a result, Your Bank earned non-markup income of Rs. 20,675 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to Rs. 15,938 million during corresponding year; exhibiting an appreciable growth of 30%.

# Future Outlook

Amid global measures by central banks to contain inflation, Russia-Ukraine conflict and economic slowdown in China, IMF estimates decline in global GDP growth from 3.4% to 2.9% in 2023. However, growth is expected to rise to 3.1% in 2024 based on anticipated economic revival in China from covid restrictions, steady.



Recovery from Russia-Ukraine Conflict

and subsiding inflation for food and oil commodities.

Going forward, weaker global demand and monetary policy tightening by central banks is expected to reduce global inflation from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024.

Pakistan’s economic challenges mainly stem from political uncertainty, damages by floods, inflation spikes, currency depreciation and deterioration of fiscal and external position. Fiscal and institutional reforms and resolution of power sector critical issues are recommended by IMF. Resultantly, IMF and World Bank projected real GDP growth to decelerate to 2% in FY 2023, with later on recovery to 3.2% (World Bank) in FY 2024 based on easing in global inflationary pressures, recovery in agriculture production and infrastructure rebuilding.

As per World Bank, growth in agriculture sector is projected to decline sharply for the first time in decades due to flood related damages and will also have spillover effects on the manufacturing and services sectors. Accordingly, growth in these sectors is estimated to decline significantly to 2.3% and 3.2% respectively in FY 2023 as compared to 7.2% and 6.2% respectively in FY 2022.

For FY 2023, IMF projects 20% hike in inflation whereas the same is projected at 23% by World Bank. This elevation is mainly attributable to higher energy prices, floods related disruptions and rupee devaluation. Going forward, the inflation will moderate to 9.5% (World Bank) and 6.5% (IMF) for 2024 and 2026 respectively.

As per World Bank, growth in imports is projected to decline to 2.3% in FY 2023 from 15.6% in FY 2022, mainly attributable to import containing measures to reduce current account deficit. Considering slower economic activity and continuation of import restrictive measures, World Bank anticipates current account deficit to narrow down to 4.3% of GDP in FY 2023. Growth in exports, on the other hand, is also expected to reduce significantly to 1.5% in FY 2023 from 8.4% in FY 2022.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased policy rate to 17% in January 2023 to anchor inflationary pressure and cooling off consumers’ demand. As a result of containment measures, SBP anticipates average inflation to be within the range of 21%-23% during FY 2023.

Your Bank is very enthusiastic about improving its products and services in order to strengthen the whole digital perspective and meet the expectations of our customers. Various innovative products and services are lined up, which will be implemented with an agile methodology. Contactless payments including NFC & QR, Enterprise Loyalty, Acquiring Business, Self Service Branches are in pipeline with a vision of Enhancing Customer Experience & Engagement, Promote Process Automation & Business Intelligence and Digital Transformation.

Recognizing the challenges for economy of Pakistan, Your Bank shall continue to take pragmatic measures to ensure effective risk management of the Bank’s assets through investments in technology and human resource development.

For 2023, Your Bank aims to continue its focus on major initiatives such as effective utilization of the implemented Modules of Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications (OFSAA) and Operational Risk Management Module of Risk Nucleus, process design assessments and control testing, automation of workflows in Risk Assessment and Management System, information security awareness campaigns, augmentation of the Bank maintained warehouses for pledge financing.

Being cognizant of disruption through digital banking, Your Bank has plan to enhance the scope of existing digital lending platform from consumers to Small Enterprises, Medium Enterprises and commercial businesses by innovating credit scoring models and processes for credit risk assessment, disbursement and monitoring.

Collaboration with leading FinTech and Data Analytic companies will be evaluated to leverage the developments taken place with regards to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.

Your Bank strives to provide a full spectrum of Shariah-compliant products and services in the competitive Islamic banking sector, maintaining operational effectiveness and top-notch client care, allowing the Bank to achieve significant growth.

Customer awareness workshops would continue to be a priority and promotion of Islamic banking in Pakistan as a means of increasing the country’s financial inclusion would be given substantial weight. Additionally, automation and digitization would continue to play a major role in the expansion and development of Islamic banking.

Going forward, Your Bank would carry on the initiative of installing Electronic

# Macro-Economic Developments

Year 2022 started with less vulnerability related to pandemic related uncertainty. However, global economy remained fragile due to a number of turbulent challenges. Slowdown in China, Russia Ukraine conflict and ongoing supply chain disruptions kept hampering the economic activity. Persistent inflationary pressure depleted the purchasing power especially for lower earnings segment. Tightened monetary and fiscal measures adopted by central banks in most of the economies to cope with inflation and moderate the consumer demand showed positive results and inflation is expected to provide respite gradually.

Global economic growth expectations estimated by International Monetary Fund (IMF) remained subdued at 3.4% for 2022 as compared to 6.2% growth in 2021. Slowdown in global economic activity has toned down overall demand which is having its spillover effects on the manufacturing industry of Pakistan. Furthermore, the damages incurred by floods have also dampened growth prospects. The production of Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) witnessed a decline of 3.6% during Jul-Nov FY2023 as compared to growth of 7.2% in the comparative period last year. Out of 22 sub-sectors, only 5 sectors exhibited positive growth, which include wearing apparel, leather products, electrical equipment, furniture and other manufacturing sectors.

The improvement in trade balance had also eased out as Current Account Deficit (CAD) reduced to US$ 3,667 million during Jul-Dec FY2023 from US$ 9,091 million during corresponding period last year. Exports of goods and services was recorded at US$ 17,737 million during Jul-Dec FY2023 as compared to US$ 18,674 million for Jul-Dec FY2022; registering a decline of 5.0%. Imports of goods and services reached at US$ 33,393 million during Jul-Dec FY2023 as compared to US$ 41,666 million during the same period last year showing a decline of 11.1%. Remittances were recorded at US$ 14,051 million during Jul-Dec FY2023 as compared to US$ 15,808 million in same period last year.


32 Annual Report 2022




Heavy debt repayments and significantly lower inflows in the financial account have led to significant decline in Foreign Exchange Reserves. Total liquid Foreign Exchange Reserves stood at US$ 10,845 million as on December 31, 2022 as compared to US$ 23,883 million as of December 31, 2021.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reached at US$ 460.9 million during Jul-Dec FY2023 as against US$ 1,114.7 million last year; depicting a decrease of 58.7%. Power sector added 51.4% of the total FDI whereas, financial business and Oil & Gas explorations added 38.2% and 19.3% respectively.

Fiscal accounts are under pressure to rebuild buffers in order to curb inflation, strengthening the economic recovery and supporting the vulnerable conditions arisen due to Russia-Ukraine conflict and additional spending on post flood relief activities.

Net collections of Federal Board of Revenue increased by 16.9% to reach at Rs. 3,732 billion during Jul-Dec FY2023 against Rs. 3,191 billion in comparable period of last year. During Jul-Dec FY2023, total expenditure increased by 19.8% and recorded at Rs. 6,382 billion as against Rs. 5,328 billion during the same period last year. Overall, fiscal deficit stood at Rs. 1,683 billion during Jul-Dec FY2023 as compared to Rs. 1,372 billion last year.

During the month of December, the CPI clocked in at 24.5% on a year on year (YoY) basis as compared to 12.3% in December last year. This significant increase is attributable to exchange rate depreciation along with rapid increase in fuel and commodity prices. Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) index registered 40,420 points as on December 30, 2022 as compared to 44,596 points as on December 31, 2021; declining by 10%.

In view of this challenging situation, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) adopted tightening of monetary policy to moderate demand, prevent the compounding of inflationary pressures and to safeguard the external account stability and has progressively inflated policy rate by 725 basis points since December 2021 to bring it at 16% in November 2022 and 17% in January 2023.

Global growth is expected to remain under pressure due to higher inflation, Russia-Ukraine conflict and economic slowdown in China. However, reduced demand and policy measures adopted to contain inflation are expected to give positive results gradually. Accordingly, IMF has forecasted global growth would accelerate slightly to 3.1% in 2024 as compared to 2.9% in 2023 and global inflation would fall from 6.6% in 2023 to 4.3% in 2024.

At domestic front, IMF has projected GDP to grow by 2.0% in FY2023 and 4.4% in FY2024, whereas, SBP has projected the domestic growth around 2.0% in FY2023. SBP forecasts inflation to remain elevated within the range of 21-23% in FY2023 and current account deficit to be around 3.0% of GDP.

# Political

Uncertain political environment continued to be major factor affecting the economic activities of the country. A range of fiscal and monetary
policy measures were implemented to address the macroeconomic imbalances and mitigate external account risks, which are listed
below.

- Change in regime, persistent risks of default, delay in carry through of International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and currency
volatility remained the highlights during 2022.
- Year 2022 faced multiyear high inflation thus forced SBP to tighten policy stance, resultantly benchmark rate was increased from
9.75% in January 2022 to 16% in November 2022.
- Multiple relief measures were implemented for the flood-affected agriculture sector like mark-up subsidies for farmers and provisions
of subsidized inputs.
- To restrict looming current account deficit (CAD), several duties along with restrictions on import of non-essential items were imposed
to restrain the outflow of foreign currency while providing stimuli towards encouraging the export sector and local manufacturers.

- International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated the global growth at 3.4% in 2022. Geo-political tension, persistent high inflation,
economic slowdown in China and Russia-Ukraine conflict have pared the global economic growth. IMF projects the world’s GDP
growth at 2.9% in 2023.
- IMF has estimated real GDP Growth of Pakistan at 6.0% for 2022 which was earlier estimated at 4.0% as compared to 5.7% in 2021.

as compared to US$ 9,091 million in same period last year.
- Outlook: The economic outlook deteriorated significantly due to macro imbalances and political disturbances along with external
factors. Average inflation is expected to remain in the range of 21 - 23% owing mainly to higher food prices.

# Geopolitical Environment Affecting the Banking Industry

Pakistan is located at a region which has great political, economic and strategic importance. Pakistan has the potential to develop transit economy due to its strategic location by offering direct and shorter trade routes to China, Central Asian States and Afghanistan with Middle East, Africa and Europe. However, the economic potential is still largely untapped mainly due to unstable security situation and conditions in Afghanistan, trade restrictions on Iran and due to political tensions between Pakistan and its eastern neighbor India. Improvement in the security condition in Afghanistan, lifting or easing of trade restrictions on Iran, and progress in relations with India has the potential to increase the trade volumes and to bring the mutual economic benefits resulting into establishing formal banking channels and offering related banking services.

The economic problems of Pakistan were further aggravated due to its inclusion in the grey list of Financial Action Task Force in 2018. This resulted in widespread reforms in the financial sector including the implementation of Anti Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Countering Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/CPF) guidelines by updating the policies and procedures of the Banks in line with the regulations issued by the State Bank of Pakistan. The removal of Pakistan from the grey list of FATF in 2022 is expected to bring financial ease in securing much needed economic aid from the global financial institutions.

## Chunk 136

# COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AND MARKET POSITIONING

The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, evolving customer expectations and prevailing economic conditions. The Bank expects that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense and shall impact on the Bank’s future business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products such as payments processing. Furthermore, payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as blockchain which may be subject to lower levels of regulatory oversight. Shifting customers trends towards digital channels have caused data breaches become prevalent and made privacy concerns intense, thus regulatory and compliance requirements are becoming more restrictive as a result. Furthermore, introduction of Digital Banks by the regulator could potentially have significant impacts on the banking system and the role of commercial banks within it by disrupting the current provision of banking products and services. It could allow new competitors, some previously hindered by banking regulations (such as FinTechs), to provide customers with access to banking facilities and decrease the intermediation role of banks. Further to aforesaid, customer demands are evolving as they seek round-the-clock personalized services.

The Bank having an appropriate mix of brick-and-mortar model of branches along with robust digital infrastructure base, is positioned in right place to meet the diverse requirements of its existing customers and to attract the new customers. Furthermore, the Bank’s operational support base including staff is fully equipped with appropriate skills mix, competence and infrastructure to address the challenges posed by changes in regulatory regime, technological advances, evolving customer expectations and behaviors.

# Sensitivity Analysis

The Pak Rupee witnessed high volatility during the year and, on year-on-year basis, depreciated by around 28.28% against US Dollar in Inter Bank Exchange Market.

Foreign Exchange Risk exposes the Bank to changes in the value of exposure denominated in foreign currencies due to the exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. The types of the instruments exposed to this risk are mainly investments in foreign branches, advances and deposits denominated in foreign currency, cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, etc.

The Bank monitors different limits like Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit (FEEL), Currency-Wise Limits, NOSTRO Limits and intra-day Net Open Position for effective risk management. The Bank also conducts stress testing of the foreign exchange, equity and fixed income portfolio which is reviewed by the Bank’s senior management and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC).

The Bank’s Foreign Exchange Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Bank utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the bank’s personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank’s corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions.

| The increase is mainly attributable to higher Foreign exchange income, higher fee income and higher Dividend income, partially offset by lower Capital Gain on disposal of investments and lower Other income. Increase in Foreign exchange income is mainly attributable to higher trade volumes, volatility in spot and swaps and wider spreads, during the year. Fee income increased mainly on account of higher Card related fee, Branch banking customer fee, Cash management fee, Trade fee and Investment banking fee, partially offset by lower Commission on remittances.  |                         |      |      |      |      |      |   |   |   |   |   |

TREASURY

The year 2022 started with inflation taking the center stage in the global economic corridors. The overhang of highly accommodative economic policies especially the unprecedented monetary easing and fiscal largess coupled with fault lines in the global supply chain, which had started to trouble the global policy makers towards the end of 2021, morphed fully into multi decade high inflationary forces.

The persistent inflation forced the global central banks to reassess their ‘transitory’ mantra and acted swiftly in the form of nearly 300 interest rate hikes as trillions of dollars were wiped off the global equities, bonds and relatively nascent digital assets. The traditional safe havens provided no shelter as US treasuries and German Bonds lost 17% and 25% on a total return basis as US Fed and ECB delivered 400 bps and 250 bps of rate hikes respectively.

This proved to be one of worst years for emerging and developing economies as their risk assets and currencies surrendered to the USD, many losing more than half of their value reminding many of the 1996 Asian currency crisis. Pakistan economy was among the most affected ones as foreign exchange reserves dwindled towards record lows and inflation rose to multiyear high. Global rating agencies downgraded the Country and premium on credit default swaps surged to record levels. International banking counterparts slashed their country risk exposures which further aggravated the liquidity crunch.

During these turbulent times, ABL Treasury continued to play a significant role in preserving and enhancing the stakeholders’ value during the challenging year. The Bank timely anticipated policy shifts and refrained from adding to the portfolio duration while enhancing the return as SBP hiked rates by 625 bps during the year. This was achieved by gradually adding floating rate bonds to the portfolio. On the FX side, the Bank played its role, in close coordination with all internal and external stakeholders, and ensured that the markets continue to function during an exceptionally volatile year.

Additionally, the Bank achieved a historic milestone of surpassing the deposit of Rs. 1,500 billion in year ended December 31, 2022 complemented by Current Account Deposit mix of 40%. Moreover, 7.7% growth in total deposit was witnessed in outstanding deposits enabling 19% average deposit growth.

The Bank continued to expand its physical footprint; resulting in the overall branch network to reach at 1,453 including 117 Islamic branches and 135 exclusive Islamic windows to support business expansion in new demographics. Remaining focused on boarding New to Bank relationships, the Bank added 1.3 Million plus accounts to the existing account base during the year.

In line with the objectives of National Financial Inclusion strategy of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Bank continued to play a pivotal role. Unique segment specific offerings like Allied Youth Account, Allied Senior Citizen Account, Allied Khanum Account and Allied Asaan Account continued to contribute towards financial inclusion of relatively un-banked, low-

Furthermore, in line with digital on boarding framework of SBP; customers can open account through website / mobile app without visiting the branch. The Bank remained amongst the industry leaders to facilitate customers and to support the economy by increasing the inflow of foreign remittances. In this regard, RDA campaign was launched which resulted in a significant growth in inflow of foreign remittances and customer base.

The Bank has continued its support to SMEs in these financially vulnerable times by extending financing facilities and has exhibited growth in this segment. The Bank was also selected as participating bank in SBP SME ASAAN finance scheme for collateral free lending up to Rs. 10 Million under which the Bank disbursed credit facilities on clean basis. Moreover, the Bank has contributed towards government initiatives like Prime Minister’s Youth Business and Agriculture Loan Scheme.

On consumer finance front, Allied Bank Limited offered Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) under Government’s Markup Subsidy Scheme for Housing Finance at lower and affordable subsidized markup rate in line with SBP and GOP’s initiative. Under this scheme, middle and low-income segments of the society were facilitated with housing finance facility.

Further, Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar Mela was organized by SBP which was held in Faisalabad on 19th and 20th March 2022. All leading Banks, Builders and Developers participated in this event. The Bank exhibited a stellar performance which was duly acknowledged by the visitors and appraised by SBP. ABL’s Team assisted applicants in filling up application forms, issued In-Principle Approvals (IPAs) and processed the applications up to final approval level including issuance of Facility Offer Letters.

On conclusion of the event, ABL achieved first position and was declared winner on issuing ‘Highest Number of IPAs’, Runner Up for setting up an impressive and ‘Innovative Stall’ and 3rd Position on ‘Number of Logins’ by logging in large number of applications. In addition, ABL Team processed 5 approvals during the event.

On digital front, the Bank ventured for another initiative of Innovation Challenge Fund-5 “Small Distributor Financing” and has developed data driven lending model using Digital Platform. The Bank enhanced the scope of a digital variant of personal loan “Allied Payday Finance” by adding more corporates and institutions and their employees maintaining salary accounts with the Bank; thus, providing an instant access to financing round the clock.

| 1      | Provision against non-performing advances | The Bank’s credit portfolio is spread across various domestic branches including one foreign branch and mainly includes corporate financing to several public sector entities and large to small size businesses operating in the private sector. As per the Bank’s accounting policy (refer note 2.4.1 to the unconsolidated financial statements), the Bank determines provisions against non-performing advances in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision as required by PRs. The PRs require specific provisioning against advances on the basis of an age-based criteria which is supplemented by a subjective evaluation by the Bank of its portfolio of advances. The determination of subjective provision against advances involves use of management judgment, on a case-to-case basis, considering factors such as the borrower’s economic, financial and business conditions, repayment behaviors and credit worthiness. The Bank’s advances to the customers represent 38% of its total assets as at 31 December 2022 with carrying value of Rs. 845,640 million which is net of provision of Rs. 11,848 million at the year end. In view of the magnitude of advances in the unconsolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified provision against advances as a key audit matter. The accounting policy and disclosures relating to provisioning against non-performing advances are included in note 4.5 and 9 respectively to the unconsolidated financial statements. |

We applied a range of audit procedures including the following: We reviewed the Bank’s process for identification and classification of non-performing advances, monitoring of advances with higher risk of default and migration of these advances to non-performing advances category and accurate computation and recording of provisions. We performed independent checks on test basis for the computations of provisions to assess that the same is in line with the requirements of the applicable Prudential Regulations. In addition, we selected a representative sample of borrowers from the portfolio of advances including individually significant credit facilities and performed tests and procedures such as review of credit documentation, repayment history and past due status and financial condition as depicted by the borrowers’ financial statements. In respect of the level of general provision maintained by the Bank, we discussed the approach and policy followed by the Bank with the management. We also assessed adequacy of disclosures as included in note 9 to the unconsolidated financial statements regarding the non-performing advances and provisions made for the same in the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# 2 Valuation of listed shares classified as available for sale

As disclosed in note 8 and the accounting policies in notes 2.4.2 and 4.12 to the unconsolidated financial statements, the Bank has a significant investment in listed shares/equity investments classified as available for sales amounting to Rs. 17,167 million which is stated net of provision of Rs. 1,646 million as at 31 December 2022.

These investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy relating to their measurement. Provision for investment in listed shares classified as available for sale is made based on the impairment policy of the Bank which comprises of subjective factors.

Because of its significance to the unconsolidated financial statements and the use of management judgment in determination of impairment against listed shares classified as available for sale, we have considered this as a key audit matter.

Our procedures in respect of valuation of investments, amongst others, included the following:

- Obtaining an understanding of and testing the design and operational effectiveness of the controls relating to the valuation of available for sale equity investments including an assessment of the methodology and the appropriateness of the valuation models and inputs used to value investments available for sale.
- Checking on a sample basis, the valuation of investment in listed shares to supporting documents and externally quoted market prices.
- Comparing the cost of each equity investment to its market value to determine decline in valuation and checked that the impact of significant or prolonged decline was recognized as per the policy of the Bank as disclosed in note 4.12.
- Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to listed shares classified as available for sale to assess compliance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the unconsolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 379

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

# Report on the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. The financial results of the Islamic banking branches have been consolidated in these financial statements for reporting purposes, after eliminating inter-branch transactions and balances. Key financial figures of the Islamic banking branches are disclosed in Annexure II to these financial statements.

# STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS OF AND AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLISHED APPROVED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN THE CURRENT YEAR

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for following amendments to accounting standards which are effective for current year. The Bank has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective:

- IFRS 3 Business Combinations - The amendment updates a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 Business Combinations to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately. The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. The amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date. In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Bank applies the amendments prospectively, i.e., to business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application). These amendments had no impact on the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.
- IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – Amendment to clarify the prohibition on an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss. In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Bank applies the amendments retrospectively only to items of PP&E made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment (the date of initial application). These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank as they are not involved in manufacturing business.
- IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Amendments to specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs to include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract management and supervision). General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. The Bank applied the amendments to the contracts for which it had not fulfilled all of its obligations at the beginning of the reporting period. These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank, as prior to the application of the amendments, the Bank had not identified any contracts as being onerous and the unavoidable costs under the contracts, which were the costs of fulfilling them, comprised of incremental costs directly related to the contracts and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. Accordingly, the adoption of the above amendments to accounting standards did not have any material effect on the unconsolidated financial statements.

In addition to the above amendments to standards, improvements to various accounting standards (under the annual improvements 2018 - 2020 cycle) have also been issued by the IASB in May 2020. Such improvements were generally effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022:

- IFRS 16 Leases: Lease incentives – The amendment removes the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements in Illustrative Example 13 acBanking IFRS 16. This removes potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives when applying IFRS 16 and had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank.
- IAS 41 Agriculture: Taxation in fair value measurements – The amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 that entities exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of IAS 41.

# 2.3 STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS OF AND AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLISHED APPROVED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE

| – IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.

In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:                                                                                                                                                         | January 01, 2024                                      |

# – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction -

Amendments to IAS 12 - In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 12, which narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

The amendments should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

# – IFRS 16 Leases - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback -

Amendments requires a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease. A seller-lessee applies the amendments retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application.

## Chunk 401

# – IFRS 10 & IAS 28 - Consolidated Financial Statements & Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – (Amendment).

The effective date of Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 has been deferred indefinitely (until the research project of IASB on the equity method has been concluded). Earlier application of the September 2014 amendments continues to be permitted. The Bank expects that the adoption of the amendments will have no material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.

Further, the following new standards have been issued by the IASB, which are yet to be notified by the SECP for the purpose of applicability in Pakistan:

| Standard                             | Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after) |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| IFRS 1 - First time Adoption of IFRS | January 01, 2024                                      |
| IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts        | January 01, 2023                                      |

The Bank expects that the adoption of the above standards will have no material effect on the Bank’s financial statements, in the period of initial application.

The SBP vide BPRD Circular no. 02 dated February 09, 2023 has specified the new reporting format for the financial statements of Banking companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements and will become applicable for the financial statements of the Bank for the year ending December 31, 2023.

# 2.4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Estimates, underlying assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in application of accounting policies are as follows:

## Chunk 403

# 2.4.1 Provision against non-performing loans and advances

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess amount of non-performing loans and advances and provision required there-against. While assessing this requirement various factors including the delinquency in the account, financial position of the borrower and the requirements of the Prudential Regulations are considered. The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the requirements set out in Prudential Regulations.

# 2.4.2 Valuation and impairment of ‘available-for-sale’ equity investments

The Bank determines that ‘available-for-sale’ equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. This determination of what is significant and prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there is evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flows.

# 2.4.3 Defined benefit plans

Liability is determined on the basis of actuarial advice using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the liability and related expense are disclosed in note 35.

## Chunk 405

# 2.4.4 Classification of investments

- In classifying investments as ‘held-for-trading’ the Bank has determined securities which are acquired with the intention to trade by taking advantage of short term market or interest rate movements and are to be sold within 90 days.
- In classifying investments as ‘held-to-maturity’ the Bank follows the guidance provided in SBP circulars on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity.
- The investments, other than those in subsidiary, which are not classified as ‘held-for-trading’ or ‘held-to-maturity’ are classified as ‘available-for-sale’.

## Chunk 406

# 2.4.5 Depreciation, amortization and revaluation of operating fixed assets

In making estimates of the depreciation and amortization, the management uses method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Bank and estimates the useful life. The method applied and useful lives estimated are reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern or timing of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the estimate would be changed to reflect the change in pattern. Such a change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard 8 - Accounting Policies, ‘Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. Further, the bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on the valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

## Chunk 407

# 2.4.6 Fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities

The fair value of the assets and liabilities is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bank categorizes fair value measurements within the following fair value hierarchy:

- a) Level 1: These are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bank can access at the measurement date.
- b) Level 2: These are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- c) Level 3: These are input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable Inputs).

## Chunk 408

# 2.4.7 Lease term

The Bank applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 409

# 2.4.8 Income taxes

In making estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Bank, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. There are certain matters where the Bank’s view differs with the view taken by the income tax authorities and such amounts are shown as a contingent liability.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank except for note 4.1 mentioned below which will be applicable from January 01, 2023. Significant accounting policies are enumerated as follows:

## Chunk 412

# 4.1 Change in accounting policy effective from January 01, 2023

IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ As directed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at 31 December 2021. SBP finalized and issued the IFRS 9 Application Instructions vide same circular, for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

During the year 2022, the management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 taking into account the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. However, the Bank expects an increase in the loss allowance resulting in a negative impact on equity. In addition, the Bank will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

---

## Chunk 413

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of debt financial assets will depend on how these are managed (the entity’s business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). The classification of equity instruments is generally measured as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) unless the Bank elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) at initial recognition. The Bank has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

---

## Chunk 414

# Equity Securities

The Bank expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. For certain equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. For those equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will, instead, be measured at fair value through profit or loss, which will increase volatility in recorded profit or loss for future periods. The revaluation surplus / deficit related to those securities in amount, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified to retained earnings however, there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification. Unquoted equity securities are required to be measure at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has postponed this requirement for banks till one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

---

## Chunk 415

# Debt securities, Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those passing the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell these investments. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those passing the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Cashflows of certain debt instruments classified in AFS and / or HTM categories, do not expect to give risk to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest and accordingly, these would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments),
lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance
(or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events
that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance
(or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument
(‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have
experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of
impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should
incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions
and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should
take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment
taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SICR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at
Default.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are
exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and stage 2
provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision
computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

# Hedge accounting

IFRS 9 aligns hedge accounting more closely with risk management activities and establishes a more principle-based approach
to hedge accounting.

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature
and extent of Bank’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting
from 1 January 2023, which includes the presentation and disclosures under IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

## Chunk 418

# Additional requirements and exceptions introduced by SBP Instructions

State Bank of Pakistan has enforced the application of IFRS 9 in its entirety except for some exceptions and additional requirements.
A high-level comparison of such exceptions that are relevant to the Bank is as follows:

- Scope of application

Financial statements of overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates prepared for the purpose of consolidation at
the bank level should be based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices till one year from the
effective date of IFRS 9 implementation (i.e. 1 January 2023). Afterwards, banks will be required to comply with the
requirements of these application instructions for consolidated financial statements. These instructions will not apply
on the standalone statutory financial statements of banks’ associates, subsidiaries and overseas branches that shall be
prepared according to their rules and regulations applicable to them.
- Unquoted equity securities

SBP has advised banks to measure investment in unquoted equity securities at lower of cost or breakup value till
December 31, 2023. In case where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost
and the breakup value will be classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the Profit and Loss account.
- Rebuttable presumptions

IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes
that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the
backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage
allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose
more stringent days past due criteria.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

- Transfer out of Stage 3
An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially. For the purpose of reversal of provisions, the PRs requirements will be followed for Stage 3 assets.
- Income recognition on impaired assets
The Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e. OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.
- Expected Credit Loss Model (ECL)
Credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, a two-track approach is required i.e. Stage 1 and stage 2 provision to be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3’s provision to be made higher of IFRS 9 ECL or PR’s requirement.
- Impact of Provisions on Regulatory Capital
The banks are allowed to include provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

# Loan / financing related fee

Loan origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the lender for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related loan. However, if the commitment expires without the lender making the loan, the fee would be recognised as revenue as earned.

## Chunk 421

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

---

## Chunk 422

# Classification and measurement

Based on the bank’s assessment, the IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have the following impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets and financial liabilities:

1. Debt instruments (amount of Rs. 22.451 million has been reclassified from AFS to FVTPL);
2. Equity instrument (amount of Rs. 17,546.986 million has been reclassified from AFS to FVOCI).

## Chunk 423

# Impairment

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank’s equity at January 01, 2023 is decrease in equity of approximately Rs. 937.16 million, representing corresponding impact of:

- A decrease of approximately Rs. 1,644.141 million related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of approximately Rs. 706.981 million related to deferred tax.

---

## Chunk 424

# Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 will result in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which is likely to reduce their lending capacity and ability to support their obligors. In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the FIs to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the ‘Application Instructions’ issued by SBP have detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement must apply only to provisions for stage 1 and 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital. Where there is a reduction in CET1 capital due to new provisions, net of tax effect, upon adoption of an ECL accounting model, the decline in CET1 capital (the “transitional adjustment amount”) must be partially included (i.e. added back) to CET1 capital over the “transition period” of five years.

# 4.6 Fixed assets and depreciation

# a. Tangible assets

Property and equipment owned by the Bank, other than land and building, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses if any, and is not depreciated while buildings are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method, except buildings which are depreciated using the reducing balance method, to write down the cost of property and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The rates at which the fixed assets are depreciated are disclosed in note 10.2. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if required. Adjustments in residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are treated as change in accounting estimates.

Depreciation on additions is charged from the month the assets are available for use, while no depreciation is charged in the month in which the assets are disposed off.

When an asset or class of assets is revalued, any increase in the carrying amount arising on revaluation is recorded through other comprehensive income and credited to the revaluation reserve in equity. However, the increase shall be recognized in the Profit and Loss Account to the extent it reverses previously recognised revaluation decrease/impairment loss of the same asset in the Profit and Loss Account, net of amortization or depreciation had no revaluation.

decrease/impairment been required for the asset in prior years. A decrease resulting from a revaluation is initially charged directly against any related revaluation surplus held in respect of that asset and the remaining portion being charged as an expense.

The surplus on revaluation of fixed assets to the extent of incremental depreciation (net of deferred tax) charged on the related assets is transferred directly to un-appropriated profit.

Revaluation of entire class of assets is carried out by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity (every third year) to ensure that the carrying amount of the entire class of assets does not differ materially from their fair value.

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the asset is derecognized, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Profit and Loss Account.

---

## Chunk 434

# b. Intangible assets

Intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The cost of intangible assets is amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method.

## Chunk 435

# 4.7 Lease liability and right of use asset

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Banks’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognised upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

The Bank has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the Profit or Loss Account on a straight-line basis.

# 4.8 Taxation

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

The Bank also recognizes a deferred tax asset or liability on deficit or surplus on revaluation of fixed assets, non-banking assets and investments which is adjusted against the related deficit or surplus in accordance with the requirements of IAS-12 ‘Income Taxes’.

# 22 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Bank at present does not offer structured derivative products such as Interest Rate Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements or FX Options. However, the Bank buys and sells derivative instruments such as:

- Forward Exchange Contracts
- Foreign Exchange Swaps
- Equity Futures
- Forward Contracts for Government Securities

## Chunk 515

# Forward Exchange Contracts

Forward Exchange Contract (FEC) is a product which is offered to the obligor who transact internationally. These obligor use this product to hedge themselves from unfavorable movements in a foreign currency, however, by agreeing to fix the exchange rate, they do not benefit from favorable movements in that currency.

An FEC is a contract between the Obligor and the Bank in which both agree to exchange an amount of one currency for another currency at an agreed forward exchange rate for settlement over more than two business days after the FEC is entered into (the day on which settlement occurs is called the value date). FEC is entered with those Obligors whose credit worthiness has already been assessed, and they have underlined trade transactions.

If the relevant exchange rate moves unfavorably, Obligor will benefit from that movement because the Bank must exchange currencies at the FEC rate. In order to mitigate this risk of adverse exchange rate movement, the Bank hedges its exposure by taking opposite forward position in inter-bank FX.

---

## Chunk 516

# Foreign Exchange Swaps

A Foreign Exchange Swap (FX Swap) is used by the Bank if it has a need to exchange one currency for another currency on one day and then re-exchange those currencies at a later date. Exchange rates and forward margins are determined in the “inter-bank” market and fluctuate according to supply and demand.

An FX Swap prevents the Bank from gaining any benefit resulting from a favorable exchange rate movement in the relevant currency pair between the time Bank enters into the transaction deal and when settlement occurs. Cancellation of the swap may also result in exposure to market movements. The key advantage of an FX swap is that it provides the Bank with protection against unfavorable currency movements between the time it enters into the transaction and settlement. The term and amounts for FX Swap can also be tailored to suit the Bank’s particular needs.

## Chunk 517

# Equity Futures

Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022

The Bank may use equity futures as a hedging instrument to hedge its equity portfolio, in both ‘held-for-trading’ and ‘available-for-sale’, against equity price risk. Only selected shares are allowed to be traded on futures exchange. Equity futures give flexibility to the Bank either to take delivery on the future settlement date or to settle it by adjusting the notional value of the contract based on the current market rates. Maximum exposure limit to the equity futures is 10% of Tier I Capital of the Bank, based on prevailing SBP regulations. The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives are given in Note 4.17.2. The risk management framework of derivative instruments is given in note 42.

# Expected contributions to be paid to the funds in the next financial year

The Bank contributes to the gratuity fund as per actuarial expected charge for the next financial year. No contributions are being made to pension fund due to surplus of fair value of plan’s assets over present value of defined obligation. Based on actuarial advice, management estimates that the charge or (reversal) in respect of defined benefit plans for the year ending December 31, 2023 would be as follows:

|                                                | Pension fund | Gratuity fund | Post retirement medical | Employees’ compensated absences |

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized within the statement of financial position.

# 35.16 Funding Policy

The Bank endeavors to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date having regards to the various actuarial assumptions such as projected future salary increase, expected future contributions to the fund, projected increase in liability associated with future service and the projected investment income of the Fund.

## Chunk 560

# 35.17 Risk associated with defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans may expose the bank to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

Longevity risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Investment risks: The risk arises when the actual performance level of investment levels is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the final benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectations and impact the liability accordingly.

Withdrawal Rate: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 38 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 38.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as “held to maturity”. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 4.5 to these unconsolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 568

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

## Chunk 584

# Categories of Risk

Credit Risk This risk is defined as the possibility of loss due to unexpected default or a deterioration of credit worthiness of a business partner. Credit Risk includes Country Risk i.e., the risks that counterparty is unable to meet its foreign currency obligations as a result of adverse economic conditions or actions taken by governments in the relevant country.

Market Risk The risk that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Bank will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and / or commodity prices, resulting in a loss to earnings and capital.

Liquidity Risk The risk that the Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

Operational Risk Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. The definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic risk and reputational risk.

Reputational Risk The Reputational risk arises from the negative perception on the part of stakeholders that can adversely affect a bank’s ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding.

Information Security & Governance Risk Information Security and Governance Risk Management involves the identification of an organization’s information assets and the development, documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information.

Strategic Risk Risk of an adverse impact on strategic goals. Strategic risk mainly arises from strategic decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, or lack of responsiveness of Bank to industry, economic or technological changes.

Shariah Non-Compliance Risk Shariah Non Compliance Risk arises from the failure to comply with shariah rules and principles determined by the Shariah Board of the Bank and the Regulator.

# Risk Management Group Organization

The Risk Management Group is headed by a Group Chief responsible for set-up and implementation of the Risk Management Strategy of the Bank.

Risk management functions have been segregated by business specialization, i.e., Credit Risk, Credit Administration, Technical Appraisal, Information Security and Enterprise Risk which interalia includes Policy and Procedures, Risk Architecture, Operational Risk and Market & Liquidity Risk. All these functions are operating in tandem to monitor the health of assets and liabilities, while ensuring risk mitigants against cyber and information system threats.

## Chunk 587

# 42.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk, the potential default of one or more debtors, is a major source of risk for the Bank. The Bank is exposed to credit risk through its lending and investment activities. The Bank’s credit risk function is divided into Corporate and Financial Institutions Risk and Commercial, SME and Consumer Risk. The functions operate within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes. The credit risk management activities are governed by the Credit Policy of the Bank that defines the respective roles and responsibilities, the credit risk management principles and the Bank’s credit risk strategy. The policy is supported by a comprehensive Credit Procedures Manual.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk:

- i) Sovereign credit risk on its public sector advances
- ii) Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances
- iii) Counterparty credit risk on interbank limits

---

## Chunk 588

# Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it prefers obtaining a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the Government of Pakistan (GOP). However, certain public sector enterprises have a well defined cash flow stream and appropriate business model, based on which the lending is secured through collaterals other than GOP guarantee.

---

## Chunk 589

# Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances

Each borrower’s credit worthiness is analyzed on the Credit Application Package that incorporates a formalized and structured approach for credit analysis and directs the focus of evaluation towards a balanced assessment of credit risk with identification of proper mitigants. These risks include Industry Risk, Business Risk, Financial Risk, Security Risk and Account Performance Risk. Financial analysis is further strengthened through use of separate financial spread sheet templates that have been designed for manufacturing / trading concerns, financial institutions and insurance companies.

---

## Chunk 590

# Counter Party Credit Risk on Interbank Limits

In the normal course of its business, the Bank’s Treasury utilizes products such as Reverse Repo and Call Lending to meet the needs of interbank borrowers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in market, interest and currency rates. Further, these products are also used to temporarily invest Bank’s liquidity prior to disbursement.

All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty in the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Reflecting a preference for minimizing exposure to counterparty credit risk, the Bank maintains eligibility criteria that link the exposure limits to counterparty credit ratings by external rating agencies.

# A. Country Risk

The Bank has in place a Country Risk Management Framework which has been approved by the Board. This framework focuses on providing detailed roles and responsibilities with respect to country risk assessment as well as limit setting, exposure management and reporting of cross border exposure undertaken by the Bank. The Bank utilizes S&P, Fitch and Moody’s country ratings as well as other macroeconomic and external risk factors in assigning a country risk limit. The Financial Institutions Division is responsible for monitoring of country exposure limits.

# 42.2 Market Risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and market conditions. Thus market risk can be further described into Interest Rate Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk and Equity Position Risk.

Market Risk performs risk measurement, monitoring and control functions through the use of various risk procedures and models. To give it a formal structure, all the policies and guidelines are approved by the Board of Directors and the relevant management committees.

The Bank uses three types of risk management tools to measure the Bank’s Market Risk: Value-at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Stress Testing. In addition, control limits are utilized to maintain the risks within acceptable levels.

The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover all interest rate risks falling under the “Trading Book” as well as “Banking Book”, as defined by Basel capital accord. The Bank uses Standardized Approach in determining market risk exposures in the capital adequacy calculation. Maturity method is used to calculate charge on Interest rate risk and FX risk.

In its pursuit of automation, the Bank has successfully implemented Oracle Financial Services Analytical Application (OFSAA) Market Risk Module to automate the risk monitoring and reporting activities pertaining to Market Risk, which allows for more efficient risk monitoring and increased focus on risk analysis to help in making more informed decisions.

# 42.2.3 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates.

The majority of the Bank’s net foreign currency exposure is in US$ and the Bank uses system-based monitoring of its intra-day Net Open Position for effective risk management.

The Bank’s FX Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Bank utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

# 42.2.4 Equity position Risk

Equity Price Risk is risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in stock prices (single stocks, or a basket of stocks, or overall stock market). ABL holds a diversified portfolio of equity investments in order to minimize non-systematic risk while retaining acceptable systematic risk. ALCO ensures that equity price risk is mitigated through prudent portfolio management.

The Bank maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against equity price risk. Equity investments classified as “Held-for-Trading” as well as listed non-strategic equity investments classified as “Available-for-Sale” are part of the “Trading Book” and are subject to market risk change as specified by the Basel Framework. Un-listed and listed strategic equity investment are part of the “Banking Book” and are subject to credit risk charge as specified by the Basel Framework.

# 42.2.5 Yield and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)-Basel II Specific

Interest rate and Rate of return risk is the current or prospective risk of losses, to both the Bank’s capital and earnings, arising from movements in interest rates and rates of return. The Bank has a robust system in place to monitor Interest rate risk and ALCO regularly analyses the interest rate scenario and devises strategies to minimize adverse impact of interest rate risk on the Bank’s equity and profits.

Interest rate risk is measured through “duration” of an instrument. To assess the interest rate risk at Balance Sheet and Income Statement level, gap analysis on “re-pricing schedule” is utilized. Re-pricing schedule is a distribution of interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet positions into a number of predefined time bands according to their maturity (if fixed-rate) or time remaining to their next re-pricing (if floating-rate), and is calculated in compliance with SBP instructions. For non-contractual assets and liabilities, an ALCO approved methodology is utilized to place these assets and liabilities in the re-pricing schedule. This methodology is based on the results of a behavioural analysis which statistically models the historical trends of the last 5 years.

Government securities (PIBs & T-Bills, Sukuks), Bonds, Debentures, etc. and other money market investments are subject to interest rate / rate of return risk. To capture the risk associated with these securities, extensive modeling is being done with respect to duration analysis. Stress testing and scenario-based models are also in place to capture the sensitivity of the portfolio to adverse movement in interest rates. For prudent risk management, all money market investments are marked to market to assess changes in the market value of investments due to interest rate movements. Yield/ Interest rate sensitivity position for on-balance sheet instruments is based on the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity date and for off-balance sheet instruments is based on settlement date.

In accordance with BSD Circular No.03 of 2011, issued by the SBP, Bank is required to report interest rate sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities on the basis of an objective and systematic behavioural study which is approved by ALCO.

# 42.3 Operational Risk

The Bank, like all financial institutions, is exposed to different types of operational risks, including the potential losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information, communication, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and the execution of legal, fiduciary and agency responsibilities.

In accordance with the BoD approved Operational Risk Management Policy (ORM), Bank maintains a system of internal controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in view of the bank’s financial strength and the characteristics of the activities and market in which it operates. These internal controls are periodically updated to conform to industry best practices.

The Bank has implemented workflow based system “Risk Nucleus” for Operational Risk Loss Data Collection & Reporting, Risk Control & Self Assessment (RCSA) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) monitoring. Further, major Operational Risk events are also analyzed from the control breaches perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness.

Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are presented to senior management and Board’s Risk Management Committee & BoD.

The Bank has a BoD approved BCP policy and Business Continuity Plan applicable to all its functional areas. The Bank updates functional BCPs on annual basis or at any process change.

The Bank is also implementing internationally accepted Integrated Framework on Internal Control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), with a view to consolidate and enhance the existing internal control processes.

The Bank with permission of SBP is conducting a parallel run for Alternate Standardized Approach (ASA) for Basel II – Operational Risk Capital Charge Reporting, which signifies efforts of the Bank for advance approach.

Outbreak of COVID 19 and continuous resurgence of the pandemic waves due to mutation of the virus has been a cause of concern for the banking industry and required continuous monitoring and transformation in the existing way of doing business.

The operating procedures of the Bank were transformed and business continuity plan were updated in line with the guidelines issued by the Government, Health Care and Regulatory Authorities, in a timely manner to minimize the impact of disruption on business activities and on service delivery to the customers without compromise to the safety of all the stakeholders including customers and employees in particular.

# 42.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Bank is unable to fund its current obligations and operations in the most cost efficient manner. The Bank’s Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility to Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) for ensuring that Bank’s policy for liquidity management is adhered to on a continual basis. ALCO uses gap analysis based on “maturity schedule” to assess the Bank’s liquidity risk and devise strategy accordingly. The Bank has various limits and triggers in place to monitor liquidity risk on a periodic basis, while it also utilizes stress testing to assess adequacy of Bank’s liquid assets. The Bank complies with State Bank of Pakistan’s instructions on Liquidity Standards as prescribed under the Basel III Framework.

Liquidity Management Framework

Daily liquidity management is carried out centrally by the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Desk in Treasury Group which manages the day to day liquidity needs of the Bank. Funding and liquidity management strategies are regularly discussed during Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings. The discussions include analysis on composition of deposits and tenure, funding gaps and concentration, monitoring of short and long-term liquidity ratios (including Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio). The Bank utilizes internal Management Action Triggers and Limits which act as early warning indicators and safeguards to ensure sufficient liquidity buffers at all times. Additionally, stress tests are performed to evaluate available liquidity under a range of adverse scenarios and to identify potential vulnerabilities in portfolios. The Bank also has in place contingency funding plan that identifies specific management actions that can be invoked in times of liquidity crisis.

Liquidity Risk Management

The Bank has in place a robust Recovery Plan in place to deal with any liquidity crisis in the most efficient and effective manner. SBP initiatives such as deferral of principal and rescheduling and restructuring of loans may have an adverse effect on liquidity and maturity profile of the Bank, however the Bank holds sufficient liquidity buffer to absorb any unforeseen shocks during the prevailing situation. Moreover, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Bank continues to regularly monitor the liquidity position of the Bank in view of emerging risks.

| 1      | Provision against non-performing advances | The Group’s credit portfolio is spread across various domestic branches including one foreign branch and mainly includes corporate financing to several public sector entities and large to small size businesses operating in the private sector. As per the Group’s accounting policy (refer note 2.4.2 to the consolidated financial statements), the Group determines provisions against non-performing advances in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations (PRs) of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and also maintains general provision as required by PRs. The PRs require specific provisioning against advances on the basis of an age-based criteria which is supplemented by a subjective evaluation by the Group of its portfolio of advances. The determination of subjective provision against advances involves use of management judgment, on a case-to-case basis, considering factors such as the borrower’s economic, financial and business conditions, repayment behaviors and credit worthiness. The Group’s advances to the customers represent 37% of its total assets as at 31 December 2022 with carrying value of Rs. 844,219 million which is net of provision of Rs. 11,848 million at the year end. In view of the magnitude of advances in the consolidated financial statements and the level of involvement of management’s judgment, we identified provision against advances as a key audit matter. The accounting policy and disclosures relating to provisioning against non-performing advances are included in note 4.5 and 9 respectively to the consolidated financial statements. |

As disclosed in note 8 and the accounting policies in notes 2.4.2 and 4.12 to the financial statements, the Group has a significant investment in listed shares/equity investments classified as available for sales amounting to Rs. 17,167 million which is stated net of provision of Rs. 1,646 million as at 31 December 2022.

These investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy relating to their measurement. Provision for investment in listed shares classified as available for sale is made based on the impairment policy of the Group which comprises of subjective factors.

Because of its significance to the consolidated financial statements and the use of management judgment in determination of impairment against listed shares classified as available for sale, we have considered this as a key audit matter.

Our procedures in respect of valuation of investments, amongst others, included the following:

- Obtaining an understanding of and testing the design and operational effectiveness of the controls relating to the valuation of available for sale equity investments including an assessment of the methodology and the appropriateness of the valuation models and inputs used to value investments available for sale.
- Checking on a sample basis, the valuation of investment in listed shares to supporting documents and externally quoted market prices.
- Comparing the cost of each equity investments to its market value to determine decline in valuation and checked the impact of significant or prolonged decline was recognized as per the policy of the Group as disclosed in note 4.12.
- Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to listed shares classified as available for sale to assess compliance with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.

# Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group’s Annual Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

## Chunk 676

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Chunk 702

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

- IFRS 3 Business Combinations - The amendment updates a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 Business Combinations to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately. The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. The amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date. In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Bank applies the amendments prospectively, i.e., to business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application). These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
- IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – Amendment to clarify the prohibition on an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss.
- In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Bank applies the amendments retrospectively only to items of PP&E made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment (the date of initial application). These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank as they are not involved in manufacturing business.
- IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Amendments to specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs to include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfill the contract and costs of contract management and supervision). General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. The Bank applied the amendments to the contracts for which it had not fulfilled all of its obligations at the beginning of the reporting period. These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank, as prior to the application of the amendments, the Bank had not identified any contracts as being onerous and the unavoidable costs under the contracts, which were the costs of fulfilling them, comprised of incremental costs directly related to the contracts and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities.

Accordingly, the adoption of the above amendments to accounting standards did not have any material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In addition to the above amendments to standards, improvements to various accounting standards (under the annual improvements 2018 - 2020 cycle) have also been issued by the IASB in May 2020. Such improvements were generally effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022:

- IFRS 16 Leases: Lease incentives – The amendment removes the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements in Illustrative Example 13 acBanking IFRS 16. This removes potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives when applying IFRS 16 and had no impact on the financial statements of the Bank.
- IAS 41 Agriculture: Taxation in fair value measurements – The amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 that entities exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of IAS 41. The adoption of the above improvements to the standards will have no material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

| addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an ‘expected credit losses’ (ECL) approach rather than the ‘incurred credit losses’ approach as currently followed.

| to clarify how to classify debt and other liabilities as current or non-current. In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:- What is meant by a right to defer settlement
- That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period
- That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right
- That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.
- Only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In addition, an entity has to disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that non-current liabilities with covenants could become repayable within twelve months.The amendments must be applied retrospectively and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. |                                                       | |

| Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by:- Replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies; and
- Adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.Earlier application of the amendments is permitted. Since the amendments to the Practice Statement 2 provide non-mandatory guidance on the application of the definition of material to accounting policy information, an effective date for these amendments is not necessary. The Bank is currently revisiting their accounting policy information disclosures to ensure consistency with the amended requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                       | |

| The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. Earlier application is permitted as long as this fact is disclosed. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                       |

## Chunk 705

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

The amendments should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

– IFRS 16 Leases - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - Amendments requires a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease. A seller-lessee applies the amendments retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application.

– IFRS 10 & IAS 28 - Consolidated Financial Statements & Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – (Amendment). The effective date of Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 has been deferred indefinitely (until the research project of IASB, on the equity method, has been concluded. Earlier application of the September 2014 amendments continues to be permitted. The Bank expects that the adoption of the amendments will have no material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.

Further, the following new standards have been issued by the IASB, which are yet to be notified by the SECP for the purpose of applicability in Pakistan:

| Standard                             | Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after) |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| IFRS 1 - First time Adoption of IFRS | January 01, 2024                                      |
| IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts        | January 01, 2023                                      |

The Bank expects that the adoption of the above standards will have no material effect on the Bank’s financial statements, in the period of initial application.

The SBP vide BPRD Circular no. 02 dated February 09, 2023 has specified the new reporting format for the financial statements of Banking companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements and will become applicable for the financial statements of the Bank for the year ending December 31, 2023.

## Chunk 706

# 2.4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the approved accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires the management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Estimates, underlying assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The areas where various assumptions and estimates are significant to the Bank’s financial statements or where judgment was exercised in application of accounting policies are as follows:

---

## Chunk 707

# 2.4.1 Provision against non-performing loans and advances

The Bank reviews its loan portfolio to assess amount of non-performing loans and advances and provision required there-against. While assessing this requirement various factors including the delinquency in the account, financial position of the borrower and the requirements of the Prudential Regulations are considered. The amount of general provision is determined in accordance with the requirements set out in Prudential Regulations.

---

## Chunk 708

# 2.4.2 Valuation and impairment of ‘available-for-sale’ equity investments

The Bank determines that ‘available-for-sale’ equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. This determination of what is significant and prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there is evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flows.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022

# 2.4.3 Defined benefit plans

Liability is determined on the basis of actuarial advice using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the liability and related expense are disclosed in note 35.

---

## Chunk 709

# 2.4.4 Classification of investments

- In classifying investments as ‘held-for-trading’ the Bank has determined securities which are acquired with the intention to trade by taking advantage of short term market or interest rate movements and are to be sold within 90 days.
- In classifying investments as ‘held-to-maturity’ the Bank follows the guidance provided in SBP circulars on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity.
- The investments, other than those in subsidiary, which are not classified as ‘held-for-trading’ or ‘held-to-maturity’ are classified as ‘available-for-sale’.

---

## Chunk 710

# 2.4.5 Depreciation and amortization and revaluation of operating fixed assets

In making estimates of the depreciation and amortization, the management uses method which reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Bank and estimates the useful life. The method applied and useful lives estimated are reviewed at each financial year end and if there is a change in the expected pattern or timing of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, the estimate would be changed to reflect the change in pattern. Such a change is accounted for as change in accounting estimates in accordance with International Accounting Standard 8 - Accounting Policies, ‘Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. Further, the bank estimates the revalued amount of land and buildings on a regular basis. The estimates are based on the valuations carried out by independent professional valuers under the market conditions.

---

## Chunk 711

# 2.4.6 Fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities

The fair value of the assets and liabilities is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Bank categorizes fair value measurements within the following fair value hierarchy:

- a) Level 1 - These are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bank can access at the measurement date.
- b) Level 2 - These are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
- c) Level 3 - These are input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable Inputs).

---

## Chunk 712

# 2.4.7 Lease term

The Bank applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

---

## Chunk 713

# 2.4.8 Income taxes

In making estimates for income taxes currently payable by the Bank, the management considers the current income tax laws and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past. There are certain matters where the Bank’s view differs with the view taken by the income tax authorities and such amounts are shown as a contingent liability.

# 4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements of the Group except for note 4.1 mentioned below which will be applicable from January 01, 2023. Significant accounting policies are enumerated as follows:

---

## Chunk 716

# 4.1 Change in accounting policy effective from January 01, 2023

IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ As directed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) vide BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at 31 December 2021. SBP finalized and issued the IFRS 9 Application Instructions vide same circular, for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

During the year 2022, the management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of IFRS 9 taking into account the SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of IFRS 9. However, the Bank expects an increase in the loss allowance resulting in a negative impact on equity. In addition, the Bank will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments. These changes and impacts are discussed below:

---

## Chunk 717

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of debt financial assets will depend on how these are managed (the entity’s business model) and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). The classification of equity instruments is generally measured as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) unless the Bank elects for Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) at initial recognition. The Bank has analyzed the impact of initial application of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

---

## Chunk 718

# Equity Securities

The Bank expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. For certain equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. For those equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI for which FVOCI election is not made, will, instead, be measured at fair value through profit or loss, which will increase volatility in recorded profit or loss for future periods. The revaluation surplus / deficit related to those securities in amount, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified to retained earnings however, there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification. Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9, however, SBP has allowed relaxation to the banks till one year to carry these investments under the current PR regime.

---

## Chunk 719

# Debt securities, Loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those passing the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell these investments. Debt securities currently classified as HTM and those passing SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the Group business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Cashflows of certain debt instruments classified in AFS and / or HTM categories, do not expect to give risk to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest and accordingly, these would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

## Chunk 720

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SICR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

# Hedge accounting

IFRS 9 aligns hedge accounting more closely with risk management activities and establishes a more principle-based approach to hedge accounting.

---

## Chunk 721

# Presentation and disclosure

IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Bank’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the IFRS 9.

The State Bank of Pakistan is yet to issue a revised format for financial statements of the banks for the accounting periods starting from 1 January 2023, which shall include the presentation and disclosures of adoption of IFRS 9 as applicable in Pakistan.

---

## Chunk 722

# Additional requirements and exceptions introduced by SBP Instructions

State Bank of Pakistan has enforced the application of IFRS 9 in its entirety except for some exceptions and additional requirements. A high-level comparison of such exceptions that are relevant to the Bank is as follows:

- Scope of application
Financial statements of overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates prepared for the purpose of consolidation at the bank level should be based on their respective host country’s regulatory accounting practices till one year from the effective date of IFRS 9 implementation (i.e. 1 January 2023). Afterwards, banks will be required to comply with the requirements of these application instructions for consolidated financial statements. These instructions will not apply on the standalone statutory financial statements of banks’ associates, subsidiaries and overseas branches that shall be prepared according to their rules and regulations applicable to them.
- Unquoted equity securities
SBP has advised banks to measure investment in unquoted equity securities at lower of cost or breakup value till December 31, 2023. In case where the breakup value of such securities is less than the cost, the difference of the cost and the breakup value will be classified as loss and provided for by charging it to the Profit and Loss account.
- Rebuttable presumptions
IFRS 9 includes a rebuttable presumption that a default does not occur later than 90 days past due and it also presumes that there is SICR if credit exposure is more than 30 days past due. In order to bring consistency, SBP has allowed the backstop to the rebuttable presumption of days past due of credit portfolio against a specific credit facility and its stage allocation under IFRS 9 as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022. However, banks are free to choose more stringent days past due criteria.

## Chunk 723

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# for the year ended December 31, 2022

# – Transfer out of Stage 3

An exposure cannot be upgraded from Stage 3 to 1 directly and should be upgraded to Stage 2 initially. For the purpose of reversal of provisions, the PRs requirements will be followed for Stage 3 assets.

# – Income recognition on impaired assets

The Banks are advised to recognize income on impaired assets (loans classified under PRs i.e. OAEM and Stage 3 loans) on a receipt basis in accordance with the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP.

---

## Chunk 724

# – Expected Credit Loss Model (ECL)

Credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, a two-track approach is required i.e. Stage 1 and stage 2 provision to be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3’s provision to be made higher of IFRS 9 ECL or PR’s requirement.

---

## Chunk 725

# – Impact of Provisions on Regulatory Capital

The banks are allowed to include provisions for Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Tier 2 capital up to a limit of 1.25% of total credit risk-weighted assets. In order to mitigate the impact of ECL provisioning on capital, a transitional arrangement is allowed to the banks to absorb the impact on regulatory capital. Accordingly, banks, which choose to apply transitional arrangement, may implement this arrangement in accordance with SBP’s Guideline for absorption of ECL for CAR Purposes as mentioned in Annexure-C of BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022.

---

## Chunk 726

# Loan / financing related fee

Loan origination / commitment fees that are regarded as compensation to the lender for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of a financial instrument would be recognized over the life of the related loan. However, if the commitment expires without the lender making the loan, the fee would be recognised as revenue as earned.

---

## Chunk 727

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.

---

## Chunk 728

# Classification and measurement

Based on the bank’s assessment, the IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have the following impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets and financial liabilities:

1. Debt instruments (amount of Rs. 22.451 million has been reclassified from AFS to FVTPL);
2. Equity instrument (amount of Rs. 17,546.986 million has been reclassified from AFS to FVOCI).

---

## Chunk 729

# Impairment

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank’s equity at January 01, 2023 is decrease in equity of approximately Rs. 937.16 million, representing corresponding impact of:

- A decrease of approximately Rs. 1,644.141 million related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of approximately Rs. 706.981 million related to deferred tax.

---

## Chunk 730

# Impact on regulatory capital

The introduction of IFRS 9 will result in reduction in regulatory capital of the banks, which is likely to reduce their lending capacity and ability to support their obligors. In order to mitigate the impact of expected credit loss (ECL) models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the FIs to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. Annexure B of the ‘Application Instructions’ issued by SBP have detailed the transitional arrangement.

The transitional arrangement must apply only to provisions for stage 1 and 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital.

Land is carried at revalued amount less any subsequent impairment losses if any, and is not depreciated while buildings are stated at cost or revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and any subsequent impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method, except buildings which are depreciated using the reducing balance method, to write down the cost of property and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The rates at which the fixed assets are depreciated are disclosed in note 10.2. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted, if required. Adjustments in residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are treated as change in accounting estimates.

# 4.6 Property and Equipment

Impairment loss of the same asset in the Profit and Loss Account, net of amortization or depreciation had no revaluation decrease/impairment been required for the asset in prior years. A decrease resulting from a revaluation is initially charged directly against any related revaluation surplus held in respect of that asset and the remaining portion being charged as an expense.

The surplus on revaluation of fixed assets to the extent of incremental depreciation (net of deferred tax) charged on the related assets is transferred directly to un-appropriated profit.

Revaluation of entire class of assets is carried out by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity (every third year) to ensure that the carrying amount of the entire class of assets does not differ materially from their fair value.

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the asset is derecognized, except that the related surplus on revaluation of fixed assets (net of deferred tax) is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Profit and Loss Account.

## Chunk 740

# b. Intangible assets

# 4.7 Lease liability and right of use asset

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount is remeasured/adjusted if there are changes in the future cash flows or the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. On subsequent measurement, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term as this method closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits. Carrying amount of the lease liability is derecognised upon termination of the lease contract with corresponding adjustment to right-of-use asset. Gain or loss on termination of lease contract is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

The Bank has elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense in the Profit or Loss Account on a straight-line basis.

# 18.2 Workers Welfare Fund

Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated November 10, 2016 held that the amendments made in the law through Finance Act 2008, introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Worker Welfare Fund (WWF) were unlawful. Federal Board of Revenue filed review petition against the subject order, which is currently pending for adjudication.

WWF provision from 2014 to 2019 has been maintained conservatively based on tax advisor’s opinion in view of provincial levy of WWF by the provinces with effect from 2014, including levy by Sindh which is under litigation.

Punjab Government has promulgated Punjab Workers Welfare Fund Act 2019 (PWWF) with effect from December 13, 2019, therefore, provision related to Punjab and pertaining to the period from 2014 till the date of promulgation of PWWF was reversed from the provision maintained for WWF from 2014 to 2019.

# Forward Exchange Contracts

Forward Exchange Contract (FEC) is a product which is offered to the obligor who transact internationally. These obligor use this product to hedge themselves from unfavorable movements in a foreign currency, however, by agreeing to fix the exchange rate, they do not benefit from favorable movements in that currency.

An FEC is a contract between the Obligor and the Bank in which both agree to exchange an amount of one currency for another currency at an agreed forward exchange rate for settlement over more than two business days after the FEC is entered into (the day on which settlement occurs is called the value date). FEC is entered with those Obligors whose credit worthiness has already been assessed, and they have underlined trade transactions.

If the relevant exchange rate moves un-favorably, Obligor will benefit from that movement because the Bank must exchange currencies at the FEC rate. In order to mitigate this risk of adverse exchange rate movement, the Bank hedges its exposure by taking opposite forward position in inter-bank FX.

---

## Chunk 825

# Foreign Exchange Swaps

A Foreign Exchange Swap (FX Swap) is used by the Bank if it has a need to exchange one currency for another currency on one day and then re-exchange those currencies at a later date. Exchange rates and forward margins are determined in the “inter-bank” market and fluctuate according to supply and demand.

An FX Swap prevents the Bank from gaining any benefit resulting from a favorable exchange rate movement in the relevant currency pair between the time Bank enters into the transaction deal and when settlement occurs. Cancellation of the swap may also result in exposure to market movements. The key advantage of an FX swap is that it provides the Bank with protection against unfavorable currency movements between the time it enters into the transaction and settlement. The term and amounts for FX Swap can also be tailored to suit the Bank’s particular needs.

# Equity Futures

An equity futures contract is a standardized contract, traded on a futures counter of the stock exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying script at a certain date in the future, at a specified price.

The Bank may use equity futures as a hedging instrument to hedge its equity portfolio, in both ‘held-for-trading’ and ‘available-for-sale’, against equity price risk. Only selected shares are allowed to be traded on futures exchange. Equity futures give flexibility to the Bank either to take delivery on the future settlement date or to settle it by adjusting the notional value of the contract based on the current market rates. Maximum exposure limit to the equity futures is 10% of Tier I Capital of the Bank, based on prevailing SBP regulations.

The accounting policies used to recognize and disclose derivatives are given in Note 4.16.2. The risk management framework of derivative instruments is given in note 43.

# Expected contributions to be paid to the funds in the next financial year

The Group contributes to the gratuity fund as per actuarial expected charge for the next financial year. No contributions are being made to pension due to surplus of fair value of plan’s assets over present value of defined obligation. Based on actuarial advice, management estimates that the charge or (reversal) in respect of defined benefit plans for the year ending December 31, 2023 would be as follows:

|                                                | Pension fund | Gratuity fund | Post retirement medical | Employees’ compensated absences |

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized within the statement of financial position.

# 35.16 Funding Policy

The Group endeavors to ensure that liabilities under the various employee benefit schemes are covered by the Fund on any valuation date having regards to the various actuarial assumptions such as projected future salary increase, expected future contributions to the fund, projected increase in liability associated with future service and the projected investment income of the Fund.

## Chunk 861

# 35.17 Risk associated with defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans may expose the group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, investment risk, salary increase risk and withdrawal rate risk as described below;

Longevity risks: The risk arises when the actual lifetime of retirees is longer than expectation. This risk is measured at the plan level over the entire retiree population.

Investment risks: The risk arises when the actual performance level of investment levels is lower than expectation and thus creating a shortfall in the funding objectives.

Salary increase risk: The most common type of retirement benefit is one where the final benefit is linked with final salary. The risk arises when the actual increases are higher than expectations and impact the liability accordingly.

Withdrawal Rate: The risk of actual withdrawals varying with the actuarial assumptions can impose a risk to the benefit obligation. The movement of the liability can go either way.

# 38 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 38.1 Fair value of financial assets

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices other than those classified as “held to maturity”. Quoted
securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in
associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available
audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings
cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities
and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been
calculated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy as stated in note 4.5 to these consolidated financial statements.

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making
the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial
instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included
in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term
Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.
unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy
into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

| Item                                           | Valuation approach and input used                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Federal Government Securities                  | Marked to Market on the basis of PKRV & PKFRV rates.                          |
| Non-Government Debt Securities                 | Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates.                                 |
| Foreign Exchange Contracts                     | Marked to Market on the basis of SBP rates.                                   |
| Open Ended Mutual Funds                        | Marked to Market on the basis of MUFAP rates.                                 |
| Operating Fixed Assets (Land & Building) & NBA | The valuation is based on their assessment of market value of the properties. |

# 42 RISK MANAGEMENT

The principal risks associated with the Group’s business are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, operational risk, and information security & governance risk and Shariah Non-Compliance Risk. The Risk Management Framework (henceforth to be referred to as ‘The Framework’) provides principles for identifying, assessing, and monitoring risk within the Bank. The Framework specifies the key elements of the risk management process in order to maximize opportunities, minimize adversities and to achieve improved outputs based on informed decision making.

The Bank performs risk measurement, monitoring and control functions through use of various risk procedures and models. To give it a formal structure, all the policies and guidelines are approved by the Board and relevant management committees. Risk management functions have been segregated by business specialization, i.e., Credit Risk, Credit Administration, Technical Appraisal, Information Security and Enterprise Risk which inter alia includes Policy and Procedure, Risk Architecture, Reputational Risk, Operational Risk and Market & Liquidity Risk. All these functions are operating in tandem to improve and maintain the health of the Bank’s assets and liabilities.

# Liquidity Risk

The risk that the Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn without incurring unacceptable cost or losses.

# Operational Risk

Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. The definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic risk and reputational risk.

## Chunk 889

# 42.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk, the potential default of one or more debtors, is a major source of risk for the Bank. The Bank is exposed to credit risk through its lending and investment activities. The Bank’s credit risk function is divided into Corporate and Financial Institutions Risk and Commercial, SME and Consumer Risk. The functions operate within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes. The credit risk management activities are governed by the Credit Policy of the Bank that defines the respective roles and responsibilities, the credit risk management principles and the Bank’s credit risk strategy. The policy is supported by a comprehensive Credit Procedures Manual.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk:

- Sovereign credit risk on its public sector advances
- Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances
- Counterparty credit risk on interbank limits

---

## Chunk 890

# Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it prefers obtaining a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the Government of Pakistan (GOP). However, certain public sector enterprises have a well defined cash flow stream and appropriate business model, based on which the lending is secured through collaterals other than GOP guarantee.

---

## Chunk 891

# Counterparty credit risk on its private sector advances

Each borrower’s credit worthiness is analyzed on the Credit Application Package that incorporates a formalized and structured approach for credit analysis and directs the focus of evaluation towards a balanced assessment of credit risk with identification of proper mitigants. These risks include Industry Risk, Business Risk, Financial Risk, Security Risk and Account Performance Risk. Financial analysis is further strengthened through use of separate financial spread sheet templates that have been designed for manufacturing / trading concerns, financial institutions and insurance companies.

---

## Chunk 892

# Counter Party Credit Risk on Interbank Limits

In the normal course of its business, the Bank’s Treasury utilizes products such as Reverse REPO and call lending to meet the needs of interbank borrowers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in market, interest and currency rates. Further, these products are also used to temporarily invest Bank’s liquidity prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty in the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Reflecting a preference for minimizing exposure to counterparty credit risk, the Bank maintains eligibility criteria that link the exposure limits to counterparty credit ratings by external rating agencies.

---

## Chunk 893

# A. Country Risk

The Bank has in place a Country Risk Management Framework which has been approved by the Board. This framework focuses on providing detailed roles and responsibilities with respect to country risk assessment as well as limit setting, exposure management and reporting of cross border exposure undertaken by the Bank. The Bank utilizes S&P, Fitch and Moody’s country ratings as well as other macroeconomic and external risk factors in assigning a country risk limit. The Financial Institutions Division is responsible for monitoring of country exposure limits.

---

## Chunk 894

# Credit Administration

Credit Administration is involved in minimizing losses that could arise due to security and documentation deficiencies. The Credit Administration Function constantly monitors the security and documentation risks inherent in the existing credit portfolio through four regional credit administration departments located in major cities. Further, Credit Monitoring Division ensures implementation of all post disbursement activities as per bank guidelines to safeguard interests of the Bank through its three units i.e. Classification & Monitoring, Vigilance and Warehouse Management.

# 42.2.3 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates.

The majority of the Group’s net foreign currency exposure is in US$ and the Group uses system-based monitoring of its intra-day Net Open Position for effective risk management.

The Group’s FX Risk is largely mitigated by following a matched funding policy, whereas, for any mismatched exposures, the Group utilizes appropriate derivative instruments such as Forwards and Swaps. The Group maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against foreign exchange risk.

# 42.2.4 Equity position Risk

Equity Price Risk is risk to earnings or capital that results from adverse changes in stock prices (single stocks, or a basket of stocks, or overall stock market). ABL holds a diversified portfolio of equity investments in order to minimize non-systematic risk while retaining acceptable systematic risk. ALCO ensures that equity price risk is mitigated through prudent portfolio management. The Group maintains adequate regulatory capital to cover against equity price risk. Equity investments classified as “Held-for-Trading” as well as listed non-strategic equity investments classified as “Available-for-Sale” are part of the “Trading Book” and are subject to market risk change as specified by the Basel Framework. Un-listed and listed strategic equity investment are part of the “Banking Book” and are subject to credit risk charge as specified by the Basel Framework.

# 42.2.5 Yield / Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)–Basel II Specific

Interest rate and Rate of return risk is the current or prospective risk of losses, to both the Bank’s capital and earnings, arising from movements in interest rates and rates of return. The Bank has a robust system in place to monitor Interest rate risk and ALCO regularly analyses the interest rate scenario and devises strategies to minimize adverse impact of interest rate risk on the Bank’s equity and profits.

Interest rate risk is measured through “duration” of an instrument. To assess the interest rate risk at Balance Sheet and Income Statement level, gap analysis on “re-pricing schedule” is utilized. Re-pricing schedule is a distribution of interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet positions into a number of predefined time bands according to their maturity (if fixed-rate) or time remaining to their next re-pricing (if floating-rate), and is calculated in compliance with SBP instructions. For non-contractual assets and liabilities, an ALCO approved methodology is utilized to place these assets and liabilities in the re-pricing schedule. This methodology is based on the results of a behavioural analysis which statistically models the historical trends of the last 5 years.

Government securities (PIBs & T-Bills, Sukuks), Bonds, Debentures, etc. and other money market investments are subject to interest rate / rate of return risk. To capture the risk associated with these securities, extensive modeling is being done with respect to duration analysis. Stress testing and scenario-based models are also in place to capture the sensitivity of the portfolio to adverse movement in interest rates. For prudent risk management, all money market investments are marked to market to assess changes in the market value of investments due to interest rate movements. Yield/ Interest rate sensitivity position for on-balance sheet instruments is based on the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity date and for off-balance sheet instruments is based on settlement date.

In accordance with BSD Circular No.03 of 2011, issued by the SBP, Bank is required to report interest rate sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities on the basis of an objective and systematic behavioural study which is approved by ALCO.

# 42.3 Operational Risk

The Group, like all financial institutions, is exposed to different types of operational risks, including the potential losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information, communication, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and the execution of legal, fiduciary and agency responsibilities.

In accordance with the BoD approved Operational Risk Management Policy (ORM), Group maintains a system of internal controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in view of the Group’s financial strength and the characteristics of the activities and market in which it operates. These internal controls are periodically updated to conform to industry best practices.

The Group has implemented workflow based system “Risk Nucleus” for Operational Risk Loss Data Collection & Reporting, Risk Control & Self Assessment (RCSA) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) monitoring. Further, major Operational Risk events are also analyzed from the control breaches perspective and mitigating controls are assessed on design and operating effectiveness. Quarterly updates on Operational Risk events are presented to senior management and Board’s Risk Management Committee & BoD.

The Group has a BoD approved BCP policy and Business Continuity Plan applicable to all its functional areas. The Group updates functional BCPs on annual basis or at any process change.

The Group is also implementing internationally accepted Integrated Framework on Internal Control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), with a view to consolidate and enhance the existing internal control processes.

The Group with permission of SBP is conducting a parallel run for Alternate Standardized Approach (ASA) for Basel II – Operational Risk Capital Charge Reporting, which signifies efforts of the Group for advance approach.

Outbreak of COVID 19 and continuous resurgence of the pandemic waves due to mutation of the virus has been a cause of concern for the Grouping industry and required continuous monitoring and transformation in the existing way of doing business. The operating procedures of the Group were transformed and business continuity plan were updated in line with the guidelines issued by the Government, Health Care and Regulatory Authorities, in a timely manner to minimize the impact of disruption on business activities and on service delivery to the customers without compromise to the safety of all the stakeholders including customers and employees in particular.

# 42.4 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Group is unable to fund its current obligations and operations in the most cost efficient manner. The Group’s Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility to Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) for ensuring that Bank’s policy for liquidity management is adhered to on a continual basis. ALCO uses gap analysis based on “maturity schedule” to assess the Group’s liquidity risk and devise strategy accordingly. The Group has various limits and triggers in place to monitor liquidity risk on a periodic basis, while it also utilizes stress testing to assess adequacy of Bank’s liquid assets. The Group complies with State Group of Pakistan’s instructions on Liquidity Standards as prescribed under the Basel III Framework.

Daily liquidity management is carried out centrally by the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Desk in Treasury Group which manages the day to day liquidity needs of the Group. Funding and liquidity management strategies are regularly discussed during Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings. The discussions include analysis on composition of deposits and tenure, funding gaps and concentration, monitoring of short and long-term liquidity ratios (including Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio). The Group utilizes internal Management Action Triggers and Limits which act as early warning indicators and safeguards to ensure sufficient liquidity buffers at all times. Additionally, stress tests are performed to evaluate available liquidity under a range of adverse scenarios and to identify potential vulnerabilities in portfolios. The Group also has in place contingency funding plan that identifies specific management actions that can be invoked in times of liquidity crisis.

The Group has in place a robust Recovery Plan in place to deal with any liquidity crisis in the most efficient and effective manner. SBP initiatives such as deferral of principal and rescheduling and restructuring of loans may have an adverse effect on liquidity and maturity profile of the Group, however the Group holds sufficient liquidity buffer to absorb any unforeseen shocks during the prevailing situation. Moreover, the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Group continues to regularly monitor the liquidity position of the Group in view of emerging risks.

# Liquidity Risk Mitigation Techniques

The Group uses the following tools to identify and mitigate Liquidity Risk:

- Gap Analysis
- Liquidity Ratios
- Liquidity Stress Testing
- Contingency Funding Plan
- Risk Control Limits (RCLs)
