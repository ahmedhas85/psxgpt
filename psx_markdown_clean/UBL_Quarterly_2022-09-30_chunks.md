## Chunk 6

# Performance Overview

On a standalone basis, UBL recorded Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 50.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with a strong growth of 29% year on year.

The Bank’s gross revenues were recorded at Rs. 94.9 billion for 9M’22, an increase of 34% against the corresponding period of last year. Net mark-up income stood at Rs. 72.8 billion for 9M’22, with a significant increase of 36% year on year as a result of a well-positioned investment book and efficient cost of deposits.

Non-markup income stood at Rs. 22.1 billion for 9M’22 which is up 28%, owing to strong growth across all major fee-based revenues.

The Bank’s operating expenses stood at Rs. 37.8 billion for 9M’22, and are up 21% year on year, as a result of significantly higher inflation levels, steep decline in the value of PKR and higher overheads across the network. Despite the increase in the expense base, the cost to income ratio continues to improve and is down to 39.8% for 9M’22 as compared to 44.0% last year.

The Bank recorded a net provisioning expense of Rs. 5.4 billion for 9M’22 (9M’21: net provision reversal of Rs. 415 million), mainly to build coverage against the foreign currency denominated investments held within UBL International.

Resultantly, the average current to total deposits ratio improved to 44.3% in 9M’22 from 42.0% in 9M’21.

# Capital Ratios

The Bank seeks to maintain a strong capital base that provides a solid foundation for future growth as well as maintaining adequate buffers over regulatory requirements.

However, the Bank was required to meet the HLA capital surcharge, in the form of additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) capital of 1.0% on a standalone and consolidated basis till June 30, 2022. As a result of the updated assessment, the minimum capital requirement for UB has been reduced from 12.5% as at June 30, 2022, to 11.5% from Sep’22 onwards, on both a standalone and consolidated basis.

The overall CAR stood at 18.4% at Sep’22 (Dec’21: 21.5%), with a buffer of 6.9% over the minimum regulatory requirement of 11.5%. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) ratio stood at 12.7% at Sep’22 (Dec’21: 15.1%). Total Tier 1 Capital ratio was measured at 13.7% at Sep’22 (Dec’21: 16.3%).

# Economy Review

The country’s external account troubles continue to negatively impact the domestic economy. The situation was further exacerbated by the recent flooding, which has caused significant damage to the lives and livelihood of a substantial segment of the population.

The country’s Current Account recorded a deficit of USD 1.9 billion for 2M FY’23, a decline 19% over the

Quarterly Report September 30, 2022  05

United Bank Limited

Corresponding period of last year. Balance of trade recorded a deficit of USD 9.2 billion for Q1 FY’23 versus a deficit of USD 11.7 billion last year. Exports were recorded at USD 7.1 billion for Q1 FY’23, recording a meagre growth of 1.8% while imports were recorded at USD 16.3 billion, a decline of 12.7% year on year. Home remittances stood at USD 7.7 billion for 3M FY’23, down 6% year on year.

Inflation levels continue to remain at historic high levels as CPI was measured at 23.2% for Sep’22 as against 9.0% in Sep’21.

There are certain amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become applicable to the Bank for accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Bank has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

The income tax authorities have issued amended assessment orders for the tax years 2003 to 2021, and created additional tax demands (including disallowances of provisions made prior to Seventh Schedule) of Rs.14,668 million (2021: Rs.13,752 million). The Bank has filed appeals before the various appellate forums against these amendments. Where the appellate authorities have allowed relief on certain issues, the assessing authorities have filed appeals before higher appellate forums.

The management of the Bank is confident that the appeals will be decided in favor of the Bank.

# 22.3 Other contingent liabilities

# 22.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

11,297,852         12,362,885

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security). Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 22.3.2

During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty. The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.

# 34. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 82

# 34.1

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the central bank of Yemen, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana’a to facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch’s control. UBL is cognizant of the associated risks of ceasing its branch’s business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 except for the following:

During the period, the Group has reviewed the useful lives of its leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and electrical, office and computer equipment as required by IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment. This review has resulted in a change in the useful lives of these assets. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Accordingly, the effect of this change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the consolidated condensed interim profit and loss account from the current period.

With effect from January 2022, the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements and certain items of furniture and fixtures have been decreased from 10 to 8 years and, certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment from 5 to 4 years and 4 to 3 years. Further, useful lives of certain items of electrical, office and computer equipment have been increased from 4 to 5 years. The useful lives have been revised to make them more reflective of the consumption pattern of the assets.

# 22.1

The Income Tax returns of the Bank have been filed upto the tax year 2021 (accounting year ended December 31, 2020) and were deemed to be assessed under section 120 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance). The Income Tax authorities have issued amended assessment orders for the tax years 2003 to 2021, and created additional tax demands (including disallowances of provisions made prior to Seventh Schedule) of Rs.14,668 million (December 31, 2021: Rs.13,752 million). The Group has filed appeals before the various appellate forums against these amendments. Where the appellate authorities have allowed relief on certain issues, the assessing authorities have filed appeals before higher appellate forums. Where the appellate authorities have not allowed relief the Group has filed appeals before higher appellate forums. The management of the Group is confident that the appeals will be decided in favour of the Group.

The tax returns for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) branches have been filed upto the tax year 2022 (financial year ended December 31, 2021) under the provisions of section 120(1) read with section 114 of the Ordinance and in compliance with the terms of the agreement between banks and the Azad Kashmir Council in May 2005. The returns filed are considered as deemed assessment orders under the law.

The tax authorities have also carried out monitoring for Federal Excise Duty, Sales tax and withholding taxes covering period from year ended 2005 to 2019.

| 24.3.1 Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 11,297,852        | 12,362,885                       |            |
| These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Group from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                   |                                  |            |
| Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Group's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Group is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.                                                                            |                   |                                  |            |
| 24.3.2 During 2016, penalties amounting to Rs. 4.089 billion were levied by the FE Adjudication Court of the State Bank of Pakistan relating to alleged contraventions of the requirements of foreign exchange regulations with respect to issuance and certification of E-Forms by the Bank to certain customers (exporters) who failed to submit the export documents there against. |                   |                                  |            |
| Consequently, foreign exchange on account of export proceeds have not been repatriated. The Bank maintains that it fully discharged its liability, in accordance with the law and has filed a civil suit in the High Court of Sindh challenging the levy of the penalty.                                                                                                               |                   |                                  |            |
| The High Court has granted a stay on action being taken against the Bank. The management, based on the advice from legal counsel, is confident that the view of the Bank will prevail and the Bank will not be exposed to any loss on this account.                                                                                                                                    |                   |                                  |            |
| 24.3.3 Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice to UBL Fund Managers Limited requiring them to pay sales tax under Punjab sales tax on Service Act 2012 on management fee earned in Punjab from May 22, 2013.                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |                                  |            |
| The Company has filed a petition on July 8, 2015 in the High Court of Sindh. A favorable outcome of this petition is expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                   |                                  |            |

# 36. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

## Chunk 199

# 36.1

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The SBP through its BSD Circular No. 07 dated April 15, 2009 has prescribed the minimum paid-up capital (net of accumulated losses) for Banks to be raised to Rs.10,000 million by the year ending December 31, 2015. The paid-up capital of the Bank for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 stood at Rs.12,241.797 million (December 31, 2021: Rs.12,241.797 million) and is in compliance with SBP requirements. Banks are also required to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 10.0% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of the risk weighted assets of the Bank. In order to dampen the effects of COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan under BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020 has given a regulatory relief and reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as prescribed vide BPRD Circular No. 6 of August 15, 2013, for the time being, from its existing level of 2.5% to 1.5%, till further instructions. In accordance with the Basel III instructions, Banks are also required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio and Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and 7.5%, respectively, as at September 30, 2022. The Bank is fully compliant with prescribed ratios as the Bank’s CAR is 17.01% whereas CET 1 and Tier 1 ratios stood at 11.88% and 12.69% respectively.

## Chunk 234

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022

# 41. YEMEN OPERATIONS

The political and economic instability resulting from the ongoing civil war in Yemen raised insurmountable challenges for the UBL-Yemen Branch including difficulties emanating from the bankruptcy of the central bank of Yemen Sana’a, severe shortage of liquid funds in the Yemeni local market and non-cooperation of CBY Sana’a to facilitate liquidity.

While UBL-Yemen Branch has been striving to honour its liabilities for the past seven years notwithstanding continued operational losses, it is no longer possible for the branch to continue its operations in Yemen due to reasons not attributable to the branch and circumstances entirely beyond UBL or its branch’s control. UBL is cognizant of the associated risks of ceasing its branch’s business in Yemen but has concluded that in the totality of circumstances it is prudent to do so. UBL will monitor the situation in Yemen so that it may appropriately deal with the associated risks.
