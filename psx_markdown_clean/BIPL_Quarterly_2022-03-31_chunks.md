Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present the interim report of BankIslami Pakistan Limited (‘BankIslami’ or ‘the Bank’) for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

## Chunk 6

# Economic Snapshot

Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), post March 31, 2022, has raised the policy rate by 250 bps to 12.25% to counter the impact of domestic inflation, currency devaluation and rising trend in international commodity prices. Moreover, to further control the impact of inflation, SBP has also taken measures by increasing the export refinance rates by 250 bps to 5.5% and has widened the suite of import items subject to cash margin requirement.

On international front, global commodity prices, including oil, are likely to remain elevated and US Fed Reserve is expected to increase benchmark rates relatively at much quicker pace than anticipated previously, which eventually would lead to further tightening of global financial conditions. Keeping these factors in consideration, average inflation forecast has now been revised upwards to slightly above 11 percent for FY22. Year on Year inflation stood at 12.7% in March 2022 as opposed to 9.1% in March 2021.

Current Account Deficit stood significantly high at USD 12 Bn for 8MFY22 (Jul 21 to Feb 22) mainly due to rise in imports viz-a-viz exports and external payments. The cumulative figure of imports of goods and services during 8MFY22 were USD 54.9 Bn against USD 37.2 Bn during the same period last fiscal year (i.e. up by 48%), whereas exports have increased by 26% only during the same period i.e. from USD 16.3 Bn (8MFY21) to USD 20.6 Bn (8MFY22). For FY22, CA Deficit is expected to be around 4 percent of GDP which will largely remain dependent on overall global commodity prices.

Overall economic growth is still expected to range between 4% - 5%. However, actual outcome will be largely dependent upon political stability of the country and how commodity prices will shape up on account of tension between Russia and Ukraine.

In order to improve the overall deposit mix and profitability of the Bank, the Bank continued its focus on current account (CA) during 1Q22. Despite rise in policy rates, the Bank was able to maintain its CA deposits at March 31, 2022 as compared to CA deposits at December 31, 2021, while it has shed high cost deposits. Owing to this, a decline of 3.7% was witnessed in overall Deposits of the Bank during 1Q22. However, when compared with the Deposit position at the end of March 31, 2021, BankIslami’s total deposits have registered a year on year growth of 14.4%. It is pertinent to mention here that, the Bank in line with its business strategy will remain poised towards enhancing its current account base which will be complimented by expansion in branch network, increase in corporate & trade based relationships and garnering clients through its state-of-the-art and digitally enabled cash management services.

In line with growth in (i) macroeconomic indicators of the country; (ii) overall domestic demand and; (iii) banking spreads on account of increase in policy rates, the Bank diverted its surplus funds to better yielding corporate and consumer segments. Accordingly, the Bank witnessed a decline in treasury book by 21.8%, while net Islamic Financing grew by 8.2%. Moreover, with growth in overall size of credit book and recoveries from delinquent portfolio, infection ratio of the Bank has improved from 8.7% in Dec’21 to 8.1% in Mar’22 with coverage ratios (including general provision) improving to 91.4% in Mar’22 versus 89.6% in Dec’21.

## Chunk 9

# Quarterly Report March 2022

Going forward, the Bank will remain inclined towards expanding its corporate, SME, auto and agri finance book backed by its dynamic risk management structure however, it may adapt a relatively cautious approach towards housing segment on account of rising benchmark profit rates.

In line with rise in policy rates, gradual repricing of Bank’s asset book, improvement in CA deposit mix and persistent growth in BankIslami’s financing book, Net Spreads Earned witnessed a robust growth of 35.5% during 1Q22 versus 1Q21. On the top of it, Non Funded Income of the Bank also witnessed an impressive growth of 61.8% during 1Q22 vis-à-vis 1Q21 which was primarily attributable to income earned by means of Digital Delivery Channels and rise in FX income due to growth in trade business and volatility in exchange rates during 1Q22.

Operating expenses of the Bank rose by 22.1% mainly due to increase in inflation, induction of business related staff and rise in variable cost linked with growing number of transactions and business volumes. Despite increase in administrative expenses, cost to income ratio of the Bank has improved in 1Q22 to 66.7% versus 76.3% in 1Q21.

With growth in net spreads, fee based income and FX income, operating profit of the Bank improved to Rs. 1,339 Mn during 1Q’22 as compared to Rs. 684 Mn recorded during 1Q’21 i.e. growth of 95.8%. Provisioning against non-performing assets of the Bank depicted an increase of Rs. 419 Mn on account of charging additional provisioning against existing and potential delinquencies so as to improve overall credit risk profile of the Bank. Based on foregoing, the Bank posted Profit After Tax amounting to Rs. 522 Mn for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, depicting a growth of 33.9% from PAT of Rs. 390 Mn posted during same period last year, Alhamdulillah.

| 13.1 The Bank has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 6,783.931 million as at March 31, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Bank would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 2,374.376 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Bank, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realisability of the deferred tax asset. |                |                                |             |

The Holding Company has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 6,783.931 million as at March 31, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Holding Company would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 2,374.376 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Holding Company, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realizability of the deferred tax asset.

|      | The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity or investments in associates and subsidiary, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost less impairment losses. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiary, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted Shariah compliant securities, fixed term financing, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                  |                                    |   |
