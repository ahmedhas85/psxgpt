# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. The accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting comprise of:

- International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Accounting Standards) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as are notified under the Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017;
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017; and
- Directives issued by the SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Wherever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives have been followed.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The SBP through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 had deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

## Chunk 21

# 2.1.1

The disclosures made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting". These do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual audited unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2024.

# 2.1.2

These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent separate financial statements of Bank Alfalah Limited in which investment in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for on the basis of cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 2.1.3

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 43 to these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.4

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

# 2.2 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are effective in the current period:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not relevant or do not have any material effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements except for IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the impact of which is disclosed under note 4.1.

## Chunk 23

# 2.3 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to published accounting and reporting standards that are not yet effective:

There are certain new and amended standards, issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations and amendments that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 01, 2025 but are considered not to be relevant or will not have any material effect on the Bank's financial statements except for:

IFRS 18 is yet to be adopted in Pakistan. IFRS 18 when adopted and applicable shall impact the presentation of 'Statement of Profit and Loss Account' with certain additional disclosures in the condensed interim in the unconsolidated financial statements.
- amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which clarify the date of recognition and derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability including settlement of liabilities through banking instruments and channels including electronic transfers. The amendment when applied may impact the timing of recognition and derecognition of financial liabilities.
- amendment to IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange which will require Banks to apply a consistent approach in assessing whether a currency can be exchanged into another currency and, when it cannot, in determining the exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide.

# 4 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

## Chunk 26

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

The Bank adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach for restatement permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 2,751.995 million was recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the previous accounting period.

The Bank, in compliance with extended timelines defined in SBP's BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 had incorporated certain IFRS 9 related impacts in the last quarter of 2024. Therefore the unconsolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account (un-audited) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 has been restated to incorporate there impacts. Had the restatement not been incorporated the profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 8.455 million. The details are tabulated below:

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgment in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by the management in applying the Bank's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation were the same as those applied in the preparation of annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 except for matters related to adoption of IFRS 9 which have been disclosed in note 4.1 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 24.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of collateral assets (such as hypothecated / mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), damage to reputation and cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages. Based on legal advices and/or internal assessments, management is confident that the matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

| Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified at amortised cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. |                                          |
| In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                          |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 39.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

- (a) Financial instruments in level 1
Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies, listed GoP Sukuks and listed non government debt securities.
- (b) Financial instruments in level 2
Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.
- (c) Financial instruments in level 3
Financial instruments included in level 3 comprise of unlisted ordinary shares, unlisted preference shares, redeemable participating certificates and advances measured at fair value through profit and loss. Valuation techniques are mentioned in the table below.

The fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 39.3.2 Fair value of non-financial assets

Certain categories of property and equipment (land and buildings) and non banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts (level 3 measurement) determined by professional valuers based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in notes 12 and 15. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the State Bank of Pakistan.

The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 43.9 PLS Pool Management- Islamic Banking Group (IBG)

# 43.9.1 The pools, their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The profit and loss sharing between the Rabbul Maal (depositor) and Mudarib (Bank - IBG) is based upon the underlying principles of Mudaraba, where the Bank also contributes its equity to general pool of funds, and becomes the capital provider.

---

## Chunk 110

# Currently IBG is managing following pools:

1. General Pool for LCY Depositors
2. FCY Pool for Foreign Currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs Pool for Treasury Purposes
4. IERS Pool for Islamic Export Refinance Scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Islamic financing and related assets, investments, and placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the weightage system. The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under the SBP IERS Scheme. The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. All pools are usually exposed to general credit risk, asset ownership risk and profit rate risk of the underlying assets involved in pool.

# 44  AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS

Bank Alfalah maintains a two-branch presence in Afghanistan. The Board and the management of the Bank continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to the country's frozen reserves and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The Bank has taken impairment against net assets where there is an indication that carrying amount may be higher than its recoverable amount. The Bank remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.

Moreover, Alfalah Insurance Company Limited has deferred the application of IFRS 9 till January 01, 2026, which is same as effective date for application of IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts as allowed by the SECP through S.R.O. 506(i)/2024 dated March 29, 2024. Furthermore, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited was granted a partial exemption from the application of IFRS 9 till December 31, 2025 vide SECP S.R.O. 1784(I)/2024- dated November 04, 2024.

# 2.1.1

The disclosures made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on the format prescribed by the SBP through BPRD Circular Letter No. 02 dated February 09, 2023 and the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting". These do not include all the information and disclosures required for annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Basis of consolidation

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those return through its power over the investee. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Associates are those entities on which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating polices. Associates as well as investment in mutual funds established under trust structure are accounted for using the equity method. Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary which are not owned by the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

# 2.1.3

Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches are disclosed in note 43 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# 2.1.4

The management of the Holding company believes that there is no significant doubt on the Group company's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

The Holding Company adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach for restatement permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 2,751.995 million was recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the previous accounting period.

The Holding Company, in compliance with extended timelines defined in SBP's BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 01 dated January 22, 2025 had incorporated certain IFRS 9 related impacts in the last quarter of 2024. Therefore the consolidated condensed interim statement of profit and loss account (un-audited) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 has been restated to incorporate these impacts. Had the restatement not been incorporated the profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 would have been higher by Rs. 8.455 million. The details are tabulated below:

| Head                                 | (Rupees in '000) | Description                                                                         |

# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses as well as in the disclosure of contingent liabilities. It also requires management to exercise judgment in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by the management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation were the same as those applied in the preparation of annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 except for matters related to adoption of IFRS 9 which have been disclosed in note 4.1 to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

# FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The financial risk management objectives and policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those disclosed in the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government through the Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers' Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petitions is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers' Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

# 40 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as amortised cost, is based on quoted market price. Quoted debt securities classified at amortised cost are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of valuation methodologies. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

## Chunk 205

# 40.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 40.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies, listed GoP Sukuks and listed non government debt securities.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts, forward government securities contracts, cross currency swap and interest rate swaps.

(c) Financial instruments in level 3

Financial instruments included in level 3 comprise of unlisted ordinary shares, unlisted preference shares, redeemable participating certificates and advances measured at fair value through profit and loss. Valuation techniques are mentioned in the table below. The fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Group's properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical, comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements.

43.1 The Holding Company has opted for transition arrangement to phase in ECL impact as permitted by SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022. Had the transitional arrangement not applied, CAR and Leverage ratio would have been 17.56% and 4.13% respectively.



AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS
Bank Alfalah maintains a two-branch presence in Afghanistan. The Board and the management of the Bank continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to the country's frozen reserves and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The Holding Company has taken impairment against net assets where there is an indication that carrying amount may be higher than its recoverable amount. The Holding Company remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.
