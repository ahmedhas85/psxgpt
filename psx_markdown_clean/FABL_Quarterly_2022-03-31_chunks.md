## Chunk 9

# Economic Update

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in its emergency meeting on April 7, 2022, decided to raise the policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25%. As per MPC statement, an elevated inflationary outlook and external vulnerabilities are the reasons for this rate increase. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted 4% economic growth for the current fiscal year due to sluggish domestic demand caused by monetary tightening and fiscal consolidation measures taken in January 2022. The average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for 9MFY22 stood at 10.77% as monthly readings remained above.

# For the quarter ended March 31, 2022

12% for the fourth consecutive month. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has revised its inflation expectation upwards from 9-11% to above 11% for Fiscal Year 22 (FY ’22).

Trade deficit for the first nine months of FY ‘22 widened by 70% to USD 35.4 billion as exports increased by 25% (to USD 23.3 billion) and imports rose by 49% (to USD 58.7 billion). During July to February FY ’22, workers’ remittances increased by 7.6% to USD 20.1 billion. The current account posted a deficit of USD 12.1 billion for the eight months of current fiscal year against a surplus of USD 994 million last year. The SBP expects the current account deficit to be around 4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the current fiscal year. Owing to the increase in trade deficit, USD/PKR parity depreciated to 183.48 from 157.87, at the start of FY ‘22, i.e. a depreciation of 16.2%.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected revenue of PKR 4.38 trillion during July to March FY ‘22, a growth of 29.1% from last year. FBR exceeded the target by PKR 247 billion due to higher import taxes. The fiscal deficit during July to January FY ‘22 was recorded at 2.9% of GDP (PKR 1,862 billion) against 2.4% of GDP (PKR 1,309 billion) last year. Similarly, the primary balance posted a deficit of PKR 174 billion during this period as compared with surplus of PKR 416 billion during the same period last year.

Inflationary pressures continue to be the major concern facing the global economy. The shock to energy and food prices from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing supply chain constraints from the pandemic are the major reasons of this inflationary pressure. The World Bank has stated that the global economic growth may slow down to 4.1% this year from an estimated 5.5% in 2021. Looking ahead for Pakistan, heightened uncertainty about domestic politics and continuation of IMF program has contributed to a sharp rise in Pakistan’s Eurobond yields. With a change in government, political stability and attaining the next tranche from IMF (in turn mobilizing funding from other multilateral agencies) will be key in putting Pakistan on the path of lower inflation, sufficient foreign reserves and anchored current account and fiscal deficits.

Net markup income at PKR 7,182 million registered impressive growth of 32% over corresponding period.

Non markup income at PKR 2,139 million was 3.9% lower than first quarter of 2021. The primary reason for this decline was PKR 120 million loss on securities realized largely due to

The bearish stock market conditions prevailing during the quarter under review. Excluding loss on securities, non-markup income showed robust growth of 24.5%. Rising inflation and increase in branch network led to an increase of PKR 1,283 million or 27.4% in non-markup expenses.

Accordingly profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 at PKR 2,134 million was 1.4% higher than corresponding period last year.

On the balance sheet side deposits grew by 0.8% to PKR 649.2 billion. The Bank concentrated on reducing cost of deposit during the quarter and saw significant growth in low-cost deposits. Advances increased by 1.8% from December ’21 level to PKR 403.5 billion. Liquidity generated from borrowings from financial institutions was invested in government securities, as a result investment are higher by 12.0% at PKR 400.5 billion.

|        | The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) \[CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter. |         |                | 4,122,244         |

There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 30,799 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.

Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

## Chunk 73

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# 17

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

| Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. |

| Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements. |

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

---

## Chunk 114

# 2.2

The financial results of the Islamic banking branches have been consolidated in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes after eliminating inter branch transactions and balances. The financial results of all Islamic banking branches are disclosed in note 39 to these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

## Chunk 115

# 3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Company from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Company by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Company in the consolidated financial statements.




The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated. Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] has deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department has filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). Recently, ATIR has passed an order and maintained the decision of CIR(A) in favor of Holding Company, confirming that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.

(ii) There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 30,799 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million).

The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Holding Company for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessments, management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Holding Company's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Holding Company is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2008      | Order u/s 221 dated June 30, 2014    | Appeal pending before the Commissioner Appeals | 315                    |
| 2013      | Show cause u/s 221 dated May 7, 2014 | Showcause notice has been responded to         | 503                    |
| Total     |                                      |                                                | 818                    |

The management is of the view that WWF was not applicable for tax year 2008. In tax year 2013, subsequent to clarification decision by the SHC, the management has not admitted WWF charge in the annual return of income. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iii) The Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice No.PRA/AM/61/2205/ dated March 12, 2014 to Faysal Asset Management Limited requiring the Subsidiary Company to obtain registration / enrolment and to pay sales tax amounting to Rs. 6.055 million from July 2013 to March 2014 under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 with effect from May 22, 2013 on management fee earned in Punjab.

In respect of this, the Subsidiary Company, jointly with other Asset Management Companies together with their respective collective investment schemes through their trustees, has filed a petition on July 8, 2014 in the SHC challenging the above notice. The Court has ordered suspension of the show cause notice till the next hearing of appeal in their order dated July 10, 2014. The next date of hearing has not yet been decided. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iv) During the prior period, the audit of the tax year 2013 (financial year ended June 30, 2013) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 4.964 million for the tax year 2013 on account of apportionment of expenses, salary expenses and hardware and software expense. The management filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. The CIR(A) remanded back a few expenses while ordered against various other expenses for which the Subsidiary Company has decided to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(v) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.673 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.


(vi) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) has passed an order under section 182(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax year 2018, whereby the DCIR has imposed a penalty of Rs. 0.833 million on account of non submission of statement required to be filed by the Subsidiary Company under bilateral or multilateral convention under section 165B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The management has filed an appeal before the CIR(A) on the subject matter and has paid an amount of Rs 0.083 million being 10% of the total amount of penalty imposed under the order and has thus obtained an automatic stay on the subject matter. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the matter will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision in respect of this penalty has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

## Chunk 163

# Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

| Forward foreign exchange contracts | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties.

| Fixed assets (land and building)                      | Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31 2021. |
| Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31 2021.                 |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
