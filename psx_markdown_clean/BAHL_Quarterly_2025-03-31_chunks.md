DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

It is our pleasure to present the un-audited financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited along with the un-audited consolidated financial statements of Bank AL Habib Limited and the Bankʼs Subsidiaries AL Habib Capital Markets (Private) Limited, AL Habib Asset Management Limited, and AL Habib Exchange Company (Private) Limited for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

Alhamdolillah, during the period under review, the performance of the Bank continued to be satisfactory. The deposits increased to Rs. 2.38 trillion as compared to Rs. 2.28 trillion on December 31, 2024. In the same period, advances increased to Rs. 947.2 billion from Rs. 910.9 billion, while investments increased to Rs. 1.97 trillion from Rs. 1.92 trillion. The pre-tax profit of the Bank for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was Rs. 20.60 billion as compared to Rs. 19.23 billion during the corresponding period last year. The profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was Rs. 10.21 billion compared with Rs. 10.03 billion during 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on April 24, 2025, has declared 1st interim cash dividend of Rs. 3.50 per share i.e. 35% for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

By the Grace of Allah, the Bank now has a network of 1,242 offices, comprising 1,224 branches, 14 sub-branches, and 4 Representative Offices. Our branch network includes 293 Islamic Banking Branches and 2 Overseas Branches. Continuing with our branch expansion policy, the Bank intends to open more branches during the year 2025.

Alhamdolillah, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited (PACRA) has maintained the Bank's long term entity and short term entity ratings at AAA (Triple A) and A1+ (A One plus), respectively. This long term credit rating AAA (Triple A) denotes the highest credit quality with the lowest expectation of credit risk, and indicates exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.

The ratings of our unsecured, subordinated Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) are AAA (Triple A) for TFC-2021 and TFC-2022, and AA+ (Double A plus) for TFC-2017 (perpetual) and TFC-2022 (perpetual). These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk emanating from a very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. Further, the TFC-2022 & the TFC-2022 (perpetual) issued in 2022, were listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pursuant to Chapter 5C of PSX Rule Book.

We wish to thank our customers, for their continued trust and support, local & foreign correspondents for their confidence and cooperation, and the State Bank of Pakistan for their guidance. We also thank all our staff members for their sincerity, dedication, and hard work.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing includes purchase of goods by banks from customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate mark-up in price on deferred payment basis. The purchase and resale arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such, but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of mark-up thereon. However, the Islamic Banking branches of the Bank have complied with the requirements set out under the Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2017.

# Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

# Level 3:

Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 40.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division is accepting the deposits and maintaining Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharaka, Running Musharaka, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The net income loss is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was December of net income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was December 2024: 50% of net income.

After the allocation of Income between Mudarib (Bank) and Depositors (Rab ul Maal) the profit is distributed among the depositors on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing, credit loss allowance under IFRS-9 and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

87

# Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

# Level 1:

Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

# Level 2:

Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

---

## Chunk 201

# Level 3:

Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period / year.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 41.8.3 Parameters used for allocation of profit, charging expenses and provisions etc. along with a brief description of their major components

The Bank’s Islamic Banking Division (IBD) is accepting Term Deposits and Saving Deposits under Mudaraba arrangements, wherein the Bank is Mudarib and depositors are Rab-Ul-Maal. The Bank with the prior approval of Depositors also commingles its funds with those of depositors.

The funds so generated are invested by the Bank in Shariah compliant modes of financing and investments such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna, Diminishing Musharaka, Running Musharaka, Musawama, Shares, Mutual Funds and Sukuks etc.

The Bank calculates the profit of the pool every month. Profit is distributed at the Net Income level. Net Income is calculated after deducting direct costs such as cost of Murabaha, cost of Takaful, Depreciation on Ijarah Assets, and amortization of premium on sukuks and loss of investments directly incurred in deriving that Income.

The Net income (loss) is being allocated between the Bank’s equity and the depositors’ fund in proportion to their respective share in pool.

The Bank’s profit sharing ratio during the quarter was 0 (December 2024) of Net Income and the depositors’ profit sharing ratio was 0 (December 2024: 50%) of net income.

After the allocation of Income between Mudarib (Bank) and Depositors (Rab ul Maal) the profit is distributed among the depositors on the basis of predetermined weightages, announced by the Bank at the beginning of the month based on their respective category / tiers. In case of loss, Rab-ul-Maal has to bear the loss in the ratio of its investment.

In case of provisioning, the general and specific provisions created against non-performing financing, credit loss allowance under IFRS-9 and diminution in the value of investments as under prudential regulations and other SBP directives shall be borne by the IBIs as Mudarib. However, write-offs of financings and loss on sale of investments shall be charged to the pool along with other direct expenses.
