# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Pakistan has become the latest affectee of climate change as devastating floods, caused by melting glaciers and unprecedented rainfall, battered vast swathes of land, inundating nearly a third of the country. The damage from the floods has been estimated by the IFIs and the UN at around $32.4 billion, 11% of GDP. For now, the focus is on rescue and relief efforts, with rehabilitation likely to last much longer. While there is global recognition and sympathy that the impact of climate change on Pakistan dwarfs the country’s contribution to the problem, tangible support has been somewhat underwhelming.

Even before the floods, contractionary policies had triggered a correction in economic indicators as demand management efforts took root. After posting a growth of 11.7% in FY’22, the Large-Scale Manufacturing Index for 2MFY’23 has declined by 0.4% YoY, its first decline in 2 years. Meanwhile, the necessary removal of fuel and electricity subsidies, global commodity price increases and food price volatility have stoked inflation to its highest level in 15 years. Headline inflation took a dip in September, due to deferral of the fuel charge adjustment, but averaged 25.1% for Q1FY’23 compared to 8.6% in Q1FY’22.

Pro-growth policies fuelled by energy subsidies had heightened the current account deficit in FY’22 to USD 17.3 billion (~4.6% of GDP). Since then, fiscal and monetary tightening, and curbing of non-essential imports have combined to contain imports, which declined by 8% in Q1FY’23. On the upside, exports grew by 5.5%, narrowing the trade deficit by 17% YoY, to USD 8.4 billion. Remittances for Q1’FY23 declined by 6% over Q1FY’22, but nevertheless maintained a healthy monthly level of ~USD 2.5 billion. However, the greatly improved trade balance reflected in a strong reduction in the current account deficit, which contracted by 37.4%, to USD 2.2 billion.

External debt repayments and delays in the IMF agreement led to foreign exchange reserves depleting precariously, by nearly 60% from December 2021. The release of the EFF tranche of ~USD 1.16 billion provided only a brief respite with SBP reserves less than USD 8 billion as of end-September. Concerns about the external account and debt financing have also led to elevated yields on Pakistan’s Eurobonds, ahead of the December 2022 maturity. The currency remained under sustained pressure from the weak external position, political noise and the floods, further exacerbated by global monetary tightening. As a result, the Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to historic lows, crossing Rs 240/$ before a rally, spurred by the appointment of the new Finance Minister, led to some retracement. Even then, by the end of Q1FY’23, the Rupee had devalued by an unprecedented Rs 24/USD (11.5%) in one quarter alone.

The equity market continued a volatile year as the multitude of stresses – macroeconomic pressures, political uncertainty, rate increases by major central banks, and the Rupee trajectory – weighed negatively on investors. The benchmark index has remained choppy and range-bound, ending the quarter at 8.4% below the December 2021 level.

In its recent monetary policy, the SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 15%, advocating striking a balance between taming inflation and supporting growth, especially in the wake of the floods. The SBP also noted that the economy had slowed considerably, indicating that tightening measures were gaining traction. With both upside and downside risks possible, and the impact of the floods yet to be quantified, the central bank considered it prudent to adopt a status quo position. Industry advances for the first nine months of 2022 have increased by nearly 10% while deposits have grown by 8.8% during the same period. The increases in policy rate are now beginning to be manifested in banking spreads which have increased by 43 bps for 8M’22 compared to 8M’21.

## Chunk 5

# Financial Performance

HBL’s consolidated profit before tax of Rs 55.6 billion for the first nine months of 2022 has increased by 20% over the same period last year. This was led by another strong performance from the domestic franchise – delivering on all key activity drivers – complemented by the return to profitability of the international business and higher returns from all subsidiaries.

The Bank’s profit after tax, however, declined by 12% to Rs 23.6 billion because of a higher and excessive tax charge applied in the Federal Budget, which included retrospective application. Consequently, earnings per share reduced to Rs 15.95 in 9M’22 from Rs 18.21 in 9M’21.

HBL’s balance sheet grew by 5% to Rs 4.5 trillion with total deposits at Rs 3.4 trillion. Domestic low-cost deposits increased by Rs 214 billion and the mix of current accounts reached nearly 40%. HBL remains committed to supporting its customers and the economic growth of the country, particularly in these challenging economic times. Advances increased by 14% over December 2021, to Rs 1.7 trillion, with broad-based double-digit growth across all customer segments. Corporate lending remains the leading driver; the Consumer business grew by 17% to Rs 120 billion while Commercial lending achieved a key milestone, crossing Rs 100 billion. Agriculture lending, where HBL remains dominant, reached a new all-time high of Rs 45 billion. The lending momentum in HBL Microfinance continues unabated, underlining the Bank’s progress on its financial inclusion initiatives; advances increased by 36% over December 2021 to Rs 77 billion including an agriculture portfolio of Rs 40 billion.



HBL Q ART RLY RE PORT 05 SE PT MBE R 30, 2022

With lagged asset repricing now taking effect, spreads widened as expected. Along with a Rs 564 billion growth in the average balance sheet, net interest income of the Bank grew 19% to Rs 116 billion. The growth trajectory of non-fund income continued, with fees increasing by 27% over 9M’21 to Rs 22.8 billion. The growth in fees was led by another stellar performance from HBL’s flagship Cards business supported by double-digit increases in contributions from consumer finance, trade and branchless banking. Consequently, total revenue of the Bank has increased by 23% over the same period last year, to Rs 151.7 billion.

HBL continued to invest in its people and in its digital journey. HBL’s administrative expenses (excluding the one-off Voluntary Separation Scheme in H1’22) increased by 26% over the nine months of last year. The Rupee devaluation alone caused an increase of Rs 3.6 billion in the expense base. 15-year high inflation, higher variable transaction-driven costs, spiralling fuel and utilities costs all contributed to the elevated expenses. Total provisions for 9M’22 have reduced by 35% over the previous year to Rs 3.6 billion, with the charge mainly emanating from general provisioning. The infection ratio remained flat at an all-time low of 5.1%, with total coverage at over 100%.

# Capital Ratios

HBL’s robust results for 9M’22 have led to strong internal capital generation which, under normal circumstances, would lead to a continuous improvement in the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), despite the Bank’s focus on lending growth. However, the CAR continues to be impacted by the Rupee devaluation. In Q3’22 alone, the devaluation of Rs 24/$ eroded Tier 1 CAR by 47 bps. The Bank’s efforts to optimize its balance sheet and risk-weighted assets added 26 bps, to somewhat offset the impact of the devaluation.

HBL’s total consolidated Tier 1 CAR at Sep’22 was 11.3% with Total CAR at 14.3%.

## Chunk 8

# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, Capital Intelligence (CI), an international rating agency, reaffirmed the Bank’s long-term and short-term foreign currency ratings at B- and B respectively. HBL’s Bank Standalone Rating of b- and Core Financial Strength (CFS) rating of bb- were also re-affirmed. CI noted that the CFS was supported by the Bank’s diversified and stable funding profile, sound liquidity ratios and leading market positions in nearly all areas. The Outlook was changed from Stable to Negative, based on CI’s view of heightened sovereign risk and Pakistan’s external vulnerabilities.

Moody’s also downgraded their country rating of Pakistan from B3 to Caa1 and subsequently lowered their ratings of HBL (along with other leading banks) to Caa1 in line with the sovereign.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on October 26, 2022, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 1.50 per share (15%) for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This is in addition to the interim dividends of Rs 3.75/share that have been declared and paid for the first two quarters of 2022.

## Chunk 10

# Future Outlook

With inflation soaring to levels not seen in this century, global financial markets are in continued turmoil. A low interest rate environment, coupled with heavy government stimulus and bailouts during COVID distorted consumer spending patterns and induced excess demand at a time when supply chains were frozen. Furthermore, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalating and recent OPEC+ actions, volatility in the world oil market is expected to continue, casting an overhang on Pakistan’s economy, which is reeling from its worst-ever floods. While headline inflation has moderated in September, core and food inflation both increased. The SBP expects higher food prices to elevate average headline inflation above pre-flood projections of 18-20%, while GDP growth is projected to fall below 2% in FY’23.

The recent removal of the country from the FATF’s grey list is a major achievement, especially in the evolving geopolitical order. This represents an opportunity for Pakistan to change the global narrative on the country and should be seized. It demonstrates, and provides a stark reminder of, the benefits of policy continuity despite changes in government. It also provides a road map of how consistency in policies can and should be prioritized in areas like economic development and structural reform, through a Charter of Economy that can be agreed across the political spectrum. The Government must ensure continuity of the EFF, in particular, the structural reforms that have been agreed and strive towards widening the tax net rather than taxing the already-taxed, so that an equitable system is established. Timely repayment of the December Eurobond maturity will also go a long way in calming jittery markets and re-establishing the country’s credibility.

HBL has stayed the course with its strategic focus on people, processes and technology, reflected in a record quarter. HBL has helped ease the financial pressure on many of its employees by giving them additional support through this difficult economic period. Recently, recognising the ability of people to contribute much longer than in the past, HBL raised its retirement age to 65 years. This unprecedented initiative has been widely applauded internally and acclaimed across Corporate Pakistan. Once again, at a time of crisis with the devastating floods, HBL has stepped up by contributing and delivering rations, tents and mosquito nets to thousands of affected families; our people have gone to extraordinary lengths, delivering Government subsidies to inaccessible areas at personal risk.

HBL has entrenched its position as a thought leader in all sectors of the economy – from ESG leadership, to being the Government’s provider of choice for social payments, to being the key sponsor of national inclusion initiatives. We are extremely proud of our publicly acknowledged role in helping the country exit the FATF grey list, underlining our own pioneering initiatives on this front. As Pakistan’s pre-eminent financial institution, HBL, as always, stands ready and willing to support the nation and its people in all their endeavours.

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

# For the nine months ended September 30, 2022

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

## Chunk 86

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities - The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities - Investment in non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Investments in non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Foreign Government debt securities - The fair values of foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Units of mutual funds - The fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.

Derivatives - The Group enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions - The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims - Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# DIRECTORS’ REVIEW

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Pakistan has become the latest affectee of climate change as devastating floods, caused by melting glaciers and unprecedented rainfall, battered vast swathes of land, inundating nearly a third of the country. The damage from the floods has been estimated by the IFIs and the UN at around $32.4 billion, 11% of GDP. For now, the focus is on rescue and relief efforts, with rehabilitation likely to last much longer. While there is global recognition and sympathy that the impact of climate change on Pakistan dwarfs the country’s contribution to the problem, tangible support has been somewhat underwhelming.

Even before the floods, contractionary policies had triggered a correction in economic indicators as demand management efforts took root. After posting a growth of 11.7% in FY’22, the Large-Scale Manufacturing Index for 2MFY’23 has declined by 0.4% YoY, its first decline in 2 years. Meanwhile, the necessary removal of fuel and electricity subsidies, global commodity price increases and food price volatility have stoked inflation to its highest level in 15 years. Headline inflation took a dip in September, due to deferral of the fuel charge adjustment, but averaged 25.1% for Q1FY’23 compared to 8.6% in Q1FY’22.

Pro-growth policies fuelled by energy subsidies had heightened the current account deficit in FY’22 to USD 17.3 billion (~4.6% of GDP). Since then, fiscal and monetary tightening, and curbing of non-essential imports have combined to contain imports, which declined by 8% in Q1FY’23. On the upside, exports grew by 5.5%, narrowing the trade deficit by 17% YoY, to USD 8.4 billion. Remittances for Q1’FY23 declined by 6% over Q1FY’22, but nevertheless maintained a healthy monthly level of ~USD 2.5 billion. However, the greatly improved trade balance reflected in a strong reduction in the current account deficit, which contracted by 37.4%, to USD 2.2 billion.

External debt repayments and delays in the IMF agreement led to foreign exchange reserves depleting precariously, by nearly 60% from December 2021. The release of the EFF tranche of ~USD 1.16 billion provided only a brief respite with SBP reserves less than USD 8 billion as of end-September. Concerns about the external account and debt financing have also led to elevated yields on Pakistan’s Eurobonds, ahead of the December 2022 maturity. The currency remained under sustained pressure from the weak external position, political noise and the floods, further exacerbated by global monetary tightening. As a result, the Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to historic lows, crossing Rs 240/$ before a rally, spurred by the appointment of the new Finance Minister, led to some retracement. Even then, by the end of Q1FY’23, the Rupee had devalued by an unprecedented Rs 24/USD (11.5%) in one quarter alone.

The equity market continued a volatile year as the multitude of stresses – macroeconomic pressures, political uncertainty, rate increases by major central banks, and the Rupee trajectory – weighed negatively on investors. The benchmark index has remained choppy and range-bound, ending the quarter at 8.4% below the December 2021 level.

In its recent monetary policy, the SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 15%, advocating striking a balance between taming inflation and supporting growth, especially in the wake of the floods. The SBP also noted that the economy had slowed considerably, indicating that tightening measures were gaining traction. With both upside and downside risks possible, and the impact of the floods yet to be quantified, the central bank considered it prudent to adopt a status quo position. Industry advances for the first nine months of 2022 have increased by nearly 10% while deposits have grown by 8.8% during the same period. The increases in policy rate are now beginning to be manifested in banking spreads which have increased by 43 bps for 8M’22 compared to 8M’21.

# Financial Performance

HBL’s Unconsolidated profit before tax of Rs 51.5 billion for the first nine months of 2022 has increased by 14% over the same period last year. This was led by another strong performance from the domestic franchise – delivering on all key activity drivers – complemented by the return to profitability of the international business. The Bank’s profit after tax, however, declined by 18% to Rs 21.7 billion because of a higher and excessive tax charge applied in the Federal Budget, which included retrospective application. Consequently, earnings per share reduced to Rs 14.79 in 9M’22 from Rs 18.03 in 9M’21.

HBL’s balance sheet grew by 4% to Rs 4.3 trillion with total deposits at Rs 3.2 trillion. Domestic low-cost deposits increased by Rs 214 billion and the mix of current accounts reached nearly 40%. HBL remains committed to supporting its customers and the economic growth of the country, particularly in these challenging economic times. Advances increased by 13% over December 2021 to Rs 1.6 trillion, with broad-based double-digit growth across all customer segments. Corporate lending remains the leading driver; the Consumer business grew by 17% to Rs 120 billion while Commercial lending achieved a key milestone, crossing Rs 100 billion. Agriculture lending, where HBL remains dominant, reached a new all-time high of Rs 45 billion.

With lagged asset repricing now taking effect, spreads widened as expected. Along with a Rs 521 billion growth in the average balance sheet, net interest income of the Bank grew 19% to Rs 107 billion. The growth trajectory of non-fund income continued, with fees increasing by 28% over 9M’21 to Rs 20 billion. The growth in fees was led by another stellar performance from HBL’s flagship Cards business supported by double-digit increases in contributions from consumer finance, trade and branchless banking. Consequently, total revenue of the Bank has increased by 21% over the same period last year, to Rs 135.8 billion.

HBL continued to invest in its people and in its digital journey. HBL’s administrative expenses (excluding the one-off Voluntary Separation Scheme in H1’22) increased by 25% over the nine months of last year. The Rupee devaluation alone caused an increase of Rs 2.8 billion in the expense base. 15-year high inflation, higher variable transaction-driven costs, spiralling fuel and utilities costs all contributed to the elevated expenses. Total provisions for 9M’22 have reduced by 40% over the previous year to Rs 2.4 billion, with the charge mainly emanating from general provisioning. The infection ratio remained flat at an all-time low of 5.2%, with total coverage at over 102%.

# Capital Ratios

HBL’s robust results for 9M’22 have led to strong internal capital generation which, under normal circumstances, would lead to a continuous improvement in the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), despite the Bank’s focus on lending growth. However, the CAR continues to be impacted by the Rupee devaluation. In Q3’22 alone, the devaluation of Rs 24/$ eroded Tier 1 CAR by 42 bps. The Bank’s efforts to optimize its balance sheet and risk-weighted assets added 29 bps to somewhat offset the impact of the devaluation.

HBL’s total unconsolidated Tier 1 CAR at Sep’22 was 12.3% with Total CAR at 14.9%.

# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, Capital Intelligence (CI), an international rating agency, reaffirmed the Bank’s long-term and short-term foreign currency ratings at B- and B respectively. HBL’s Bank Standalone Rating of b- and Core Financial Strength (CFS) rating of bb- were also re-affirmed. CI noted that the CFS was supported by the Bank’s diversified and stable funding profile, sound liquidity ratios and leading market positions in nearly all areas. The Outlook was changed from Stable to Negative, based on CI’s view of heightened sovereign risk and Pakistan’s external vulnerabilities.

Moody’s also downgraded their country rating of Pakistan from B3 to Caa1 and subsequently lowered their ratings of HBL (along with other leading banks) to Caa1 in line with the sovereign.

# Future Outlook

With inflation soaring to levels not seen in this century, global financial markets are in continued turmoil. A low interest rate environment, coupled with heavy government stimulus and bailouts during COVID distorted consumer spending patterns and induced excess demand at a time when supply chains were frozen. Furthermore, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalating and recent OPEC+ actions, volatility in the world oil market is expected to continue, casting an overhang on Pakistan’s economy, which is reeling from its worst-ever floods. While headline inflation has moderated in September, core and food inflation both increased. The SBP expects higher food prices to elevate average headline inflation above pre-flood projections of 18-20%, while GDP growth is projected to fall below 2% in FY’23.

The recent removal of the country from the FATF’s grey list is a major achievement, especially in the evolving geopolitical order. This represents an opportunity for Pakistan to change the global narrative on the country and should be seized. It demonstrates, and provides a stark reminder of, the benefits of policy continuity despite changes in government. It also provides a road map of how consistency in policies can and should be prioritized in areas like economic development and structural reform, through a Charter of Economy that can be agreed across the political spectrum. The Government must ensure continuity of the EFF, in particular, the structural reforms that have been agreed and strive towards widening the tax net rather than taxing the already-taxed, so that an equitable system is established. Timely repayment of the December Eurobond maturity will also go a long way in calming jittery markets and re-establishing the country’s credibility.

HBL has stayed the course with its strategic focus on people, processes and technology, reflected in a record quarter. HBL has helped ease the financial pressure on many of its employees by giving them additional support through this difficult economic period. Recently, recognising the ability of people to contribute much longer than in the past, HBL raised its retirement age to 65 years. This unprecedented initiative has been widely applauded internally and acclaimed across Corporate Pakistan. Once again, at a time of crisis with the devastating floods, HBL has stepped up by contributing and delivering rations, tents and mosquito nets to thousands of affected families; our people have gone to extraordinary lengths, delivering Government subsidies to inaccessible areas at personal risk.

HBL has entrenched its position as a thought leader in all sectors of the economy – from ESG leadership, to being the Government’s provider of choice for social payments, to being the key sponsor of national inclusion initiatives. We are extremely proud of our publicly acknowledged role in helping the country exit the FATF grey list, underlining our own pioneering initiatives on this front. As Pakistan’s pre-eminent financial institution, HBL, as always, stands ready and willing to support the nation and its people in all their endeavours.

# 2.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The basis for accounting estimates adopted in the preparation of these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements is the same as that applied in the preparation of the unconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, except the following:

During the period, the Bank has reviewed the useful life of Point of Sale (POS) terminals which has resulted in a change in the Bank's estimate of the useful life of these terminals from 3 years to 4 years. This revision has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 and accordingly, has been recognised prospectively in the unconsolidated profit and loss account from the current year.

The effect of this change on depreciation expense in the current period and the next corresponding period is as follows:

|                  | September 30, 2023                                         | September 30, 2022 |        |

# 32 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities Investment in non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Investments in non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Foreign Government debt securities The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Units of mutual funds The fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.

Derivatives The Bank enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.
