With strong build up in core earnings, MCB's Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the first quarter of 2022 rose to Rs 14.9 billion with impressive growth of 32%. Profit After Tax (PAT) posted a growth of 31% to reach Rs. 8.9 billion; translating into Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 7.52 compared to EPS of Rs. 5.73 reported in corresponding period last year.

On the back of strong volumetric growth in current account, net interest income for 1Q'22 increased by 19% over corresponding period last year. Working on a well-defined strategy, the average current deposits of the Bank registered a growth of Rs 71.3 billion (+14%), when mapped against corresponding period last year.

Non-markup income registered a growth of 20% and aggregated to Rs. 5.72 billion against Rs. 4.75 billion in the corresponding period last year. The growth is mainly attributable to rise in foreign exchange and dividend income by 94% and 81% respectively; on the back of prudent positioning of foreign exchange assets and liabilities amidst comparatively favorable swap curves and resurging economic activity within the country.

The Bank continues to prudently manage its operating expenses with a moderate increase of 9%, despite sustained inflationary pressures amid currency devaluation and rising commodity prices, higher compliance related regulatory charges, expansion in branch outreach and regular performance and merit adjustments of the Human Capital. Thus the cost to income ratio of the Bank significantly improved to 39.90% from 43.50% reported in same period last year.

On the provision front, disposal of equity scrips resulted in a net reversal of Rs. 187 million recognized during the period under review while proactive monitoring and recovery efforts led to a reversal of Rs. 616 million in provision against advances. Persistent focus on maintaining a robust risk management framework encompassing structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk. The Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 51.34 billion. The Bank has not taken FSV benefit in calculation of specific provision against its non-performing loans (NPL's) base. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 87.91% and 8.14% respectively.

On the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank grew by 6% to cross the “Two Trillion” landmark and was reported at Rs. 2,095 billion; the major contribution coming from the investment book which increased by Rs. 143 billion (+14%). While the gross advances registered a slight decline of Rs. 5 billion (-1%), the consumer lending book grew by leveraging significant activity in the construction and auto segment and consequently added Rs. 2.8 billion in the first quarter (+7%).

On the liabilities side, achieving growth in no-cost current account base remained a key strategic objective for the Bank. Thereby, non-remunerative deposits grew by 14% to close at Rs. 640 billion; improving their mix in the total deposits to 43% in absolute terms as at March 31, 2022. CASA mix was reported at an industry leading level of 92.87% which in turn is a reflection of customer loyalty earned by the Bank over a rich history of 75 years through sustained provision of quality services. The total deposits of the Bank grew by 5.65% as compared to an industry decline of 2.37% (domestic deposits) to close the period at Rs. 1,492 billion.

Return on Assets and Return on Equity improved to 1.75% and 22.14% respectively, whereas the book value per share was reported at Rs. 136.66. During the period under review, MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 823 million to further consolidate its position as an active participant in SBP's cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels. The inflow by MCB till March 31, 2022 under the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) initiative has stood at USD 282 million. Under “Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar” initiative, till March 31, 2022, the Bank has disbursed 841 loans of Rs. 3.4 billion.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is 16.35% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank's Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 14.92% against the requirement of 6%. Bank's capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 6.05% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 236.59% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 154.24% against requirement of 100%.

The Board of Directors has declared the first interim cash dividend of Rs. 5.0 per share i.e. 50% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.

# Economy Review

During the first quarter of the calendar year 2022, Pakistan's economy faced several challenges including global commodity prices and high inflation. Domestic energy and metal prices rose significantly in line with the global trends. This caused domestic inflation to increase to a multi-year high in the first quarter. Some moderation in domestic aggregate demand is expected as a result of policy rate hikes by the State Bank of Pakistan. However, the global geopolitical complexity and recent political uncertainty at home is expected to add to the exchange rate depreciation and price pressures in the coming months. The headline annual inflation rate in Pakistan rose to 12.7% in Mar-22 from 12.28% inflation in Dec-21. Despite the recent fuel and electricity subsidies, the annual inflation remained well above 12% in the first three months. The increase in monthly inflation indicates strong momentum of price hikes in the economy. The average annual inflation for this fiscal year (Jul-21 to Mar-22) increased to 10.77%. Consistent rise in international commodity prices, pre-Ramadan food price hikes, and rising input costs of manufacturers contributed to the strong domestic inflation.

## Chunk 5


# Current Economic Overview

On the external front, pressures started to build on the country's exchange rate and external account due to expensive energy and commodity imports. Pakistan recorded the highest-ever current account deficit of USD 2.531 billion in Jan-22. The current account deficit reached USD 12.09 billion for the first eight months of this fiscal year as compared to a deficit of USD 1.916 billion in the fiscal year 2021.

Higher volumes and rising prices of imported goods and services caused the import bill to expand at a much faster pace than exports in this fiscal year. As a result, the USD/PKR exchange rate also depreciated by 3.94% from 176.5135 to 183.4782 in the first quarter. Current account deficit and external debt repayments caused Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves to decrease by around 27% from USD 23.88 billion to USD 17.47 billion during the first quarter. To support the Balance of Payments, Pakistan issued USD 1 billion of international Sukuk in Feb-22. Moreover, the country received USD 1 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the same month.

The State Bank of Pakistan raised the policy rate cumulatively by 2.75% to 9.75% by the end of the last year to achieve sustainable economic growth and moderate inflation in the economy. The State Bank of Pakistan, in its emergency meeting held on April 07, 2022 raised the policy rate by 2.50% to 12.25%. Average inflation forecasts have been revised upwards to slightly above 11% in FY22 before moderating in FY23.

On the fiscal side, the government raised its tax revenue target from Rs 5.83 trillion to Rs 6.1 trillion to meet the IMF conditions. From Jul-21 to Mar-22, the Federal Board of Revenue has collected net tax revenue of Rs 4.382 trillion, representing a growth of about 29% as compared to the same period a year ago. The government has lowered the budgeted number of Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) spending from Rs 900 billion to Rs 700 billion for the current fiscal year.

## Chunk 6


# Future Outlook

Pakistan continues to face macroeconomic challenges mainly due to expensive commodity imports and domestic political uncertainty. These challenges will likely continue to add to inflation and the external account problems in the economy. High inflation, policy rate hikes by SBP, and lower PSDP spending will likely moderate growth in domestic aggregate demand. However, inflation is unlikely to come down in the near term as global commodity prices are expected to remain elevated for a longer time. The IMF and the Pakistani authorities have initiated talks for the seventh review of EFF, which will result in the disbursement of around USD 960 million to Pakistan.

3.2 The State Bank of Pakistan has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standards 40, 'Investment Property' for Banking Companies through BSD Circular No. 10 dated August 26, 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has deferred applicability of IFRS-7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" on banks through S.R.O 411(1) /2008 dated April 28, 2008. Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. However, investments have been classified and valued in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the State Bank of Pakistan through various circulars.

3.3 The SECP vide its notification SRO 633 (I)/2014 dated 10 July 2014, adopted IFRS 10 effective from the periods starting from June 30, 2014.

## Chunk 16


# For The Three Months Period Ended March 31, 2022

# 3.6 Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

The following new standards and amendments to existing accounting standards will be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standard or amendment:

| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1                          | January 1, 2024 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Amended Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8                                       | January 1, 2023 |
| Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – Amendment to IAS 12 | January 1, 2023 |

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

IFRS 9 is effective from January 01, 2022 as per BPRD Circular letter No. 24 of 2021 dated July 05, 2021 of SBP. However, final Implementation guidelines from SBP for consistent application of IFRS 9 across the banking industry are awaited. Therefore these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime. However, the requirements of this standard are incorporated in these unconsolidated financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

There are other new and amended standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the Bank's accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 but are considered not to be relevant or do not have any significant effect on the Bank's operations and are therefore not detailed in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

20.1 Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Bank maintained its provision in respect of WWF. 21.1 Under IFRS-3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income. However, the amount of bargain purchase gain was not been taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Bank, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions/deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR. 21.2 Statutory reserve represents amount set aside as per the requirements of section 21 of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.

# 35. Fair Value Measurements

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'held to maturity'. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available financial statements.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Bank's accounting policy.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

# 35.1 Fair Value of Financial Assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

| Operating fixed assets (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these unconsolidated financial statements. |

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates (the "Group").

a. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based in the financial statements for the three months period ended March 31, 2022 and the carrying value of investments held by the parent is eliminated against the subsidiaries' shareholders' equity in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. Material intra-Group balances and transactions have been eliminated.

b. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter adjusted for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Group's share in associates have been accounted for based on the financial statements for the three months period ended March 31, 2022.

c. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

# 3.6

Standards, interpretations of and amendments to approved accounting standards that are not yet effective

The following new standards and amendments to existing accounting standards will be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standard or amendment:

| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1                          | January 1, 2024 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Amended Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8                                       | January 1, 2023 |
| Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – Amendment to IAS 12 | January 1, 2023 |

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk. IFRS 9 is effective from January 01, 2022 as per BPRD Circular letter No. 24 of 2021 dated July 05, 2021 of SBP. However, final Implementation guidelines from SBP for consistent application of IFRS 9 across the banking industry are awaited. Therefore these consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the existing prudential regime. However, the requirements of this standard are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

20.1 Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Group maintained its provision in respect of WWF.

# 23.4 Taxation

For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2021, the tax department disputed Group's treatment on certain issues, where the Group's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs.3,857 million (2021: Rs. 1,497 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance / deducted at source.

The Group has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Group are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Group's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# 35. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Group essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building.

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Group as 'held to maturity'. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortised cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available financial statements.

Fair value of fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of loans and advances has been calculated in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
