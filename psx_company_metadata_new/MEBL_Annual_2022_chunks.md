# This is a photograph of a calligraphic painting in the Board room of Meezan Bank’s Head office.

As the idea of setting up Pakistan's first Islamic bank was taking shape, the name "Meezan" was handpicked from the Holy Quran by Dr. Ghazala Siddiqui, wife of Founding President & CEO, Mr. Irfan Siddiqui.

The word "Meezan" carries great significance in Islam and appears several times in Surah Ar Rahman, known to be one of the most beautiful surahs of the Quran. It represents the principles of balance and justice that are central to the natural world, as well as human affairs.

Within the realm of Islamic finance, "Meezan" embodies the ideals of financial justice and fairness that are at the core of Shariah-compliant banking.

By Allah's grace, Meezan has now grown into one of the most recognised and reputable brands in the country. Through this brand, Meezan Bank reaffirms its commitment to upholding its Values, and providing pragmatic and excellence-driven solutions to those seeking financial services without compromising their faith. It serves as a reminder to always strive towards balance and justice in all aspects of life, and to promote the greater good for all.

CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW

Alhamdulillah, it gives me immense pleasure to present to you the Annual Report of Meezan Bank for 2022. This is also the year which celebrates completion of the Bank’s first 25 years since its establishment as an Investment Bank in 1997, and during this time, Meezan Bank has grown from its humble beginnings, to its current position of being one of the top five banks in Pakistan. As a Board Member and now as Chairman, I have had the privilege of witnessing this journey from the front seat, and it has been nothing short of breathtaking to see the Bank grow into the institution it is today.

Meezan Bank has been a pioneer in the establishment of Islamic banking in Pakistan and we are humbled to have led this initiative. The success of Meezan Bank is a testament to the blessings of Allah (SWT) and the dedication and hard work of our team.

04 Meezan Bank Annual Report 2022




Meezan Bank Annual Report 2022


By the grace of Allah (SWT), this has been an exciting journey of success and fulfilment. Meezan Bank has been a pioneer in the establishment of Islamic banking in Pakistan and we are humbled to have led this initiative. The success of Meezan Bank is a testament to the blessings of Allah (SWT) and the dedication and hard work of our team.

The local and international acclaims that the Bank has received are outstanding. It has won the Global award for 'Best Islamic Retail Bank' this year by Islamic Finance News (IFN), Malaysia, in addition to winning all the six country-level awards for Pakistan conferred by IFN. Meezan Bank was also the recipient of ‘Best Consumer Bank for 2022’ from Pakistan Banking Awards and the 'Best Bank of the Year – Large Size Banks' award by the CFA Society of Pakistan, which the Bank has won for the third year in a row, as well as ‘Best Islamic Bank of the Year’ and 'Best Digital Banking Services Award of the Year' – 2021. It is great to see the Bank achieve such successes and I pray that Insha’Allah the Bank continues to grow and be recognized for its achievements.

Since its inception, Meezan Bank has been at the forefront of the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan, and our unwavering focus on providing exceptional customer service has been integral to our success. We remain dedicated to our Vision of establishing ‘Islamic banking as banking of first choice…’ and the best way to achieve this, in addition to growing our branch network, is by focusing on increasing financial inclusion and using technology to enable people to conduct their banking transactions ‘on the go’. Financial inclusion is an important goal of both the Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan and we are committed to supporting this initiative. Despite the current challenges, we are optimistic about the progress of Pakistan's economy and are committed to contributing to its growth.

After the pandemic, this was the first full year when the Bank operated in an environment not dampened by the COVID-19 related restrictions. I am pleased to see that the measures the Bank took during the pandemic period such as keeping almost its entire branch network open and even working extended hours to facilitate customers, giving special attention to maintaining branch service levels, promoting an effective work-from-home domain and strengthening its systems to manage the increased levels of digital transactions, have all borne fruits in the form of both enhancing operational efficiency as well as strengthening customers’ confidence and loyalty – and these are accruing long-term benefits for the organization.

Alhamdulillah, the Bank achieved one of the highest growths in profitability in the country’s banking sector this year. The Bank’s Profit After Tax increased by 60% over the previous year with return on equity of over 40%. Also, with market cap of Rs 178 billion, Meezan Bank remained the most valuable bank in Pakistan amongst all the listed banks.

Being cognizant of the United Nations Environmental Social Governance Framework, the Bank, in addition to actively extending solar financing to reduce the carbon footprint in the economy, has also taken the initiative to provide solar energy installations to various public interest organizations as a CSR initiative.

Meezan Bank continues to actively support the State Bank-led initiatives such as Prime Minister’s Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme, Islamic SME Asaan Finance (ISAAF), Roshan Apna Ghar and Roshan Apni Car for Non-Resident Pakistanis.

I would like to commend the Meezan Family on the following key highlights of the Bank in 2022:

- The financing portfolio crossing the one trillion Rupee milestone for the first time.
- Crossing the two trillion Rupee mark in Trade Finance (Import and Export)

I am also happy to see the Bank's success in facilitating customers through alternate distribution channels and digitization, which is evidenced by:

- Launch of fully digital account opening App under the name Meezan Digital Account
- Debit Cards portfolio growing to 2.8 million cards and Mobile App Registrations growing to over 1.7 million subscribers
- A 90% increase in Debit Cards spend
- An eight-fold increase in NFC transactions
- More than 80% increase in Inter Bank Fund Transfers (IBFT) and Utility Bill Payments volumes

Meezan Bank Annual Report 2022



CHAIRMAN SHARIAH BOARD’S MESSAGE


The following is a translation of the body of the above message of Justice (Retd.) Muhammad Taqi Usmani

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank has been operational for twenty-five years. It started operations as an Investment Bank and issued Riba-free Certificates of Islamic Investment. It got the commercial Islamic Banking licence in 2002 and was named Meezan Bank.

Alhamdulillah, Meezan Bank has progressed much faster compared to other banks. In the beginning it had only four branches and now, Alhamdulillah, its 950 branches have spread all over Pakistan and Meezan Bank has become the fourth largest bank in Pakistan. During 2018 and 2020, it was also awarded the Best Bank and also won the most Innovative Islamic Bank Global award as well as numerous other awards.

All this progress is due to the fact that from the very beginning, it ensured following Shariah in everything it does. To my knowledge, it is also the first bank to establish such a large team for ensuring Shariah-compliance in all its matters and several new products were also launched, and all this work was done under the supervision and monitoring of its Shariah Board.

Alhamdulillah, in my view, the Bank’s Shariah-compliance standards are very good and where there is an error they try to rectify it. I pay tribute to Mr. Irfan Siddiqui, Chief Executive Officer of Meezan Bank for his efforts, and congratulate him that the Bank has Masha’Allah progressed so much in a period of twenty-five years. May Allah Ta'ala help them further improve what they are doing and enable them to keep ever strengthening the Bank’s Islamic status.

I believe that Mr. Irfan will Insha’Allah focus on the remaining elements with the same level of industry and sincerity that he has shown in the Bank till now and the Bank will progress further in terms of both performance and Islamic standing. May Allah (SWT) help them in this with His grace and mercy.

# FOUNDING PRESIDENT & CEO’S MESSAGE

All praise is for the Almighty.

As we commemorate these 25 years of Meezan, it is also an opportunity for us all to reflect on the past, celebrate our successes, and prepare for the future.

We started with a simple yet ambitious Vision, "to establish Islamic banking as banking of first choice...," and today, Alhamdulillah, we stand proud amongst the largest, the most profitable, the most innovative and the highest rated banks in Pakistan. Our journey hasn't been easy, but it has been filled with determination, perseverance, and unwavering faith - and it is our values and principles that have been the guiding force throughout.

We have always been committed to offering Shariah-compliant banking services and, Alhamdulillah, we have been successful in doing so. We have shown that it is possible to do banking and business without compromising on our faith or principles. We have stayed true to our ethos, the ‘Meezan’.

We believe that our corporate culture is our greatest asset, and our commitment to our Core Values -- Shariah-compliance, Integrity and Service Excellence has helped us work as a focused team towards common goals. Moreover, the team’s emphasis on humility, pragmatism, hard work and diligence have played a crucial role in our success.

I am grateful to everyone who has been a part of this journey: our customers, employees and the shareholders have been fuel to the stellar growth and achievements, while our Shariah Board, the Board of Directors and of course, the Management Team have helped navigate the institution from strength to strength. Together, we have created an institution - and a culture - that has placed us in a league of our own.

Ultimately, Meezan Bank is much more than just a financial institution; Allah (SWT) has helped us become a force for good, a catalyst for change, and the founder and guardian of the now thriving Islamic finance sector in Pakistan. Islamic banking now has solid foundations in Pakistan - with six dedicated Islamic banks, and fourteen banks with Islamic windows. It has been an incredible journey from zero to today’s 21% of the total banking sector, and this proportion is expected to grow rapidly over the coming years Insha’Allah.

As we look to the future, we must continue to educate, innovate, and digitize to ensure that we remain at the forefront of banking in Pakistan, providing services of value to all.

We are grateful for our past, proud of our present, and excited about our future, Insha'Allah. As our journey continues, we pray that Allah (SWT) grants us the strength to stay true to our Vision and ethos, and continue to serve the people of Pakistan with the finest Shariah-compliant financial services. Ameen!

JazakAllah Khair

Irfan Siddiqui

Founding President and CEO



DEPUTY CEO’S MESSAGE

All praise is for the Almighty.

It is indeed gratifying to pen my thoughts on the completion of 25 years of Meezan Bank. This chapter in the history of Meezan Bank may well be unprecedented in the history of the financial sector in Pakistan, not only in terms of what the Bank has achieved but also because it has laid the foundation for a viable Islamic Banking system in the country, undoubtedly due to the Blessings of Allah (SWT).

As the fastest growing bank in Pakistan, since its inception as a fledgling Investment Bank in 1997, Meezan has successfully delivered on the expectations of its stakeholders and, at the same time, achieved numerous accolades that are by no means short of being superlative. For me personally, it has been a journey of immense satisfaction. I am especially proud of the founding team that has worked seamlessly as one coherent team and has yielded the results that we celebrate today. I would like to thank everyone who has been a part of this incredible journey for their contributions, no matter how big or small, because it is their collective effort and unwavering commitment to the Vision and Mission of Meezan that has brought the Bank to where it is today. Insha’Allah will endeavor to remain ahead of the curve in this regard.

And of course, we are thankful to our customers who have believed in us and have helped us grow.

I believe that 2022 – the completion of 20 years of Islamic commercial banking and 25 years of Meezan’s existence – will be seen as a watershed year in the Bank’s history. The advent of technology, accelerated manifold by the onslaught of COVID-19, brings both challenges and opportunities for banks.

May Allah (SWT) guide us in the future and help us stay committed to the Vision & Mission of Meezan Bank.

JazakAllah Khair

Ariful Islam

QUAID’S CONCEPT OF ISLAMIC BANKING

“I shall watch with keenness the work of your Research Organization in evolving banking practices compatible with Islamic ideas of social and economic life. The economic system of the West has created almost insoluble problems for humanity and to many of us it appears that only a miracle can save it from disaster that is now facing the world. It has failed to do justice between man and a man and to eradicate friction from the international field. On the contrary, it was largely responsible for the two world wars in the last half century. The Western world, inspite of its advantages of mechanisation and industrial efficiency is today in a worse mess than ever before in history. The adoption of Western economic theory and practice will not help us in achieving our goal of creating a happy and contended people. We must work our destiny in our own way and present to the world an economic system based on true Islamic concept of equality of manhood and social justice. We will thereby be fulfilling our mission as Muslims and giving to humanity the message of peace which alone can save it and secure the welfare, happiness and prosperity of mankind.”

— Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah

Founder of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan

On the occasion of the Opening Ceremony of The State Bank of Pakistan on July 1, 1948.

# CORPORATE PROFILE

Founded with the Vision to ‘Establish Islamic banking as banking of first choice...’, the Bank commenced operations in 1997 as Al Meezan Investment Bank Limited. It converted to Meezan Bank Limited, a full-fledged Islamic commercial bank in 2002, when the State Bank of Pakistan issued it Pakistan’s first Islamic Commercial Banking license. Concurrently, the Bank acquired the Pakistan operations of Societe Generale and started commercial banking with a small network of four branches, that has now grown to become one of the largest banking networks in the country with 962 branches in 317 cities.

Meezan Bank is a public listed company sponsored by leading financial institutions from Pakistan and the Middle East. The Bank offers a complete range of Islamic banking products and services through an extensive retail banking network.

# 25 years of Islamic Banking

Alhamdullillah, 2022 was a year of reflection and celebration for Meezan Bank. Formed with the Vision of establishing ‘Islamic banking as banking of first choice’ in 1997 as Al Meezan Investment Bank, this year marked the silver jubilee of our organisation as we completed twenty-five years of providing Riba-free banking services to our customers. As we reflect on our journey from being the smallest commercial bank in the country to one of the largest and most valued customer franchises, we must, first and foremost thank Allah SWT for his Blessings without which none of this would have been possible. At the same time, we are grateful for the extraordinary efforts and dedication of our current and past Directors of the Board, Members of the Shariah Board, Senior Management and employees in making this Vision a reality. We are fortunate that through Meezan Bank, the seed of Islamic banking has been sowed in Pakistan, and are proud of our efforts in growing the Islamic Banking Industry (IBI).

Meezan Bank is the youngest bank in Pakistan to have attained the prestigious AAA Credit Rating in just 19 years of operations and also has the highest market cap amongst all the banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.

Having laid down the foundations of Islamic banking in Pakistan to eliminate Riba from the country, our Bank’s successful endeavors have acted as a catalyst for developing landscape for Shariah-compliant banking and financing solutions for customers through innovation and capacity building across the IBI. We have historically conducted awareness sessions at all forums for the promotion of the Islamic finance and also played our pioneering role in development of Islamic banking certifications at leading education institutions to foster and enrich Islamic bankers in the country. As a direct result of these steps, today the Islamic Banking Industry has grown from a single institution to six full-fledged Islamic banks and fifteen Islamic banking windows of conventional banks. Many of the prominent Islamic banking ambassadors have been nurtured and trained with us in one way or the other. The market share of dedicated Islamic banks and Islamic banking windows now stands at 21%.

We sincerely acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the Government of Pakistan (GoP) and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for developing the IBI in Pakistan. The Honourable Federal Shariat Court (FSC)’s much awaited verdict on Riba, to complete conversion of the financial system to a Shariah-compliant interest-free system in five years, is an important milestone for us. We wish to place on record our appreciation for the formation of Steering Committee by the GoP’s Finance Division for implementation of FSC’s decision. We feel immense joy in informing you that the Chairman of our Shariah Board, Justice (Retd.) Muhammad Taqi Usmani and our Founding President and CEO, Mr. Irfan Siddiqui have been nominated as members of this Steering Committee to provide strategic guidance and support, aid in capacity building and monitor the progress in implementation of the FSC’s verdict on a Riba-free Pakistan. The Board acknowledges the extraordinary contributions of our Chairman Shariah Board and our President & CEO towards the promotion of Islamic banking. We firmly believe that we owe our success to the blessings of Allah (SWT) and strong adherence to our Core Values of Shariah-compliance, Integrity and Service Excellence.

# Economic Overview

2022 started on high hopes as the world economy started to rebound on recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this optimism was short-lived and soon ended with the emergence of the Russia–Ukraine conflict that trigged a downward spiral in global macroeconomic environment and led to a commodity super cycle (including oil) affecting economies around the world. For emerging markets like Pakistan, the economic challenges were further exacerbated due to a turn in the global interest rate cycle. Resultantly, Pakistan’s economy, after posting a GDP growth of 6.0% in fiscal year 2022, slowed down with significant contraction in latter part of the year.

The economic challenges were further amplified with the convergence of domestic political unrest and unprecedented catastrophic floods that rendered more than 30 million people homeless and washed away thousands of cattle and agriculture crops, resulting in balance of payments pressures, fiscal slippages and high inflation. Inflation rose from 12.3% at the beginning of the year to 24.5% in December 2022. In response to the rising inflation in the country, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) also tightened its monetary policy stance thereby raising the policy rate (benchmark rate) in a staggered manner from 9.75 percent at the beginning of 2022 to 16 percent by the end of 2022 - a cumulative rise of 625 basis points. In January 2023, the benchmark rate was further increased to 17 percent. The exit from the FATF grey list was overshadowed by the concerns on macro-economic stability. The national bourse also witnessed a decline and lost 9 percent of its value, closing at 40,420 points compared to a level of 44,596 points in 2021.

The Federal Government is striving to control non-essential imports, enforcing austerity measures and striking a balance between fiscal prudence and economic relief for the masses. The resumption of IMF program will unlock the financial support from friendly countries and other multilateral institutions. In another positive development, Pakistan was able to secure total pledges of around $10 billion in the International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan which took place in January 2023.

# Profitability

# Net Spread

Return on financings, investments, and placements increased to Rs 232 billion from Rs 110 billion last year – higher by 111% driven by substantial rise in earning assets and a higher underlying benchmark policy rate. The average policy rate during the year increased from 7.29% to 13.20%. The return on deposits and borrowings also increased to Rs 110 billion from Rs 41 billion in 2021 – higher by 168% due to an increase in average deposits and borrowings volume and an increase in depositors’ profit rates.

# 28% Growth in Non-funded income - Driven by Rise in Trade Volumes & Digital Initiatives

Fee, commission and other income posted a robust uptick of 43% to Rs 14.6 billion from Rs 10.2 billion last year, led by an increase in debit cards, trade and branch banking related income. In 2022, more than 400,000 cards were added to our debit card portfolio, growing the portfolio size to over 2.8 million cards. Overall spend on debit cards also grew from Rs 78 billion to Rs 149 billion, a rise of 90%, with NFC transactions increasing by 8 times. Similarly, Inter Bank Fund Transfers (IBFT) and Utility Bill Payments (UBP) volumes reached a total throughput of Rs 2 trillion and Rs 400 billion respectively with transactions count growing by 83% and 82%. Our state-of-the-art mobile banking app continues to provide a seamless platform for customers to carry out their digital transactions in a secure and efficient manner. Meezan Bank’s mobile banking application remained the industry leader, with an unbeatable 4.9 rating on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store throughout the year. Nearly 1.4 million ‘financially active’ customers used our mobile application to conduct more than 166 million digital transactions in 2022.

Our trade business volume reached Rs 2.2 trillion compared to Rs 1.7 trillion a year ago. We consider trade finance business a key segment as it not only contributes to fee income but also attracts current account balances which in turn drive higher profitability. Our extensive network of correspondent banks aids us in aggressively competing for trade business. Foreign exchange income also rose by 15% due to strong trade flows, prudent risk mitigation and concerted sales efforts. On an overall basis, non-funded income recorded a 28% growth, closing at Rs 19.1 billion.

# Operating expenses

Operating and other expenses also increased by 37% to Rs 48.2 billion from Rs 35.3 billion, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the opening of 60 new branches during the year; a substantial rise in inflation; steep rupee devaluation and investment in IT-related initiatives. Notwithstanding this increase in expenses, our income efficiency ratio improved to 34% from 42% last year due to our continued focus on cost rationalization, process automation and an efficient operating cycle.

# Taxation – Contribution to the National Exchequer

The Federal Government, through Finance Act 2022, raised the tax rate on banking companies to 49% for the year 2022 (39% normal tax and 10% Super Tax) versus 39% in 2021 (35% normal tax and 4% Super Tax). As a result of this increase in tax rate and due to growth in our profitability, we have recorded a higher tax charge of Rs 43.4 billion for 2022 (2021: Rs 19.1 billion).




Furthermore, Federal Government increased additional penal tax rate for banks failing to maintain Gross Advance to Deposit Ratio (ADR) above 50% level. However, we did not attract this additional penal tax, due to our efficient tax strategy to maintain ADR at 50% plus levels.

During 2022, we also collected, withheld, and deposited Rs 21.9 billion (2021: Rs 16.4 billion) in the National Exchequer, on account of Income Tax / Federal Excise Duty / Provincial Sales Tax on Services as withholding tax agent on behalf of the Federal Board of Revenue and Provincial Tax Authorities.

Gross advances to deposits ratio (ADR) also rose to a comfortable level of 61% from 53% last year.

We continued to actively support the SBP-led initiatives for increasing financial inclusion and overall economic development of the country through participation under several refinance schemes and initiatives. These included Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan Program, Islamic SME Asaan Finance (ISAAF), and Roshan Apna Ghar and Roshan Apni Car schemes for Non-Resident Pakistanis, to name a few. We have also extended our support to the agriculture sector and exceeded the SBP assigned targets of agriculture credit disbursement for 2021-22. The total exposure under various SBP refinance schemes has increased by more than 25%.

To support and promote affordable Islamic housing finance for the masses, we have joined hands with the Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC) this year. We have also introduced a new product – “Meezan Women First – Car Ijarah” to reduce the gender gap in financial inclusion. Concerning United Nations Environmental Social Governance Framework, we are actively extending solar financing to reduce the carbon footprint in the economy.

# Non-Performing Financings and Provisions

During 2022, a specific provision charge of Rs 815 million and a reversal of Rs 1.48 billion was recorded against non-performing financings. In view of recent catastrophic floods and the risk of any potential non-performing financings arising given the current economic slowdown, an additional general provision of Rs 3.75 billion was made during the year which takes the non-performing financing coverage ratio to 166% - one of the highest in the banking industry.

# Growth in Investments

Our investment portfolio grew by 107% to Rs 1.28 trillion from Rs 620 billion last year. The issuance of GoP Ijarah Sukuk at regular intervals enabled us to increase the size of our investment book and reduce dependency on inter-bank secured placements under Bai Muajjal. During the year, an additional Rs 706 billion were invested in GoP Ijarah Sukuk taking the total GoP Ijarah Sukuk portfolio to Rs 1.1 trillion from Rs 398 billion. Out of the total investment portfolio, 98% represents investment in Federal Government / Government Guaranteed Securities.

The implementation of SBP’s Shariah-compliant Open Market Operations (OMO-Injections) and Shariah-compliant Standing Ceiling Facility has immensely helped the Islamic Banking Industry to manage its day-to-day liquidity more efficiently, for which we remain grateful to the Government of Pakistan and the SBP.

# Branch Network

Our Bank follows a hybrid growth model underpinned by expanding its physical presence in underserved areas of the country whilst simultaneously augmenting its digital footprint through innovative offerings and smooth channel migration. With this spirit, another sixty branches in twenty-seven new cities were added to our network during the year. Our geographical network now stands at 962 branches in 317 cities (2021: 902 Branches in 290 cities). We believe that continued expansion in both physical and digital space is important, owing to the large, diversified, and geographically dispersed unbanked population of the country.

In addition to the branch network, we operate with an extensive network of 1,000 plus ATMs across the country.

# Future Outlook and Strategy

Meezan Bank remains committed to contributing to the economic growth and stability of the country by strengthening the IBI and assisting the government to shift towards Shariah-compliant banking solutions in line with the SBP’s vision to increase the market share of the IBI to 30% from its current level of around 21% over the next three years.

We intend to maintain our share of IBI deposits and follow a balanced-growth strategy for deposits and financings in the year ahead. We are ready to further diversify our exposures in different sectors of the economy while keeping all the risk acceptance parameters in check. Acknowledging our national obligation, active participation in SBP-led initiatives for increasing financial inclusion would also remain an area of focus. We will continue to maintain our financial stability ratios above the regulatory requirements and will further strengthen our equity base in line with our future growth plans.

Expansion will continue in line with our hybrid growth strategy – acknowledging the importance of both physical and digital outreach of the country. We will continue to invest in technology and offer the best-in-class digital services to our customers and maintain our distinction as the frontrunner in the banking industry in this domain. We will InshaAllah launch our Shariah-compliant alternative to Credit Card and employ a new high-tech Card Management System which will provide innovative solutions to our customers along with state-of-the art upgraded version of Customer Relationship Management System.

# Performance Evaluation Mechanism for the Board

Members of the Board of Directors and its sub committees are competent and experienced individuals, representing diversified educational and vocational backgrounds which are invaluable in determining the overall direction of the organization.

The Board of Directors is keen to ensure that it reviews the effectiveness of its performance periodically. To that end, all individual Board members answer a comprehensive questionnaire focused on evaluating, from various angles, whether the Board has discharged its duties diligently and with foresight. A committee of Directors is designated to manage the Board’s self-evaluation exercise and present its findings to the Board for deliberation and discussion.

During the self-evaluation exercise, the Board evaluates itself from the following perspectives:

- Evaluation of the overall Board
- Evaluation of the Chairperson
- Evaluation of Individual Directors
- Evaluation of Independent Directors
- Evaluation of Board Committees
- Evaluation of the CEO

This exercise in critical self-assessment allows the Board to evaluate its performance and overall effectiveness in setting strategies, devising controls, reading market trends by monitoring micro and macroeconomic factors and responding to adverse unforeseen situations to further the cause of a learning organization. This process also ensures that the Board is constantly growing intellectually and the responsibility of steering the Bank to new heights of success is discharged effectively and efficiently.

The SBP Guidelines require that at least once in every three years, the evaluation should be conducted by an external independent evaluator. The Bank engaged Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG) as an independent evaluator to conduct this evaluation in 2018 and 2021 while for 2022 this exercise is conducted by adopting an in-house approach using quantitative techniques, as per SBP guidelines.

# GROWTH IN 2022

# Business Review

Despite deteriorating macroeconomic indicators and political uncertainty, the Bank continued its growth momentum during the year with total assets crossing Rs 2.5 trillion - a 35% growth over the preceding year. The supportive liquidity management framework adopted by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) enabled the Bank to channel its excess liquidity into Government of Pakistan (GoP) Ijarah Sukuk which led to an increase in the Bank’s investment book by approximately Rs 660 billion. The Bank maintained its strategic focus of mobilizing deposits across all sectors of the economy whilst maintaining its Gross Advances to Deposits Ratio (ADR) above 50%. Key highlights of the Bank’s business activities are as follows:

| Total Assets                               | 2022             | 2021             | Growth |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Islamic Financing & Related Assets – Gross | Rs 2.57 trillion | Rs 1.9 trillion  | 33%    |
| Investments                                | Rs 1.28 trillion | Rs 620 billion   | 160%   |
| Deposits                                   | Rs 1.66 trillion | Rs 1.46 trillion | 14%    |
| Due to Financial Institutions              | Rs 573 billion   | Rs 220 billion   | 7%     |
| Total Equity                               | Rs 115 billion   | Rs 87 billion    | 33%    |
| Total Branches                             | 962              | 902              |        |

Notwithstanding the ongoing economic slowdown as a result of monetary contraction, the Bank was able to grow its financing portfolio by 31% while keeping all asset quality parameters in check. The Bank’s gross financing assets crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark for the first time and is now the third largest financing portfolio in the industry. The biggest contributor to this increase was the Bank’s Corporate & Institutional Banking segment with growth being well distributed across public-sector entities and private sector blue-chip companies. Commercial and SME portfolio also showed a healthy growth driven by the Bank’s strategy to bring Shariah-compliant banking solutions to the doorstep of small and medium size enterprises – which represent a sizable share in overall GDP of the country. Consumer Financing segment of the Bank maintained its growth momentum in early 2022 but showed considerable slow-down in the latter part of the year due to changes in Prudential Regulations and supply chain disruptions in the automobile sector.

It is pertinent to note that there was no increase in the overall non-performing financing (NPL) portfolio despite a significant rise in overall size of the financing book with economic headwinds and catastrophic flood plaguing the country during the year. Instead, the Bank witnessed a decline in NPLs which reduced to Rs 13.6 billion from Rs 14.5 billion last year, with the NPL infection ratio improving further to 1.3%. This not only demonstrates the resilience of the Bank’s customer base but also the robustness of its credit & risk assessment process and swift follow-up and prompt recovery mechanism. The Bank continued to build up for any potential NPLs and further beefed up its additional general provision which now stands at Rs 9.1 billion. The NPL coverage ratio has increased to 166% from 133% last year, which is one of the highest in the banking industry.

The Bank’s investment portfolio recorded a two-fold increase following fresh investment in GoP Ijarah Sukuk. The Bank’s variable rate GoP Ijarah Sukuk now amount to Rs 854 billion while it also holds Rs 256 billion of fixed rate Ijarah Sukuk. The Bank’s portfolio of Bai Muajjal with other financial institutions decreased to Rs 35 billion from Rs 238 billion in 2021 as it deployed its liquidity in GoP Ijarah Sukuk. The Bank also increased its borrowing from SBP through Shariah-compliant Mudarabah based Open Market Operations (OMO).

The Current and Savings Account (CASA) deposits base of the Bank grew to Rs 1.46 trillion which is even higher than the Bank’s total deposits a year ago. The Bank’s CASA deposits have grown by 21%, representing 88% of deposit mix. The Bank rationalized its deposit mix and reduced its fixed deposit portfolio by 20% from last year. Nonetheless, similar to previous years, the Bank’s overall deposits growth of 14% outpaced the overall industry deposit growth of 7%.

Driven by the growth in the Bank’s business activities and increase in underlying SBP policy rate, the Bank’s Profit After Tax grew to Rs 45 billion as compared to 28 billion last year – up by 59%, contributed by rise in both funded and non-funded income. Net spread grew to Rs 122 billion from Rs 69 billion in 2021 with non-funded income registering a 48% growth, closing at Rs 19.1 billion as compared to Rs 14.9 billion in 2021. Trade finance, branch banking and debit card related incomes were key drivers of the increase in non-funded income. The substantial growth in profitability enabled the Bank to build up its reserves and contributed to its strong equity base, which would enable it to sustain its growth trajectory. The Bank’s total equity grew to Rs 115 billion, up by 33% from last year, after distribution to its shareholders out of current year’s profits.

Meezan Bank has maintained its dominance in the local foreign exchange and money markets as an active market maker and formidable player. 2022 was marked with extreme volatility in exchange rate; stemming from the aftermath of the floods, local political uncertainty and a reeling post-COVID global economy further dampened by the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war. During 2022, the Bank curtailed potential exchange losses through its prudent exchange rate risk management.

The Bank was able to capture a significant portion of the total Sukuk issued by GoP during the year, which in turn allowed it to optimize the risk profile of its investment portfolio while maximizing earnings. The implementation of Shariah-compliant Mudarabah based Open Market Operations - Injections facility (OMO) has enabled Islamic banks to generate funding from the SBP for their requirements. Meezan Bank was a key player in the introduction of this facility as well as a major participant.

A total of 646 elevations were made across the Bank at different levels during the year.

Another new initiative that the Bank has taken is the introduction of ‘Iddat leave With Pay’ for its divorced or widowed female staff. The Bank also provides support to family members of its deceased staff by giving them a monthly payment for a period of 5 years from the staff’s passing away.

Meezan Bank had launched its Employee Benevolent Fund Trust (EBFT) program in November 2012 for providing financial assistance to its employees and their families for medical, marriage and education related expenses on need and merit basis. This year the Bank has helped 272 families through EBFT.

# Statement of Financial Position

# Assets

Total Assets of the Bank crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2022 growing from Rs 789 billion in 2017 - a significant leap, taking Meezan Bank from a mid-sized entity to the league of big banks in Pakistan. The net financing portfolio has increased to Rs 995 billion from Rs 420 billion – up by Rs 575 billion representing a five year CAGR of 19%. Throughout this period, the Bank maintained its focus on channelising liquidity in all sectors of the economy.

Corporate book led the growth in financing with the portfolio now totaling Rs 754 billion, representing more than 70% of the financing book. The Bank’s SME / Commercial and Consumer portfolios also witnessed a healthy growth of 25% and 14% respectively. The Bank continues to have one of the lowest infection ratio of 1.3% in the industry demonstrating the superior quality and resilience of its financing portfolio. Accordingly, despite significant growth in total assets in the period from 2017 to 2022, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio has increased to a comfortable level of 18.42% in 2022, compared to a minimum requirement of 12%.

The Bank’s investment portfolio also recorded manifold growth closing at Rs 1.3 trillion from Rs 119 billion in 2017. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank’s total investment in GoP Ijarah Sukuk amounted to Rs 1.1 trillion and Pakistan Energy Sukuk (guaranteed by the Federal Government) amounted to Rs 120 billion. The resumption of Government of Pakistan (GoP) Ijarah Sukuk auctions at regular intervals have addressed the chronic liquidity deployment challenges faced by the Islamic Banking Industry. This enabled the Bank to reduce the dependency on inter-bank secured placements under Bai Muajjal which decreased to Rs 35 billion (around 1% of the Balance sheet) compared to Rs 147 billion (19% of the balance sheet).

The Bank’s fixed assets (excluding right-of-use assets recognized under IFRS 16) have also increased to Rs 29 billion in 2022 from Rs 11 billion in 2017 primarily due to the Bank’s sizeable investment in its Branch network which reached 962 branches in 2022 as compared to 601 branches in 2017 – an increase of 361 branches during the period. This expansion in the branch network has reaped fruits for the Bank, as is evident from the strong growth in deposits and profits over the years. The Bank’s significant investment in IT infrastructure and digital channels (including Internet Banking and Mobile App) also contributed to this growth in fixed and intangible assets.

# Profit and Loss account

The Bank’s Profit After Tax has recorded seven times increase - from Rs 6.3 billion in 2017 to Rs 45 billion in 2022 with an average Return on Equity (ROE) of more than 30% while maintaining an unbroken payout to its shareholders. In line with the growth in the Bank’s deposit profile and increase in the underlying SBP policy rate, the net spread of the Bank rose to Rs 122 billion as compared to Rs 21 billion in 2017. Fee, foreign exchange and other income also grew significantly from Rs 5.6 billion in 2017 to Rs 18.2 billion in 2022, primarily due to the Bank’s growing trade business which crossed Rs 2.1 trillion as compared to Rs 710 billion in 2017. The Bank’s tremendous growth in digital banking business also played a significant role in this growth duly complemented by a significant increase in its customer base.

The Bank’s operating expenses rose to Rs 48 billion in 2022 from Rs 17 billion in 2017. High inflation, rupee devaluation and continuous investment in physical and digital banking channels contributed to the increase in operating costs. The Bank now employs more than 15,000 staff across Pakistan, thereby creating more employment opportunities for the country’s population. Despite the increase in operating expenses, the Bank’s income efficiency ratio improved to 34% in 2022 from 59% in 2017.

# Statement of Financial Position

The total assets of the Bank grew by 35% or Rs 674 billion to cross the Rs 2.5 trillion landmark from Rs 1.9 trillion in 2021. Investments and financings both witnessed significant growth during the year.

The Gross Financings portfolio crossed Rs 1 trillion – Rs 241 billion or 31% up from last year with the Gross Advance to Deposits ratio (ADR) of the Bank hovering above 61% versus 53% last year. This growth was well-distributed across large-sized corporates, small and medium-sized commercial entities and retail consumers with financial inclusion being a key focus. Active participation in the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) refinancing schemes also remained a top priority for the Bank as the total exposure under such schemes grew by more than 25%. The Bank has a market share of around 8.6% of overall banking industry financings.

The Bank’s financing portfolio maintained its exemplary quality with the infection ratio falling to 1.3% compared to an average for the banking industry of around 7%. The Bank’s coverage ratio stood at 166% - well above the banking industry average of 92%.

Investments portfolio also doubled to Rs 1.3 trillion from Rs 620 billion in 2021 mainly due to sizeable investment in Federal Government Securities – GoP Ijarah Sukuk which now represent Rs 1.1 trillion as compared to Rs 398 billion a year ago. The Bank’s placements under Bai Muajjal reduced from Rs 238 billion in 2021 to Rs 35 billion in current year mainly due to surplus liquidity being deployed towards the regular auction of GoP Ijarah Sukuk.

Continuing our tradition of outpacing the industry, yet again the Bank’s deposits growth surpassed the banking industry deposit growth and registered an uptick of 14% versus 7% for the banking industry as a whole. Meezan Bank’s deposit book now stands at Rs 1.66 trillion with Current Account (CA) and Savings Account (SA) deposits amounting to Rs 1.46 trillion – which is even higher than the total deposits of the Bank a year ago. The Bank has a market share of 7.4% of banking industry deposits with a CAGR growth of 34% since its inception. The major contribution of this growth is due to CASA deposits which grew by 21%, representing 88% of the deposit mix.

The Bank’s deposits depict a high level of granularity with individual depositors representing more than 60% of the deposit portfolio - a yardstick reflective of customers’ preference and trust for choosing Meezan for their banking needs.

During the year, the Bank added 60 new branches to its network providing a vast coverage of 962 branches spread across 317 cities of the country supported by a network of 1,000 plus biometric-enabled card less ATMs. Apart from the physical infrastructure, the Bank has a strong presence in digital channels as well which can be witnessed by the continuous rise in the Bank’s debit card spent and increase in Inter Bank Fund Transfers (IBFT) and Utility Bill Payments (UBPS) transactions respectively. The Bank’s Mobile Banking App remained the industry leader, with an unbeatable 4.9 rating on both Apple Store and Google Play Store throughout the year.

The Bank’s equity increased to Rs 115 billion as compared to Rs 87 billion a year ago. The Board has approved a final cash dividend of Rs 3.00 per share (30%) bringing the total payout to Rs 8.50 per share (85%) as Rs 5.50 per share i.e. 55% interim cash dividend was paid in addition to issuance of 10% Bonus Shares during the year.

The Bank remains adequately capitalized with a Capital Adequacy Ratio of 18.42% over and above the minimum regulatory requirement of 12%.

The Bank manages its risks through a framework of sound risk management principles which includes identification of potential risks, establishment of risk tolerance and control limits, assessment of the impact of potential risks and formulation of policies, procedures and strategies to mitigate risks to the Bank while ensuring continuous monitoring and reporting to stakeholders as well. While the Board provides policy framework and sets strategic direction, the Bank’s management is required to formulate procedures, establish organizational structure, introduce systems and monitoring tools to ensure their implementation.

Moreover, the Bank continued its role as an active player in increasing Roshan Digital Accounts deposit base. Continuous flow of GoP Ijarah Sukuk remained an element of relief to the Islamic banks in managing their excess liquidity.

Year 2023 is expected to be challenging as well. The management of fiscal account, external funding, higher inflation, FX reserve position and exchange rate coupled with rehabilitation of flood-affected areas, will be the key determinants for the economy of Pakistan and banking sector. Higher policy rate and economic slowdown may also increase the credit risk and weaken demand for financing and supply chain disruptions will put further stress on the economy.

# Materiality Approach

The Bank gives due consideration to materiality concept while managing its risks. Resources are deployed efficiently in medium to high risk areas while minor risks are typically managed through transfer and outsourcing arrangements. The Bank manages all its core operations on its own. Regulatory and Shariah-compliance is at the heart of the Bank’s materiality approach while managing existing operations and taking new initiatives.

Meezan Bank will continue its journey of growth by exploring opportunities to achieve its strategic objectives, while ensuring effective risk mitigants and controls in place, Insha’Allah.

# BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

The Bank’s Business Continuity Plans are developed in a way that enable management of the impact of any significant disruptions and ensure uninterrupted operations. The Bank has implemented well-defined, approved plans, effective decision-making processes, outlined description of distressed scenarios and roles and responsibilities of various functions, so as to ensure coordinated efforts among stakeholders and operational continuity in case of any disruption. Simultaneously, the Bank has also been able to leverage on its technology infrastructure and improve upon its IT Disaster Recovery Set-up, to develop the right contingency plans and mitigating actions beforehand.

The Business Continuity Management (BCM) framework at the Bank facilitates the continuance of business activities and safeguards the interests of the Bank’s key stakeholders in the event of crisis situations by ensuring appropriate availability of systems. The implementation of the BCM Framework ensures safety of human resources, protection of critical assets and resumption of mission critical activities from alternate processing site(s) in case the primary site(s) are not accessible or available. At Meezan Bank, the first priority is always to ensure the safety of human life in case of any disaster.

The recent floods wreaked havoc in various parts of Pakistan. In such challenging times, Meezan Bank, through effective BCP structure, ensured continued banking services in flood-affected areas. Meezan Bank’s ADC channels, strong IT support and Alternative Processing Sites arrangements enabled continued services to its valued customers.

RESPONDING TO CRITICAL CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES

Global economic situation and geopolitical turmoil, mainly Russia and Ukraine War has resulted in massive commodity price volatility, creating economic challenges world-wide. The global economic conditions have impacted Pakistan adversely. Higher profit benchmark rates, coupled with economic slowdown and supply chain disruptions, and high rate of inflation will result in adverse impact on paying capacity of financing customers which may translate into high-risk of Non-Performing Financing. Higher rates will also result in adverse impact on carrying value of fixed income investments. Moreover, macroeconomic challenges including external debt concerns, depleting foreign currency reserves, adverse movement in exchange rate and political uncertainty remain key concerns for the banking industry. Additionally, the country experienced catastrophic floods during the second half of the year which would exacerbate economic challenges by putting further pressure on foreign currency reserves and inflation due to higher import bill for agriculture produce.

To maintain high level of assets quality, the Bank has equipped itself through robust risk assessment mechanism, effective portfolio management, limits structuring, four-eye financing approval mechanism, rapid portfolio review and post disbursement monitoring to minimize the level of its non-performing assets portfolio.

Considering the exponential growth in digital banking, the Bank has state-of-the-art digital platforms in place including mobile app and internet banking, enabling it to provide efficient platforms to customers for performing their banking transactions hassle-free. Continuous growth of digital banking, has resulted in elevated cyber security risk for banks. To manage the associated risks, the Bank has an independent Information Security Department in place, manned with experienced and qualified resources. The Bank conducts regular cyber security reviews and penetration testing and awareness sessions for its staff.

# WHAT MAKES US RIBA-FREE

Islamic banks offer products that are fundamentally different from those offered by conventional banks. While the business model of conventional banks is simply lending funds on interest, the business model of Islamic banks involves direct participation in trade, real assets and partnership-based activities. Moreover, Islamic banks enter into multiple types of multiple trade-based relationships with the customer by virtue of the underlying contracts unlike conventional banks, where the only bank-customer relationship is of a lender and borrower.

# Criteria for Performance Evaluation

The Board of Directors, while ensuring regulatory compliance, is also vested with fiduciary responsibility on behalf of the shareholders to protect the Bank’s interests, provide strategic direction and monitor the achievement of strategic objectives. The Companies Act 2017, Banking Companies Ordinance 1962, SBP’s Corporate Governance Regulatory Framework (CGRF) and Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations 2019 describe the role of Board of Directors along with its responsibilities and functions.

To comply with the regulatory requirement, the Board, in the year 2014, put in place an effective mechanism for Board Evaluation. All individual Board members answer a comprehensive questionnaire focused on evaluating, from various angles, whether the Board has discharged its duties diligently and with foresight. A committee of Directors is designated to collate individual responses and present them to the Board for deliberation and discussion. As per process, the responses/feedback from the Directors on each of the above-mentioned categories is compiled and submitted to the Chairman. The Chairman discusses the results/findings with each individual Board Member. The authorized Independent Directors communicate the feedback in respect of the Chairman for incorporation in the consolidated Performance Report.

Accordingly, the analysis comprises of consolidated evaluation results and Action Plan forwarded by the Chairman to further strengthen comparatively weaker areas and is submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration in its meeting. This exercise in critical self-assessment allows the Board to evaluate its performance and overall effectiveness in setting strategies, devising control processes, reading market trends by monitoring micro and macroeconomic factors, and responding to adverse unforeseen situations to further the cause of a learning organization. This process also ensures that the Board is constantly growing intellectually and the responsibility of steering the Bank to new heights of success is discharged effectively and efficiently.

The mechanism put in place allows for such matters to be reported electronically, in writing or over the phone. To ensure that the stakeholders may register their complaints conveniently, a multitude of online forms are available on Meezan Bank’s corporate website (www.meezanbank.com).

A dedicated email (complaints@meezanbank.com) is also in place for the express purpose of reporting issues if the stakeholder feels the need to email rather than use online forms. Furthermore, grievances may also be lodged by calling the Bank’s Call Center (UAN: 111-331-331 & 111-331-332), which is functional round the clock, where officers are available to assist stakeholders with their queries and complaints.

# Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations; 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of Meezan Bank Limited (the Bank) for the year ended December 31, 2022 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank's compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank's corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022.

# STATEMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROLS

This statement is presented to comply with the requirements of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s BSD Circular No. 7 of 2004 dated May 27, 2004 “Guidelines on Internal Controls”, SBP’s OSED Circular No.01 dated February 07, 2014 and SBP BSD-1 Circular Letter No. 1 of 2021 dated July 06, 2021 on “Instructions on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)”.

The management of the Bank is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective system of internal controls which has the main objective of ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The control activities are being closely monitored across the Bank through Compliance, Risk Management, Shariah and Internal Audit departments, which covers all banking activities in general and key risk areas in particular. The Management has Compliance and Operational Risk Management Committee (CORMC) which focuses on compliance risk issues and reviews the adequacy of controls and systems to meet the regulatory requirements. The Board of Directors has formed an Audit Committee which has direct oversight responsibility to ensure the independence of the internal and external audit function. The Audit Committee meets at least once every quarter to discuss the scope and results of the work performed by the Compliance, Shariah and Internal Audit departments. The Audit Committee also meets with external auditors prior to approval of half-yearly and annual results of the Bank.

Based on observations and weaknesses found and identified by Internal and External auditors and the Compliance, Risk Management and Shariah audit teams, improvements are brought about by the management in internal controls to ensure non-recurrence of those exceptions and elimination of such weaknesses to the maximum possible level. Further, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements including AML/CFT requirements, compliance managers along with their teams are also placed in major regions.

While the Internal Controls System is effectively implemented and monitored, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system, including the possibility of human error or system failure, circumvention and overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the system's objective will be achieved.

Alhamdulillah, the Bank had successfully completed all stages of its ICFR program during 2014 and has been granted exemption from the requirement of submission of Auditor-issued Long Form Report through SBP OSED letter /SU-12/017(01)/358/15 dated January 05, 2015. As required by the State Bank of Pakistan, the Bank now prepares annual assessment report on efficacy of ICFR duly signed by the Chairman, Audit Committee. Having successfully achieved closure on ICFR, the Bank remains cognizant of its responsibility to continuously improve and strengthen its system of Internal Controls on an on-going basis.

Based on the above, the Board of Directors endorses the management's evaluation of Internal Controls.

On behalf of the Board.

# Conclusion

As per the charter of the Bank, it is mandatory for the management and employees to ensure application of Shariah principles and guidelines issued by the SB and RSBM and to ensure Shariah-compliance in all activities of the Bank. The prime responsibility for ensuring Shariah-compliance of the Bank’s operations thus lies with the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

Based on extensive reviews of sample cases for each class of transaction, related documentations, processes, profit distribution mechanism for the depositors by SCD, review of Internal Shariah Audit and External Shariah Audit reports and Management’s representation made in this regard, the Bank, in our opinion, has complied with the rules & principles of Islamic Shariah in light of the guidelines and directives given by the Shariah Board, Resident Shariah Board Member of Meezan Bank and guidelines issued by Shariah Advisory Committee of the SBP related to Shariah-compliance. The non-compliant income identified during the review is being transferred to the Charity Account through a well-defined system and is being utilized properly in accordance with the instructions of the Shariah Board.

Based on the strength and capacity of the full-fledged SC department and policies/guidelines for Shariah-compliance issued at the Bank, we are of the opinion that an effective mechanism is in place to ensure Shariah-compliance in overall operations of the Bank.

May Allah (     ) bless us with the best tawfeeq to accomplish His cherished tasks, make us successful in this world and in the life Hereafter and forgive our mistakes.

Wassalam Alaikum WaRahmat Allah Wa Barakatuh.

# INDUS HOSPITAL & HEALTH NETWORK

Meezan Bank has long understood its responsibility towards the planet, its customers, its communities and the country. The Bank has therefore committed itself to sustainable energy and reducing the carbon footprint of its activities.

During 2022, the Bank donated Rs 35 million to Indus Hospital & Health Network (IHHN) for installation of a solar panels system. The initiative is part of the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability initiatives and will provide financing to cover part of the 1.2MW solar power project being installed on the hospital’s rooftop.

The system financed by the Bank will generate nearly 250 KW of electricity, reducing approximately 75 tons of Carbon dioxide emissions per annum, which is equivalent to taking over 20 gasoline-powered vehicles off the road for one year.

With this solar panel system installation, IHHN would be able to reduce its rising electricity expenses while channelling those funds towards patients’ welfare. The collaboration between both the parties promises a shared sustainable future for the community at large, benefitting healthcare of individuals – thus fulfilling one of the core objectives defined in the Bank’s CSR policy.

# SUKUK

Since 2020 Pakistan has issued Sukuk, worth more than PKR 2.6 trillion! This collaborative effort of the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan lead by the Ministry of Finance is reflective of the volume and potential of Islamic Banking. Not only is this a step away from Riba, closer to the constitution of Pakistan and making Quaid-e-Azam’s dream a reality but has also resulted in significant cost savings for the Government.

| 1     | Provision against Islamic financing and related assets (Refer notes 6.3.2 and 1.1 to the unconsolidated financial statements) | The Bank makes provision against Islamic financing and related assets on a time-based criteria that involves ensuring that all non-performing Islamic financing and related assets are classified in accordance with the ageing criteria specified in the Prudential Regulations (PRs) issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). In addition to the above time-based criteria, the PRs require subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of borrowers to determine the classification of Islamic financing and related assets. The PRs also require the creation of general provision for certain categories of Islamic financing and related assets. The Bank has recognised net provision against Islamic financing and related assets amounting to Rs. 3,249.734 million in the unconsolidated profit and loss account in the current year. At December 31, 2022, the Bank holds a provision of Rs. 22,593.403 million against Islamic financing and related assets. The determination of provision against Islamic financing and related assets based on the above criteria remains significant and is a matter of judgement and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgements and estimations and the materiality of Islamic financing and related assets relative to the overall unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank, we considered the area of provision against Islamic financing and related assets as a key audit matter. We selected a sample of Islamic financing accounts and performed the following substantive procedures:- Checked repayments of Islamic financing profit instalments.
- Tested classification of non-performing Islamic financing and related assets based on the number of days overdue.
- Evaluated the management's assessment for classification of customer financing facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern.
- Inspected credit documentation and had thorough discussions with the management.
- Checked the accuracy of provision made against specific performing Islamic financing and related assets and of general provision by recomputing the amount of provision as per the requirements of PRs. |

# Information Other than the Unconsolidated and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Reports Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the unconsolidated and consolidated financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon. Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact; we have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance; 1962 and the Companies Act; 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations; or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error; as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

# Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements

including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit;

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters applicable; related safeguards that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication:

1. Proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XLX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. The unconsolidated statement of financial position; the unconsolidated profit and loss account; the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income; the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and the unconsolidated cash flow statement together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. Investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank; and
4. Zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under section 7 of that Ordinance.

We confirm that for the purpose of our audit we have covered more than sixty per cent of the total Islamic financing and related assets of the Bank:

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Bank provides Islamic financing and related assets mainly through Murabaha, Istisna, Tijarah, Ijarah, Diminishing Musharakah, Running Musharakah, Bai Muajjal, Musawammah, Service Ijarah, Wakalah, Wakalah Tul Istithmar including under Islamic Export Refinance Scheme and various long term islamic refinancing facilities of the State Bank of Pakistan respectively as briefly explained in note 6.3.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon. The income on such financing is recognised in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah. However, income, if any, received which does not comply with the principles of Islamic Shariah is recognised as charity payable if so directed by the Resident Shariah Board Member (RSBM) of the Bank.

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, Insha'Allah. Therefore, the unconsolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.

# IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular no 3 of 2022, (IFRS) 9, 'Financial Instruments' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 for banks having asset base of more than Rs. 500 billion as at December 31, 2021. SBP via the same circular has finalized the instructions on (IFRS) 9 (Application Instructions) for ensuring smooth and consistent implementation of the standard in the banks.

During 2022, the management of the Bank has performed an impact assessment of (IFRS) 9 taking into account the SBP’s (IFRS) 9 application instructions. The assessment is based on available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Bank at the time of finalizing the impact for initial application of (IFRS) 9. In addition, the Bank will implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments.

An overview of the (IFRS) 9 requirements that are expected to have significant impact are discussed below along with the additional requirements introduced by the SBP:

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will base on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI).

Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealised gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognised.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the income statement.

# 3.6.1 Impairment

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of (IFRS) 9 and SBP’s (IFRS) 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SCIR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilised, stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of (IFRS) 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

# 3.6.2 Presentation and disclosure

(IFRS) 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Bank’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the (IFRS) 9.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The cumulative impact of initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the accounting period. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 and based on this assessment, the Bank does not expect any material effect on the Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and equity as of December 31, 2022.

# 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgments in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of the accounting policies are as follows:

# 6.4 Investments

# 6.4.1 Classification

The Bank classifies its investments as follows:

- Held for trading

These are investments which are either acquired for generating profits from short-term fluctuations in market prices or are securities included in a portfolio for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking.
- Held to maturity

These are investments with fixed or determinable payments and maturity that the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold till maturity.
- Available for sale

These are investments, other than those in associates and subsidiaries, which do not fall under either 'held for trading' or 'held to maturity' categories.
- Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but not control. Certain mutual funds are managed by the subsidiary company of the Bank and hence, the Bank has significant influence over such funds and therefore, investment in these mutual funds are considered as investment in associates in these unconsolidated financial statements.
- Subsidiary

Subsidiary is an entity over which the Bank has control.

# 6.4.2 Regular way contracts

All purchases and sales of investments that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognised at the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the investments.

# Available for sale and Held to maturity investments

Impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale and held to maturity (except sukuk certificates) is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in fair value of an equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. The determination of "significant or prolonged" requires judgment.

Provision for diminution in the value of sukuk certificates is made as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment in available-for-sale investments, the related loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit and loss account for the period. For investments classified as held to maturity, the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 6.5.2 Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Bank determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Bank reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Bank cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised. In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management considers the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

# 6.7 Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

The non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation. The useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. Surplus arising on revaluation of property, if any, is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account in the statement of other comprehensive income. Any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to unconsolidated profit and loss account directly. On derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to unappropriated profit in the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity. Legal fees, transfer cost and direct cost of acquiring title to property is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account.

# 6.8 Deposits

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Mudaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current accounts' and Deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as 'Savings deposits' and 'Fixed deposits'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors, however the funds of current accounts are treated as equity for the purpose of profit calculation and any profit earned / loss incurred on those funds are allocated to the equity of the Bank. While the product features of each product differ, there is usually no restriction on withdrawals or number of transactions in current and savings accounts. In case of fixed deposits, pre-mature withdrawals can be made as per approved terms only. Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio between Rab-ul-Maal and Mudarib. Rab-ul-Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Mudarib can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal up to a maximum of 50% of their profit as Incentive profits (Hiba). Profits are distributed from the pool such that the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments. Asset pools are created at the Bank’s discretion and the Bank can add, amend or transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders.

# 6.9 Sub-ordinated Sukuk

The Bank records sub-ordinated sukuk initially at the amount of proceeds received. Profit accrued on sub-ordinated sukuk is charged to the unconsolidated profit and loss account. These are subsequently measured at amount outstanding.

# 6.10 Pool Management

The Bank operates general and specific pools for deposits and inter-bank funds accepted / acquired under Mudaraba and Musharakah modes. Under the general deposits pools, the Bank accepts funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rab-ul-Maal) where the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. When utilising investing funds, the Bank prioritizes the funds received from depositors over the funds generated from own sources after meeting the regulatory requirement relating to such deposits.

The Bank has made full provision for Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) based on profit for the respective years (2008-2022). In 2016, the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Bank continues to maintain the provision in respect of WWF.

# 24.3 Other contingent liabilities

The Income Tax Department amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2021. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against loans and advances, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches have also been raised. The Bank has obtained stay order from the High Court of Sindh against the demands raised through the amended order for the tax year 2015. Both the Bank and the department have filed appeals with the Appellate Authorities in respect of the aforementioned matters. The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these unconsolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the gratuity liability recognised within the unconsolidated Statement of Financial Position.

# 37.11

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 11.49 years.

# NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the year ended December 31, 2022

# 37.14

Through its Gratuity Funded Scheme, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate sukuk yields; if plan assets underperform to the yield, this will create a deficit. The Fund believes that due to long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the Bank's support, the current investment strategy manages this risk adequately.
- Changes in Sukuk yields: A decrease in corporate sukuk yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' sukuk holdings.
- Inflation risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However plan assets are variable rate instruments and are re-priced at regular intervals to offset inflationary impacts.
- Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate: The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits on severance with the Bank on achieving retirement. Any change in life expectancy / withdrawal rate would impact plan liabilities.

End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme

The Bank also operates an End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme for the founding President and Chief Executive Officer. The charge in respect of current service cost is recognised based on expected period of future service. The net charge for the year of this benefit amounted to Rs 125.56 million. The charge of Rs 67.61 million has been recognized in the Profit and Loss Account and the charge of Rs 57.95 million has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. The present value of defined benefit obligation recognised in respect of this scheme amounts to Rs 529.43 million. The principal actuarial assumptions comprise of discount rate of 14.25 percent and salary increase rate of 8.00 percent. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a one percent change in discount rate would be Rs 10.10 million (in case the discount rate is increased) and Rs 10.40 million (in case the discount rate is decreased). These sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology as explained in note 37.10.

# 41 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 41.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.

Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of Islamic financing and related assets has been made in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.3.2.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.

# 45 CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND ADEQUACY BASEL SPECIFIC

# Capital structure

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced updated guidelines with respect to disclosure of capital adequacy related information in the financial statements of banks vide its communication dated November 5, 2014. These guidelines are based on the requirements of Basel III which were introduced earlier by the SBP in August 2013 for implementation by banks in Pakistan. The SBP had specified a transitional period for implementing new standards which came to its end on December 31, 2019. The disclosures below have been prepared on the basis of these new guidelines. The comparative information is as per requirements which were applicable last year.

# 45.1 Capital structure

Under Basel III framework, the Bank's regulatory capital has been analysed into two tiers as follows:

- Tier 1 capital (going concern capital) which is sub divided into:
- a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), which includes fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, statutory and general reserves, and un-appropriated profits (net of losses), after regulatory deductions for book value of intangibles, reciprocal cross holdings and deficit on revaluation of AFS investments.
- b) Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1), which includes perpetual, unsecured, subordinated, non-cumulative and contingent convertible Sukuk instrument issued by the Bank.
- Tier II capital, which includes sub-ordinated sukuk, general provisions for loan losses (up to a maximum of 1.25% of credit risk weighted assets).

Banking operations are categorised in either the trading book or the banking book and risk weighted assets are determined according to the specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off balance sheet exposures.

The required capital adequacy ratio is achieved by the Bank through:

- (a) Adequate level of paid up capital;
- (b) Adequate risk profile of asset mix;
- (c) Ensuring better recovery management; and
- (d) Maintaining acceptable profit margins.

# 45.2 Capital adequacy ratio

The main objective of the capital management is to improve the financial position and strengthen the statement of financial position of the Bank to support the growth in business, provide protection to depositors and enhance shareholders' value.

The Bank’s Board and the management is committed to maintaining a sound balance between depositors' liability and shareholders' funds so that optimal capital / debt ratio is maintained. The optimal capital / debt ratio will provide reasonable assurance to depositor's about safety and security of their funds and at the same time provide impetus to the management to invest their depositors’ funds into profitable ventures without compromising the risk profile of the Bank. The capital requirement of the Bank has been determined based on the projected growth plan to be achieved in the next 3 years in all areas of business operations. Further, it also takes into account a road map for capital enhancement as directed by the State Bank of Pakistan vide its various circulars issued from time to time.

The Bank prepares Annual Budget and Three Year Plan for purpose of the growth map and future direction. Bottom up approach is used to prepare annual budget and detailed deliberations are held while preparing Three Year Plan. The growth prospects takes into consideration prevailing economic and political factors in Pakistan and abroad.

In implementing current capital requirements the State Bank of Pakistan requires banks to maintain minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50% as of December 31, 2022 whereas CAR stood at 18.42% at the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Bank calculates capital adequacy ratio for credit risk, market risk and operational risk based upon requirements under Basel Accord as per guidelines issued by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time in this regard.

# 47 RISK MANAGEMENT

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global lowered the country’s sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained elevated through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of 27.32% in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to 16%. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

The Bank is regularly conducting assessments of the credit portfolio, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Bank is confident that it has more than sufficient risk bearing capacity to withstand these difficult times.

The wide variety of the Bank’s business activities require the Bank to identify, assess, measure, aggregate and manage risks effectively which are constantly evolving as the business activities expand in response to the Bank's strategy and growth. The Bank manages the risk through a framework of risk management encompassing policies and procedures, organisational structures, risk measurement and monitoring processes and techniques that are closely aligned with business activities of the Bank.

# 47.1 Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability to perform such
obligations is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Bank. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing
activities as well as contingent liabilities.

# Credit risk management and structure

The Bank manages credit risk by effective credit appraisal mechanism, approving and reviewing authorities, limit
structures, internal credit risk rating system, collateral management and post disbursement monitoring so as to ensure
prudent financing activities and sound financing portfolio under the umbrella of a comprehensive Financing Policy
approved by the Board of Directors. A comprehensive financing procedural manual approved by the senior management
is also in place. The Bank also ensures diversification of its portfolio into different business segments, products and
sectors. Further, to avoid risk concentration; counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits
are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

Watchlist procedure is also functioning which identifies financings with early warning indicators in respect of clients having
the potential to become non performing. The risk management function also monitors the non-performing financing
portfolio of the Bank and reports all significant matters to the Board Risk Management Committee.

The Bank takes into account the risk mitigating effect of the eligible collaterals for the calculation of capital requirement for
credit risk. Use of Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) resulted in the total credit risk weighted amount of Rs 557,776.81 million
(2021: Rs 471,179.75 million).

Thus, use of CRM resulted in capital adequacy ratio of the Bank of 18.42%.

# 47.1.2 Credit Risk - General Disclosures

The Bank has adopted Standardised Approach of Basel Accord for calculation of capital charge against credit risk. Therefore, risk weights for the credit risk related assets (on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet - market and non market related exposures) are assigned on basis of standardised approach. The Bank is committed to further strengthen its risk management framework which will enable the Bank to move ahead for adopting Foundation Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach of Basel II. Meanwhile, none of the Bank's assets class is subject to the Foundation IRB or advanced IRB approaches.

# 47.1.2.1 Credit Risk: Disclosures for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach

Under standardised approach the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to the counterparties by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognised by the SBP for capital adequacy purposes. In this connection, the Bank utilises the credit ratings assigned by ECAIs and has recognised agencies such as PACRA (Pakistan Credit Rating Agency) and VIS Credit Rating Company which are also recognised by the SBP. In case of foreign currency exposures against banks, ratings assigned by S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have been applied. In case of exposure against banks, some banks have multiple ratings but those ratings do not result in mapping with different risk weights.

# Use of ECAI Ratings

The Bank prefers solicited ratings over unsolicited ratings at all times, owing to the greater degree of accuracy (in general) associated with solicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings may only be used in cases where a solicited rating is not available.

# Mapping to SBP Rating Grades

The alignment of the Alphanumerical scale of each agency used with risk buckets is as per instructions laid down by SBP under Basel III requirements.

# 47.1.2.3 Credit Risk: Disclosures with respect to Credit risk mitigation for Standardised approach and IRB

The Bank obtains capital relief for both its on-balance and off-balance sheet non-market related exposures by using simple approach for credit risk mitigation (CRM). Off-balance sheet items under the simplified standardised approach are converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors. Under the standardised approach the Bank has taken advantage of the cash collaterals available with the Bank in the form of security deposits, cash margins, certificates of Islamic investment, monthly mudaraba certificate, saving accounts, guarantees, shares and Government securities.

Valuation and management of eligible collaterals for CRM is being done in accordance with the conditions laid down by the State Bank of Pakistan. Eligible collaterals for CRM purposes do not expose the Bank to price risk as they are in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals. Since eligible collaterals for CRM purposes are all in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals, they generally do not pose risk to the Bank in terms of change in their valuation due to changes in the market condition.

The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet market related foreign exchange contracts are determined by using the current exposure (mark to market) method.

The total benefit of Rs 460,703.71 million was availed through CRM against total on-balance sheet exposure of Rs 2,576,920.56 million. Under off-balance sheet, total benefit of Rs 25,942.350 million was availed by the Bank through CRM against total off-balance sheet, non-market related exposure of Rs 1,053,302.06 million. In the year 2022, total CRM benefit was Rs 486,646.05 million as against amount of Rs 577,988.90 million in year 2021.

# 47.1.2.4 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz., industry, geography, and single / group borrower obligor. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Within the SBP limits, the Bank has further defined limits to avoid excessive concentration of portfolio.

The Bank uses a number of methods to monitor and control market risk exposures. One of the major tools used by the Bank to monitor and limit market risk is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is defined as the estimated loss that will arise on a position or a portfolio over a particular (holding) period of time from an adverse market movement with a specific probability (confidence level). The VaR model used by the Bank takes 99% confidence level and assumes a 1 to 10 days holding period whilst using the historical simulation taking the data of the last three years. Daily VaR figures are circulated to the senior management and regular summaries are reported in ALCO meetings.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity, gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 47.2.3 Foreign exchange risk

The foreign exchange risk is defined as the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movement in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency position. The objectives of the foreign exchange risk management is to minimise the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities mismatch (tenor and position) and maximise their earnings.

Whenever a commercial bank deals in foreign currency, it is exposed to risk of exchange rate. The Bank's assets and liabilities in foreign currencies give rise to foreign exchange risk which has to be managed by the Bank; this risk is mitigated by using different hedging techniques. Hedging is a way used by a bank to eliminate or minimize its risk exposures. Hedging can be done using different ways like gap analysis, hedging (forwards), assigning limits in terms of amount, tenor, currency, product, countries, counterparties etc. The Bank limits its currency exposure to the extent of statutory net open position prescribed by the SBP except in the cases where exemption is provided by the SBP. Foreign exchange open and mismatch positions are controlled through close monitoring and are marked to market on a daily basis.

# 47.2.5 Yield / profit rate risk

Yield risk occurs when there is a mismatch between positions, which are subject to profit rate alterations within a particular time period. The Bank’s financing, placement and investment activities give rise to profit rate risk. The effect of changes in profit rate is on the Bank’s income, and resultant impact is on the Bank’s net worth. Profit rate risk is primarily managed by monitoring the rate sensitive gaps and by having the pre-approved limits for repricing buckets. ALCO is the supervising body for adherence with these, complemented by the monitoring of sensitivity of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities to various scenarios.

The Bank estimates changes in the market value of equity due to changes in the yield rates on on-balance sheet positions and their impact on capital adequacy ratio by conducting stress tests. It also assesses risk on earnings of the Bank by various shocks.

# 47.3 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss to the Bank arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund increases in assets as they fall due without incurring an unacceptable cost. The Bank’s Board of Directors sets the Bank’s policy for managing liquidity risk and entrusts accountability for supervision of the implementation of this strategy to senior management. Senior management exercises its responsibilities for managing market & liquidity risk through various committees including the Asset & Liability Management Committee (ALCO). Treasury department manages the Bank’s liquidity position on daily basis. The Bank’s main approach of managing the liquidity risk is to make certain that it will always have adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due in normal and stressed scenarios without incurring any untoward expenditure or risking reputational harm. ALCO monitors the maintenance of liquidity ratios, depositor's concentration both in terms of the overall funding mix and avoidance of undue reliance on large individual deposits. Regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and more severe market conditions.

# 47.4 Operational risk

The Bank uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for assessing the capital charge for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge is calculated by multiplying average positive annual gross income of the Bank over past three years with 15% as per guidelines issued by SBP under Basel II.

To reduce losses arising from operational risk, the Bank has strengthened its risk management framework by developing policies, strategies, guidelines and manuals. It also includes set up of functions like operational risk management, prevention of fraud and forgery and information security function, defining responsibilities of individuals, implementing four eye principle, enhancing security measures, improving efficiency and effectiveness of operations, outsourcing and improving quality of human resources through trainings and development.

# 1. Key Audit Matter

# 1.1 How the matter was addressed in our audit

In addition to the above time-based criteria, the PRs require a subjective evaluation of the credit worthiness of borrowers to determine the classification of Islamic financing and related assets.

The PRs also require the creation of general provision for certain categories of Islamic financing and related assets. The Group has recognised a net provision against Islamic financing and related assets amounting to Rs. 3,249.734 million in the consolidated profit and loss account in the current year. As of December 31, 2022, the Group holds a provision of Rs. 22,593.403 million against Islamic financing and related assets.

The determination of provision against Islamic financing and related assets based on the above criteria remains a significant area of judgement and estimation. Because of the significance of the impact of these judgements and estimations and the materiality of Islamic financing and related assets relative to the overall consolidated financial statements of the Group, we considered the area of provision against Islamic financing and related assets as a key audit matter.

We selected a sample of Islamic financing accounts and performed the following substantive procedures:

- Checked repayments of Islamic financing profit instalments.
- Tested classification of non-performing Islamic financing and related assets based on the number of overdue days.
- Evaluated the management's assessment for classification of a customer's financing facilities as performing or non-performing based on review of repayment pattern, inspection of credit documentation, and thorough discussions with the management.

We checked the accuracy of specific provision made against performing Islamic financing and related assets and of general provision by recomputing the amount of provision as per the requirements of PRs.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# 3. Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern; disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error; and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion: Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error; as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether significant doubt exists on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report; however, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit: We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
- We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence; and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets will base on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which they are held will determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Financial assets can only be held at amortised cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI). Debt instruments where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are held at FVOCI, with unrealised gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognised.

# 3.6 Financial Instruments

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI but both unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account. All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

## Chunk 702


# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of (IFRS) 9 and SBP’s (IFRS) 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of SCIR, Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default.

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilised, stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of (IFRS) 9 ECL or provision computed under existing PRs’ requirements.

# Presentation and disclosure

(IFRS) 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of Holding Company’s disclosure about its financial instruments particularly in the year of adoption of the (IFRS) 9.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Group will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective January 01, 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The cumulative impact of initial application will be recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the accounting period. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial statements in the year 2023 will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Group would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 and based on this assessment, the Group does not expect any material effect on the Group’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and equity as of December 31, 2022.

# 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgments in application of its accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgments were made by the management in the application of the accounting policies are as follows:

# 6.4 Investments

# 6.4.1 Classification

The Group classifies its investments as follows:

- Held for trading: These are investments which are either acquired for generating profits from short-term fluctuations in market prices or are securities included in a portfolio for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking.
- Held to maturity: These are investments with fixed or determinable payments and maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold till maturity.
- Available for sale: These are investments, other than those in associates and subsidiaries, which do not fall under either 'held for trading' or 'held to maturity' categories.
- Associates: Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Certain mutual funds are managed by the subsidiary company of the Group and hence, the Group has significant influence over such funds and therefore, investment in these mutual funds are considered as investment in associates in these consolidated financial statements.

# 6.4 Available for sale

In accordance with the requirements specified by the SBP, quoted securities (other than those classified as 'held to maturity' and 'investments in associates and subsidiary'), are subsequently re-measured to market value. Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. Break-up value of unquoted equity securities is calculated with reference to the net assets of the investee company as per the latest available audited financial statements. Investment in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment losses, if any.

Surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities which are classified as 'available for sale', is included in the Other Comprehensive Income. On derecognition or impairment of available-for-sale investments, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit and loss for the period.

# 6.4.5 Impairment

# Available for sale and Held to maturity investments

Impairment loss in respect of investments classified as available for sale and held to maturity (except sukuk certificates) is recognised based on management's assessment of objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that may have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the investments. A significant or prolonged decline in fair value of an equity investment below its cost is also considered an objective evidence of impairment. The determination of "significant or prolonged" requires judgment.

Provision for diminution in the value of sukuk certificates is made as per the Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP. In case of impairment in available-for-sale investments, the related loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit and loss for period. For investments classified as held to maturity, the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.

# 6.5.2 Right-of-use assets and Lease liabilities

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are presented within note 12 and are subject to impairment in line with the Group’s policy as described in note 6.5.8.

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control that affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental fund acceptance rate to measure lease liabilities.

# Deferred

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the temporary differences relating to initial recognition of goodwill, initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

In making the estimates for current and deferred taxes, the management considers the income tax law and the decisions of appellate authorities on certain issues in the past.

# For the year ended December 31, 2022


The useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. Surplus arising on revaluation of property, if any, is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of assets' account in the statement of other comprehensive income. Any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to consolidated profit and loss account directly. On derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to unappropriated profit in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Legal fees, transfer cost and direct cost of acquiring title to property is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.

# 6.8 Deposits

Deposits are generated on the basis of two modes i.e. Qard and Mudaraba. Deposits taken on Qard basis are classified as 'Current accounts' and Deposits generated on Mudaraba basis are classified as 'Savings deposits' and 'Fixed deposits'. No profit or loss is passed on to current account depositors, however the funds of current accounts are treated as equity for the purpose of profit calculation and any profit earned / loss incurred on those funds are allocated to the equity of the Group. While the product features of each product differ, there is usually no restriction on withdrawals or number of transactions in current and saving accounts. In case of fixed deposits, pre-mature withdrawals can be made as per approved terms only.

Profits realised in investment pools are distributed in pre-agreed profit sharing ratio between Rab-ul-Maal and Mudarib. Rab-ul-Maal share is distributed among depositors according to weightages assigned at the inception of profit calculation period. Mudarib can distribute its share of profit to Rab-ul-Maal up to a maximum of 50% of their profit as Incentive profits (Hiba). Profits are distributed from the pool such that the depositors (remunerative) only bear the risk of assets in the pool during the profit calculation period. In case of loss in a pool during the profit calculation period, the loss is distributed among the depositors (remunerative) according to their ratio of Investments. Asset pools are created at the Group’s discretion and the Group can add, amend or transfer an asset to any other pool in the interests of the deposit holders.

# 6.9 Sub-ordinated Sukuk

The Group records sub-ordinated sukuk initially at the amount of proceeds received. Profit accrued on sub-ordinated sukuk is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account. These are subsequently measured at amount outstanding.

# 6.10 Pool Management

The Group operates general and specific pools for deposits and inter-bank funds accepted / acquired under Mudaraba and Musharakah modes. Under the general deposits pools, the Group accepts funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rab-ul-Maal) where the Group acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in the Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. When utilising investing funds, the Group prioritizes the funds received from depositors over the funds generated from own sources after meeting the regulatory requirement relating to such deposits.

Specific pools are operated for funds acquired / accepted from the State Bank of Pakistan and other banks for Islamic Export Refinance to the Group's customers and liquidity management respectively under the Musharakah / Mudaraba modes. The profit of each deposit pool is calculated on all the remunerative assets booked by utilising the funds from the pool after deduction of expenses directly incurred in earning the income of such pool along with related fee income, if any. The directly related costs comprise of depreciation on ijarah assets, takaful premium, documentation charges etc. No expense of general or administrative nature is charged to the pools. No provision against any non-performing asset of the pool is passed on to the pool except on the actual loss / write-off of such non-performing asset. The profit of the pool is shared between equity and other members of the pool on the basis of Musharakah at gross level (before charging of mudarib fee) as per the investment ratio of the equity. The profit of the pool is shared among the members of the pool on pre-defined mechanism based on the weightages announced before the profit calculation period after charging of mudarib fee. During the year, the Group has given General Hiba to the depositors of Rupee General Pool, keeping in view the prescribed guidelines of Pool Management provided by the SBP and with the approval of the Group's Resident Shariah Board Member. However, Hiba are given at the sole discretion of the Group without any contractual commitment and can be withdrawn or reduced by the Group at its sole discretion.

The risk characteristic of each pool mainly depends on the assets and liabilities profile of each pool. As per the Group's policy, relatively low risk / secured financing transactions and assets are allocated to general depositors pool of Rupee, USD, GBP and Euro. The Group maintains General Pools (Rupee, USD, EUR, GBP), FI Pools, IERS pool and Equity pool. The general pools are exposed to general credit risk, asset ownership risk and profit rate risk of the underlying assets involved.

# 20.8

The Group has made full provision for Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) based on profit for the respective years (2008-2022). In 2016, the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Group continues to maintain the provision in respect of WWF.

# 25.3 Other contingent liabilities

# 25.3.1 Holding Company:

The Income Tax Department amended the deemed assessment orders of the Holding Company for prior years including the tax year 2021. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against loans and advances, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches have also been raised. The Holding Company has obtained stay order from the High Court of Sindh against the demands raised through the amended order for the tax year 2015. Both the Holding Company and the department have filed appeals with the Appellate Authorities in respect of the aforementioned matters.

The management of the Holding Company, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Holding Company’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

Through its Gratuity Funded Scheme, the Fund is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

- Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate sukuk yields; if plan assets underperform to the yield, this will create a deficit. The Fund believes that due to long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the Bank's support, the current investment strategy manages this risk adequately.
- Changes in Sukuk yields: A decrease in corporate sukuk yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' sukuk holdings.
- Inflation risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However plan assets are variable rate instruments and are re-priced at regular intervals to offset inflationary impacts.
- Life expectancy / Withdrawal rate: The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits on severance with the Holding Company on achieving retirement. Any change in life expectancy / withdrawal rate would impact plan liabilities.

# 38.15 Meezan Bank End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme

The Holding Company also operates an End of Service Unfunded Defined Benefit Scheme for the founding President and Chief Executive Officer.

The charge in respect of current service cost is recognised based on expected period of future service. The net charge for the year of this benefit amounted to Rs 125.56 million. The charge of Rs 67.61 million has been recognised in the consolidated Profit and Loss Account and the charge of Rs 57.95 million has been recognised in Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income. The present value of defined benefit obligation recognised in respect of this scheme amounts to Rs 529.43 million.

The principal actuarial assumptions comprise of discount rate of 14.25 percent and salary increase rate of 8.00 percent. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a one percent change in discount rate would be Rs 10.10 million (in case the discount rate is increased) and Rs 10.40 million (in case the discount rate is decreased). These sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology as explained in note 38.10.

# 42 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 42.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2022


The Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year. Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of Islamic financing and related assets has been made in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.3.2. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.

# CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND ADEQUACY BASEL SPECIFIC

# Capital structure

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced updated guidelines with respect to disclosure of capital adequacy related information in the financial statements of banks vide its communication dated November 5, 2014. These guidelines are based on the requirements of Basel III which were introduced earlier by the SBP in August 2013 for implementation by banks in Pakistan. The SBP had specified a transitional period for implementing new standards which came to its end on December 31, 2019. The disclosures below have been prepared on the basis of these new guidelines. The comparative information is as per requirements which were applicable last year.

# 46.1 Capital structure

Under Basel III framework, the Holding Company's regulatory capital has been analysed into two tiers as follows:

- Tier 1 capital (going concern capital) which is sub divided into:
- a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), which includes fully paid up capital, balance in share premium account, statutory and general reserves, and un-appropriated profits (net of losses), after regulatory deductions for book value of intangibles, reciprocal cross holdings and deficit on revaluation of AFS investments.
- b) Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1), which includes perpetual, unsecured, subordinated, non-cumulative and contingent convertible Sukuk instrument issued by the Holding Company.
- Tier II capital, which includes sub-ordinated sukuk, general provisions for loan losses (up to a maximum of 1.25% of credit risk weighted assets).

Banking operations are categorised in either the trading book or the banking book and risk weighted assets are determined according to the specified requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off balance sheet exposures.

The required capital adequacy ratio is achieved by the Holding Company through:

- (a) Adequate level of paid up capital;
- (b) Adequate risk profile of asset mix;
- (c) Ensuring better recovery management; and
- (d) Maintaining acceptable profit margins.

# 46.2 Capital adequacy ratio

The main objective of the capital management is to improve the financial position and strengthen the statement of financial position of the Group to support the growth in business, provide protection to depositors and enhance shareholders' value.

The Holding Company's Board and the management is committed to maintaining a sound balance between depositors' liability and shareholders' funds so that optimal capital / debt ratio is maintained. The optimal capital / debt ratio will provide reasonable assurance to depositor's about safety and security of their funds and at the same time provide impetus to the management to invest their depositors’ funds into profitable ventures without compromising the risk profile of the Holding Company.

The capital requirement of the Holding Company has been determined based on the projected growth plan to be achieved in the next 3 years in all areas of business operations. Further, it also takes into account a road map for capital enhancement as directed by the State Bank of Pakistan vide its various circulars issued from time to time.

The Holding Company prepares Annual Budget and Three Year Plan for purpose of the growth map and future direction. Bottom up approach is used to prepare annual budget and detailed deliberations are held while preparing Three Year Plan. The growth prospects takes into consideration prevailing economic and political factors in Pakistan and abroad.

In implementing current capital requirements the State Bank of Pakistan requires banks to maintain minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 11.50% as of December 31, 2022 whereas CAR stood at 18.64% at the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Group calculates capital adequacy ratio for credit risk, market risk and operational risk based upon requirements under Basel Accord as per guidelines issued by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to time in this regard.

Sensitivity and stress testing of the Holding Company under different risk factors namely profit rate, non-performing financings, equity price and foreign exchange rate depicts that the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio is above the regulatory requirements.

The Group has taken into account credit risk, market risk and operational risk when planning its assets.

# 48 RISK MANAGEMENT

During 2022, Pakistan witnessed significant economic headwinds. Rising inflation, increasing fuel prices, depleting foreign exchange reserves, massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, political instability, increasing interest rates, and high budget deficit made the year more challenging. In this backdrop, Fitch, Moody's and S&P Global lowered the country’s sovereign credit rating. In June 2022, Pakistan was hit with a natural catastrophe in the shape of worst ever floods in the history of the country. The floods resulted in millions of people being displaced and severe damage to both crops and livestock. Additionally, international commodity prices also remained elevated through the year. The headline inflation increased significantly touching a multi-year high of 27.32% in August. During the year, SBP increased the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 625 bps to 16%. This steep increase was aimed at reducing aggregate demand in the economy and also to counter high inflation. This led to a steep uptick in domestic food prices.

The Group is regularly conducting assessments of the credit portfolio, with robust post disbursement credit review mechanism to identify borrowers most likely to be affected in the challenging business and economic environment. Group is confident that it has more than sufficient risk bearing capacity to withstand these difficult times.

The wide variety of the Group’s business activities require the Group to identify, assess, measure, aggregate and manage risks effectively which are constantly evolving as the business activities expand in response to the Group's strategy and growth. The Group manages the risk through a framework of risk management encompassing policies and procedures, organisational structures, risk measurement and monitoring processes and techniques that are closely aligned with business activities of the Group.

Credit risk arises from the potential that an obligor is either unwilling to perform on an obligation or its ability to perform such obligations is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Group. This credit risk arises mainly from both direct financing activities as well as contingent liabilities.

# Credit risk management and structure

The Group manages credit risk by effective credit appraisal mechanism, approving and reviewing authorities, limit structures, internal credit risk rating system, collateral management and post disbursement monitoring so as to ensure prudent financing activities and sound financing portfolio under the umbrella of a comprehensive Financing Policy approved by the Board of Directors. A comprehensive financing procedural manual approved by the senior management is also in place. The Group also ensures diversification of its portfolio into different business segments, products and sectors. Further, to avoid risk concentration; counterparty limits, counterparty group limits and industry concentration limits are also established, monitored and assessed in the light of changing counterparty and market conditions.

Watchlist procedure is also functioning which identifies financings with early warning indicators in respect of clients having the potential to become non performing. The risk management function also monitors the non-performing financing portfolio of the Group and reports all significant matters to the Board Risk Management Committee.

The Group takes into account the risk mitigating effect of the eligible collaterals for the calculation of capital requirement for credit risk. Use of Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) resulted in the total credit risk weighted amount of Rs 557,711.43 million (2021: Rs 471,199.11 million). Thus, use of CRM resulted in capital adequacy ratio of the Group of 18.64%.

# 48.1.2 Credit Risk - General Disclosures

The Group has adopted Standardised Approach of Basel Accord for calculation of capital charge against credit risk. Therefore, risk weights for the credit risk related assets (on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet - market and non market related exposures) are assigned on basis of standardised approach. The Group is committed to further strengthen its risk management framework which will enable the Group to move ahead for adopting Foundation Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach of Basel II. Meanwhile, none of the Group's assets class is subject to the Foundation IRB or advanced IRB approaches.

# 48.1.2.1 Credit Risk: Disclosures for portfolio subject to the Standardised Approach

Under standardised approach the capital requirement is based on the credit rating assigned to the counterparties by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) duly recognised by the SBP for capital adequacy purposes. In this connection, the Group utilises the credit ratings assigned by ECAIs and has recognised agencies such as PACRA (Pakistan Credit Rating Agency) and VIS Credit Rating Company which are also recognised by the SBP. In case of foreign currency exposures against banks, ratings assigned by S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have been applied. In case of exposure against banks, some banks have multiple ratings but those ratings do not result in mapping with different risk weights.

# Use of ECAI Ratings

The Group prefers solicited ratings over unsolicited ratings at all times, owing to the greater degree of accuracy (in general) associated with solicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings may only be used in cases where a solicited rating is not available.

# Mapping to SBP Rating Grades

The alignment of the Alphanumerical scale of each agency used with risk buckets is as per instructions laid down by SBP under Basel III requirements.

# 48.1.2.3 Credit Risk: Disclosures with respect to Credit risk mitigation for Standardised approach and IRB

The Group obtains capital relief for both its on-balance and off-balance sheet non-market related exposures by using simple approach for credit risk mitigation (CRM). Off-balance sheet items under the simplified standardised approach are converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors. Under the standardised approach the Group has taken advantage of the cash collaterals available with the Group in the form of security deposits, cash margins, certificates of islamic investment, monthly mudaraba certificate, saving accounts, guarantees, shares and Government securities.

Valuation and management of eligible collaterals for CRM is being done in accordance with the conditions laid down by the State Bank of Pakistan. Eligible collaterals for CRM purposes do not expose the Group to price risk as they are in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals. Since eligible collaterals for CRM purposes are all in the form of cash/cash equivalent collaterals, they generally do not pose risk to the Group in terms of change in their valuation due to changes in the market condition.

The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet market related foreign exchange contracts are determined by using the current exposure (mark to market) method.

The total benefit of Rs 460,703.70 million was availed through CRM against total on-balance sheet exposure of Rs 2,578,068.91 million. Under off-balance sheet, total benefit of Rs 25,942.35 million was availed by the Group through CRM against total off-balance sheet, non-market related exposure of Rs 1,053,302.06 million. In the year 2022, total CRM benefit was Rs 486,646.053 million as against amount of Rs 577,988.895 million in year 2021.

# 48.1.2.4 Credit concentration risk

Credit concentration risk arises mainly due to concentration of exposures under various categories viz., industry, geography and single / group borrower obligor. Within credit portfolio, as a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of risks, the SBP has prescribed regulatory limits on banks’ maximum exposure to single and group obligors. Within the SBP limits, the Group has further defined limits to avoid excessive concentration of portfolio.

The Group uses a number of methods to monitor and control market risk exposures. One of the major tools used by the Group to monitor and limit market risk is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is defined as the estimated loss that will arise on a position or a portfolio over a particular (holding) period of time from an adverse market movement with a specific probability (confidence level). The VaR model used by the Group takes 99% confidence level and assumes a 1 to 10 days holding period whilst using the historical simulation taking the data of the last three years. Daily VaR figures are circulated to the senior management and regular summaries are reported in ALCO meetings.

The VaR reports are complemented by various other position and sensitivity limit structures, including stress, sensitivity, gap and scenario analysis. The capital charge for market risk has been calculated by using Standardized Approach.

# 48.2.3 Foreign exchange risk

The foreign exchange risk is defined as the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. It refers to the impact of adverse movement in currency exchange rates on the value of open foreign currency position. The objectives of the foreign exchange risk management is to minimise the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities mismatch (tenor and position) and maximise their earnings.

Whenever a commercial bank deals in foreign currency, it is exposed to risk of exchange rate. The Group's assets and liabilities in foreign currencies give rise to foreign exchange risk which has to be managed by the Group; this risk is mitigated by using different hedging techniques. Hedging is a way used by a Group to eliminate or minimize its risk exposures. Hedging can be done using different ways like gap analysis, hedging (forwards), assigning limits in terms of amount, tenor, currency, product, countries, counterparties etc. The Group limits its currency exposure to the extent of statutory net open position prescribed by the SBP except in the cases where exemption is provided by the SBP. Foreign exchange open and mismatch positions are controlled through close monitoring and are marked to market on a daily basis.

The analysis below represents the concentration of the Group's foreign currency risk for on and off balance sheet financial instruments:

# 48.2.5 Yield / profit rate risk

Yield risk occurs when there is a mismatch between positions, which are subject to profit rate alterations within a particular time period. The Group’s financing, placement and investment activities give rise to profit rate risk. The effect of changes in profit rate is on the Group’s income, and resultant impact is on the Group’s net worth. Profit rate risk is primarily managed by monitoring the rate sensitive gaps and by having the pre-approved limits for repricing buckets. ALCO is the supervising body for adherence with these, complemented by the monitoring of sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to various scenarios.

The Group estimates changes in the market value of equity due to changes in the yield rates on on-balance sheet positions and their impact on capital adequacy ratio by conducting stress tests. It also assesses risk on earnings of the Group by various shocks.

# 48.3 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss to the Group arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund
increases in assets as they fall due without incurring an unacceptable cost.

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors sets the Group’s policy for managing liquidity risk and entrusts
accountability for supervision of the implementation of this strategy to senior management. Senior management
exercises its responsibilities for managing market & liquidity risk through various committees including the Asset
& Liability Management Committee (ALCO). Treasury department manages the Group’s liquidity position on a daily
basis. The Group’s main approach to managing the liquidity risk is to make certain that it will always have adequate
liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due in normal and stressed scenarios without incurring any untoward
expenditure or risking reputational harm. ALCO monitors the maintenance of liquidity ratios, depositor's concentration
both in terms of the overall funding mix and avoidance of undue reliance on large individual deposits. Regular
liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and more severe market
conditions.

# 48.4 Operational risk

The Group uses Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for assessing the capital charge for operational risk. Under BIA the capital charge is calculated by multiplying average positive annual gross income of the Group over past three years with 15% as per guidelines issued by SBP under Basel II.

To reduce losses arising from operational risk, the Group has strengthened its risk management framework by developing policies, strategies, guidelines and manuals. It also includes set up of functions like operational risk management, prevention of fraud and forgery and information security function, defining responsibilities of individuals, implementing four eye principle, enhancing security measures, improving efficiency and effectiveness of operations, outsourcing and improving quality of human resources through trainings and development.
