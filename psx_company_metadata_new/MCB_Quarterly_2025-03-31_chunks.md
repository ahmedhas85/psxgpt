MCB reported a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 29.3 billion and Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 13.8 billion for Q1 2025, translating into Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 11.65. On a consolidated basis, PBT stood at Rs. 31.6 billion. These results underscore Bank's prudent approach towards balance sheet management, relentless focus on core banking fundamentals, and disciplined risk framework.

The net interest income declined by 7.6% year-on-year on account of narrowing margins in a normalized interest rate environment. However, non-markup income remained resilient at Rs. 9.2 billion, slightly up from Rs. 9.1 billion in the corresponding period last year. Fee and commission income stood at Rs. 5.3 billion, while foreign exchange income and dividend income contributed Rs. 2.2 billion and Rs. 1.7 billion, respectively. The Bank's continued investment in digital channels and process optimization enhanced both customer convenience and operational efficiency.

Operating expenses increased by 22% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments in talent, technology and marketing. However, the cost-to-income ratio remained efficient at 38.23%, reflecting disciplined financial management on Bank's part amidst continued investment in innovation and talent development.

Total assets grew by 17% over December 31, 2024 to reach Rs. 3.2 trillion as at March 31, 2025. This growth was primarily led by a 56% increase in net investments (Rs. 658 billion), while gross advances decreased by 26% (Rs. 284 billion), in line with a measured approach to lending amid evolving macroeconomic dynamics.

The Bank crossed a significant milestone of Rs. 1 trillion in current account deposits, raising the CA ratio to 51% as at March 31, 2025. Deposits reported at Rs. 2.09 trillion, reflecting a 9% increase and strengthening MCB's domestic market share to 6.04% (up from 5.74% as at December 31, 2024). The domestic cost of deposits dropped significantly to 5.51%, compared to 10.70% in Q1 2024, supporting overall margin management.

MCB's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) were reported at 1.88% and 24.12%, respectively, while book value per share stood at Rs. 194.82. As a leading player in the remittance segment, MCB recorded USD 1,169 million in home remittance inflows during the quarter, reflecting a 31% year-on-year growth. The Bank continues to support the State Bank of Pakistan's efforts to promote formal remittance channels and financial inclusion.

Asset quality remained strong, with Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) reporting at Rs. 53.5 billion, and coverage and infection ratios at 94.13% and 6.61%, respectively. These metrics reinforce MCB's effective credit risk governance and diversified lending approach.

MCB maintained a robust capital position, with a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 19.10%, and a Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) ratio of 15.32%, significantly above regulatory thresholds. The Leverage Ratio stood at 6.18%, while liquidity indicators remained strong with Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at 252.37% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at 139.24%, both comfortably above the 100% regulatory requirement.

The Board of Directors has declared first interim cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90% for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, MCB Bank remains committed to delivering long-term stakeholder value through sound financial stewardship, customer-centric innovation, and operational excellence.

# Economic Review

The first quarter of 2025 witnessed heightened volatility across global markets, shaped by geopolitical risks and trade policy uncertainties. Protectionist measures, particularly the trade tariffs, exacerbated market fragility, while political polarization in key economies further clouded the outlook. An initial rally in equities, fueled by post-U.S. presidential election optimism, proved short-lived as renewed trade tensions triggered a sharp correction.

Commodity markets mirrored this turbulence, with oil prices facing sustained downward pressure due to subdued demand and expanded OPEC+ production. Gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset, gained traction amid periods of heightened market uncertainty.

While geopolitical developments, including potential de-escalation in Eastern Europe, provided intermittent relief, broader concerns over trade fragmentation and its implications for global growth dominated investor sentiment. Amid this uncertain global backdrop, Pakistan's economy demonstrated notable stability, supported by successful engagement with the IMF and disciplined fiscal management. The IMF and Pakistan reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) following the first review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Additionally, the IMF approved a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) of USD 1.3 billion for 28 months. Investor confidence strengthened, as evidenced by the bullish performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange.

Inflationary pressures receded significantly, aided by declining food and energy prices. Inflation in Pakistan fell to a low of 0.7% in March 2025, with an average inflation rate of 5.25% for the fiscal year 2025. Fiscal consolidation measures have yielded positive results, showing improvements in fiscal accounts during the first half of the fiscal year FY2025; the fiscal deficit being recorded at 1.2% of GDP. Similarly, the primary surplus increased to Rs. 3,604 billion (2.9% of GDP). The external account position has strengthened, driven by a continued increase in exports and a notable rise in remittances, despite an upward trend in imports. From July to March FY2025, the current account posted a surplus of USD 1,859 million, compared to a deficit of USD 1,652 million last year.

However, structural challenges persist. Revenue shortfalls remain a concern, progress on state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms has been sluggish, and circular debt in the energy sector continues to weigh on fiscal sustainability, despite efforts to renegotiate contracts with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The State Bank of Pakistan's decision to maintain the policy rate at 12% reflects a cautious stance, balancing inflation expectations against growth objectives, with further easing contingent on sustained price stability, particularly in core inflation.

# Future Outlook

The risk of a synchronized global downturn has risen materially, with trade policy serving as a critical swing factor.

According to the IMF, the U.S. dollar's share of global reserves declined to 58% in 2024, down from over 70% two decades ago, as investors diversified into alternative currencies and safe-haven assets. This shift signals a gradual reconfiguration of the international monetary order, though its implications for trade and capital flows remain uncertain.

Market trajectories in the coming quarters will hinge on the interplay of trade policies among major economies, technological disruption, and divergent monetary policy paths. The potential for slower growth and persistent inflationary pressures continues to drive portfolio repositioning among global investors.

The IMF has revised Pakistan's GDP growth projection downward to 2.6% for fiscal year 2025, down from its previous estimate of 3%, while forecasting 4% growth for fiscal year 2026. The revision reflects weak cotton output and subdued industrial performance. While Pakistan's near-term fundamentals appear stable, realizing durable growth requires addressing persistent vulnerabilities. Prioritizing revenue mobilization, accelerating SOEs privatization, and resolving energy sector inefficiencies would enhance resilience against external shocks. The anticipated moderation in inflation could provide room for further monetary easing, contingent on sustained fiscal discipline. External risks, including commodity price volatility and geopolitical spillovers, warrant vigilant macroeconomic management.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

2.1 These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements represent separate financial statements of MCB Bank Limited. The consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Group are being issued separately.

2.2 In accordance with the directives of the Federal Government regarding the shifting of the banking system to Islamic modes, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued various circulars from time to time. Permissible forms of trade-related modes of financing include purchase of goods by banks from their customers and immediate resale to them at appropriate profit in price on deferred payment basis. The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilized and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

2.3 The unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pak Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency of its primary economic environment. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand.

2.4 These unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that certain classes of property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are stated at revalued amounts; investments classified at fair value through profit and loss and fair value through other comprehensive income; foreign exchange contracts and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; defined benefit obligations are carried at present value; right of use of asset and related lease liability are measured at present value on initial recognition; and staff loans and subsidised loans disbursed under Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) are measured at fair value on initial recognition.

2.5 The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.

Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgment may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Bank maintained its provision in respect of WWF.

# 25.4 Taxation

For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2024, the tax department disputed Bank's treatment on certain issues, where the Bank's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 2,632.390 million (2024: Rs. 2,632.390 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance / deducted at source.

The Bank has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Bank are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Bank's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The table below analyses the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in debt and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of property and equipment (land and building) & non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims.

Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates (the "Group").

a. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based on the financial statements for the three months period ended March 31, 2025 and the carrying value of investments held by the parent is eliminated against the subsidiaries' shareholders' equity in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. Material intra-Group balances and transactions have also been eliminated.

b. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter adjusted for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

c. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

# 23.1 Under IFRS 3 a bargain purchase represents an economic gain which should be immediately recognized by the acquirer as income.

However, the amount of bargain purchase gain has not been taken to the profit and loss account as the SBP, through its letter BPRD(R&PD)/2017/14330 dated June 13, 2017 recommended that the amount of gain may be routed directly into equity as a Non-distributable Capital Reserve (NCR). The NCR may become available for distribution through a stock dividend only with prior approval of the SBP. The Holding Company, before distribution of the gain as a stock dividend, may adjust any subsequent provisions / deficit, assessed by the Bank or recommended by the Banking Inspection Department of SBP, in the acquired assets and liabilities of NIB Bank Limited against the NCR.

|        | For assessment year 1999-2000 through tax year 2024, the tax department disputed Group's treatment on certain issues, where the Group's appeals are pending at various appellate forums, entailing an additional tax liability of Rs. 2,632.390 million (2024: 2,632.390 million). Such issues inter alia principally include disallowance of expenses for non deduction of withholding tax and non availability of underlying records, provision for non performing loans, attribution of expenses to heads of income other than income from business and disallowance of credit for taxes paid in advance / deducted at source. |                           |
|        | The Group has filed appeals which are pending at various appellate forums. In addition, certain decisions made in favour of the Group are being contested by the department at higher forums. No provision has been made in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements regarding the aforesaid additional tax demand and already issued favourable decisions where the department is in appeal, as the management is of the view that the issues will be decided in the Bank's favour as and when these are taken up by the Appellate Authorities.                                                                 |                           |
