# Economic Update

The Pakistani authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached a staff level agreement to complete the combined 7th and 8th reviews for Pakistan’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF). This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board, which is scheduled to meet on August 24, 2022, making USD 1,177 million (SDR 894 million) available for Islamabad. The Monetary Policy Committee in its meeting held on July 7, 2022 has raised the policy rate by 125 basis points to 15.00%, citing a need for soft landing of the economy amid an exceptionally challenging and uncertain global environment. This monetary tightening should help cool economic activity, prevent a de-anchoring of inflationary expectations and provide support to the Rupee in the wake of multi-year high inflation and record imports.

The average inflation for Fiscal Year ’22 (FY ‘22) stood at 12.2% as monthly reading for June clocked in at 21.32%. SBP projects inflation to be between 18-20% in FY ‘23. Externally, Bloomberg Commodity Index has fallen by 15.46% to 116.45 from its all-time highs in early June primarily due to actions taken by central banks of major economies to tame inflation.

As per the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the trade deficit for FY ‘22 widened to USD 44.77 billion where exports increased by 24.8% to USD 39.42 billion while imports rose by 34.2% to USD 84.19 billion. In FY ‘22, workers’ remittances remained resilient as they reached USD 31.24 billion, a year-on-year increase of 6.1%. The Current Account posted a deficit of USD 17.4.


Half Year June 30, 2022



billion for FY ‘22. Due to the political and economic uncertainties, the USD/PKR parity depreciated to 204.85 from 157.87, i.e., a depreciation of 29.76% in FY ‘22. As of quarter end, SBP reserves were down to USD 9,816 million, their lowest level since November ‘19.

Inflationary pressures continue to be the major concern facing the global economy due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in addition to ongoing supply chain constraints from the pandemic. The IMF has stated that the global economic growth may slow down to 3.2% this year from an estimated 5.5% in 2021, due to concerns about the Russia-Ukraine conflict and aggressive central banks’ actions. Looking ahead for Pakistan, heightened uncertainty about domestic politics and depleting foreign exchange reserves have meant that Pakistan’s Eurobonds continue to remain under pressure, despite the government managing to sign a Staff Level Agreement with the IMF. After significant depreciation of the Pakistan Rupee, the S&P Global Ratings also revised the outlook on Pakistan’s long-term ratings to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’. The expectation is that Pakistan’s credit spreads will start to narrow, and USD/PKR parity will stabilize once the funds become available from IMF, bilateral and multilateral sources. This will ease pressure on SBP reserves while settling any default concerns, thus dampening volatility in money, foreign exchange and stock markets.

# To the members of Faysal Bank Limited

# On review of Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of Faysal Bank Limited (the Bank) as at June 30, 2022 and the related condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed interim unconsolidated cash flow statement, and notes to the financial statements for the six-month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review. The figures for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 in the condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income have not been reviewed and we do not express a conclusion on them.

## Chunk 13


# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Noman Abbas Sheikh.

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these standards and amendments on the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.

* The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has deferred the applicability of IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and has also issued detailed application guidelines for implementation of IFRS 9. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than 'incurred credit losses' approach. The ECL has an impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is currently being assessed based on the detailed application guidelines issued by the SBP.

| 22.3.1 | Income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalised upto the tax year 2020 (accounting year ended December 31, 2019). Income tax return for tax year 2021 (accounting year ended December 31, 2020) has already been filed by the Bank within stipulated timeline. The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) \[CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability. However, the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter. |           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |
| 22.4   | There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 29,736 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages. Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.                                                              |           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |
| 22.5   | Commitments to extend credits The Bank makes commitments to extend credit (including to related parties) in the normal course of its business but these being revocable commitments do not attract any significant penalty or expense if the facilities are unilaterally withdrawn except for Rs. 15,203 million (December 2021: Rs. 31,655 million) which are irrevocable in nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |

# 34 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

| Fixed assets (land and buildings)                     | Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021. |
| Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.                 |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

The purchases and sales arising under these arrangements are not reflected in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements as such but are restricted to the amount of facility actually utilised and the appropriate portion of profit thereon.

# 3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Company from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Company by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Company in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

| Standards, interpretations or amendments                                                 | Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after) |

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these standards and amendments on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

* The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has deferred the applicability of IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and has also issued detailed application guidelines for implementation of IFRS 9. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than 'incurred credit losses' approach. The ECL has an impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is currently being assessed based on the detailed application guidelines issued by the SBP.

(i) Income tax assessments of the Holding Company have been finalised up to the tax year 2020 (accounting year 2019). Income tax return for TY 2021 (accounting year 2020) has been filed within stipulated timeline. The department and the Holding Company has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] has deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department has filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). Recently, ATIR has passed an order and maintained the decision of CIR(A) in favor of Holding Company, confirming that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.

(ii) There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 29,736 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Holding Company from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Holding Company was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Holding Company for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Holding Company's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Holding Company for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessments, management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Holding Company's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Holding Company is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

The management is of the view that WWF was not applicable for tax year 2008. In tax year 2013, subsequent to clarification decision by the SHC, the management has not admitted WWF charge in the annual return of income. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iii) The Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice No.PRA/AM/61/2205/ dated March 12, 2014 to Faysal Asset Management Limited requiring the Subsidiary Company to obtain registration / enrolment and to pay sales tax amounting to Rs. 6.055 million from July 2013 to March 2014 under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 with effect from May 22, 2013 on management fee earned in Punjab. In respect of this, the Subsidiary Company, jointly with other Asset Management Companies together with their respective collective investment schemes through their trustees, has filed a petition on July 8, 2014 in the SHC challenging the above notice. The Court has ordered suspension of the show cause notice till the next hearing of appeal in their order dated July 10, 2014. The next date of hearing has not yet been decided. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iv) During the prior period, the audit of the tax year 2013 (financial year ended June 30, 2013) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 4.964 million for the tax year 2013 on account of apportionment of expenses, salary expenses and hardware and software expense. The management filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. The CIR(A) remanded back a few expenses while ordered against various other expenses for which the Subsidiary Company has decided to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(v) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.673 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(vi) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) has passed an order under section 182(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax year 2018, whereby the DCIR has imposed a penalty of Rs. 0.833 million on account of non submission of statement required to be filed by the Subsidiary Company under bilateral or multilateral convention under section 165B of the Income Tax Ordinance.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

# Level 3: Fair value measurements

Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

| Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31 2021. The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. |
