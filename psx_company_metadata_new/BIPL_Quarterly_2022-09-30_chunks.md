# Economic Snapshot

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) subsequent to an increase of 125 bps in policy rate during July 2022, decided to maintain the policy rate at 15% in its meetings held in August and October 2022. The decision was mainly backed by deceleration in economic activity as well as decline in inflation and Current Account Deficit (CAD). As per MPC, in view of recent floods in the country, current policy rate would provide a balance between managing inflationary pressure and maintaining economic growth.

Due to recent administrative reduction in electricity prices, inflation has reduced to 23.2% in Sep 2022. Moving forward, the impact of floods is expected to be felt in food prices, due to which inflation would climb higher than the pre-flood projection of 18%-20% for FY2023.

Trade deficit reduced to USD 2.9 Bn, a 30.6% decrease on YoY basis, due to: (a) decline in both energy and non-energy imports, which stood at around USD 16.3 Bn during the third quarter of FY2022; and (b) stability in exports, which were at USD 7.0 Bn. Looking ahead, the impact on CAD is expected to be muted, as post-floods food imports are likely to increase and export of rice and textile are also expected to drop. However, the pressure on CAD might subside to certain extent due to decrease in pressure on imports, owing to slowdown in domestic demand, falling global commodity prices and shipping costs.

On account of increase in global commodity prices, higher demand and pressure on import bills, FX reserves of the country declined from USD 23.9 Bn in December 2021 to USD 13.6 Bn in September 2022. Consequently, USD-PKR parity remained under pressure and closed at Rs. 228.45 at the end of September 2022. Later, PKR gained strength and in October 2022 exchange rate recovered to Rs. 219.71 (October 18, 2022). Given secured external financing and additional commitments in the wake of the floods, FX reserves is expected to improve through the course of the year.

Based on the foregoing, GDP growth of the country is expected to decrease to around 2% in FY23 against the previous forecast of 3%-4%.

# Quarterly Report September 2022

With the increase in policy rates and various regulatory initiatives taken by GoP and SBP to contain imports, the growth in consumer financing remained under pressure, but still the Bank was able to grow its Islamic Financing Portfolio (net) by 13.3% since December 2021 and by 31.9% as compared to same period last year. Infection ratio has improved to 8.1% as compared to 8.7% as at December 31, 2021. As a matter of prudence, the Bank took additional general provision of Rs. 1.65 Bn during nine months against potential losses in financing portfolio due to which coverage ratio has improved from 90% as at December 31, 2021 to 97%. On the investment front, the Bank placed its surplus liquidity towards GoP Ijarah Sukuk to close its investment portfolio at Rs. 205.3 Bn, depicting growth of 11.6% in investment portfolio since December 2021. Due to improvement in overall quality of assets portfolio and profitability, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) clocked at 15.92% as compared to 14.15% as at December 31, 2021.

Owing to growth in overall balance sheet along with rise in policy rate, the net spread earned of the Bank during nine months ended September 2022 grew by 69.1% as compared to same period last year. Non-funded income of the Bank also registered a growth of 93.2% as compared to same period last year. With country going through a high cycle of inflation, the Bank announced a monthly inflation allowance for its low and middle cadre staff to provide a measure of relief to them in these testing times; it’s a proof of Bank’s commitment to take care of its employees’ well-being. Due to higher inflationary impact, expansion in its branch network, increase in headcount primarily on business side and increase in marketing activities, the overall operating expenses of the Bank has increased by 25.7% as compared to same period last year.

Based on growth in net profit/return together with higher non-funded income, the Bank registered 193.8% increase in operating profit as compared to same period last year and closed at Rs. 7.8 Bn. Net provisioning for nine months against the non-performing financing of the Bank stood at Rs. 2.2 Bn. Resultantly, the Bank posted profit after tax of Rs. 2.85 Bn which is 53.8% higher than profit after tax for the same period last year, Alhamdulillah.

13.1 The Bank has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 4,274.914 million as at September 30, 2022 (2021: Rs.7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Bank would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs.1,496.220 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Bank, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realisability of the deferred tax asset.

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

Basis of Consolidation

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Holding Company and the financial statements of subsidiary companies from the date that control of the subsidiary by the Holding Company commences until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiary companies, other than those classified as 'Held for Sale' (refer note 15), are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by The Holding Company is eliminated against the corresponding share capital of subsidiaries in these consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of all material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company, except for non-banking subsidiaries in Pakistan which follow the requirements of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, IAS 40: Investment Property and IFRS - 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which are required to comply with local regulations enforced within the respective jurisdictions. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated. Associates are those entities in which the Holding Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Holding Company has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

# 13.1

The Holding Company has aggregate tax losses of Rs. 4,274.914 million as at September 30, 2022 (2021: Rs. 7,403.539 million) which includes tax losses of amalgamated entity. The management has carried out an assessment for estimating the benefit of these losses. The Holding Company would be able to set off the profit earned in future years against these carry forward losses. Based on this assessment the management has recognized deferred tax debit balance amounting to Rs. 1,496.220 million (2021: Rs. 2,591.239 million). The amount of this benefit has been determined based on the projected financial statements for the future periods as approved by the management. The determination of future taxable profit is most sensitive to certain key assumptions such as cost to income ratio of the Holding Company, deposit's composition, kibor rates, growth of deposits and financing, investment returns, product mix of financing, potential provision against assets / financings, recoveries from non-performing financing and branch expansion plan. Any significant change in the key assumptions may have an effect on the realizability of the deferred tax asset.

# 32.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Holding Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial assets measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:
