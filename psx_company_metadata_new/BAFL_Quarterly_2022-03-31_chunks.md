## Chunk 6


# Economic Review

The year started with geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine conflict), super-commodity cycle and domestic politics playing out resulting in regime change. This resulted in higher prices for commodities like food and energy which pushed up inflation; disrupted trade and supply chains; and reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty.

In the backdrop inflation remained on its upward trajectory and clocked in at 12.7% in March 2022 mainly led by higher food and fuel prices, reflecting the impact of the global commodity price boom and Pak Rupee devaluation. For 9MFY22, average CPI clocked in at 10.8% YoY with major increase in food, transport, housing and electricity. Inflation is expected to remain elevated during the next few months, before starting to taper off in the latter half of this year.

Trade deficit rose from USD 16.0bn in 8MFY21 to USD 27.3bn in 8MFY22. Imports increased by 49% to USD 47.9bn in 8MFY22, reflecting TERF imports, commodity price surges and volumetric growth. On the positive side, exports grew 28% to USD 20.6bn during the same period. Remittances showed modest growth of 7.7% to USD 20.1bn, after the phenomenal increase of 27% in FY21.

Reflecting the surge in imports, the current account went into a deficit of USD 12.1bn in 8MFY22, compared to a surplus of USD 1.0bn in SPLY. Forex reserves fell to USD 17.5bn as of Apr 1, 2022 vs. USD 23.9bn at end Dec 2021 due to debt repayments, current account deficit, and Government payments, despite a USD 1bn disbursement from the IMF in February 2022. Similarly, Pak rupee depreciated by 3.8% against the US Dollar in 1Q 2022.

Fiscal deficit remained at 2.2% in Jul-Dec 2021, compared to 2.1% in SPLY, supported by strong tax collection and controlled expenditures. During Jul-Dec 2021, tax collection amounted to PKR 3.2tn, up 30% YoY (5.0% of GDP), while current expenditures increased by 16% to PKR 4.7tn as debt servicing costs remained stagnant and defence expenditures showed a small 7% increase.

Fiscal consolidation remains central to sustainable economic growth and for containing inflation and the current account during FY22. While the recently announced relief package for fuel and electricity made fiscal policy more expansionary, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and resultant commodity price surges posed challenges to the current account and inflation. Responding to the challenges, SBP increased policy rate by 250bps in early April to 12.25%.

Pakistan’s stock market was also affected by geopolitical tensions, external vulnerabilities and heightened political noise. During 1Q 2022, KSE100 index posted a meagre 0.75% return.

The new government’s economic team will have to deal with Asia’s second-fastest inflation and depleting foreign exchange reserves that have dropped to levels that can fund just a couple of months of imports. Pakistan’s economic growth is expected to grow by 4% in 2021-22 amid tighter fiscal and monetary policies and political uncertainty before picking up again in 2022-23.

Q1 2022 was another strong quarter for Bank Alfalah Limited whereby the Bank generated record revenue and profit. The Bank generated record revenue and net income, despite headwinds related to current account deficit and inflation. Each line of business grew net income for the quarter, and the bank continued to make significant investments in products, services and technology. Performance metrics posted strong growth as a testament to our strategy and customer centric approach.

The bank’s profit after taxation for the first quarter increased by 44.6% and stood at Rs. 5.019 billion as against Rs. 3.471 billion for the corresponding quarter last year. The Earning Per Share (EPS) is Rs. 2.82 (Mar 2020: Rs. 1.95).

The revenue increased by 31.9% as compared to same quarter last year; markup income grew significantly by 38.4%. The increase in markup income is driven by a combination of solid growth in net earning assets and re-pricing of the asset book. Non-markup income stood at Rs. 4.382 billion, higher by 14.3% from same period last year; growth was visible in all non-fund based income lines with exception of capital gains. Our Fee and commission income showed a growth of 32.9%. Combined debit and credit card spend was up by 64% and new card sales increased by 29%. We continue to outpace the industry in home remittance bringing our market share to around 18%. Trade and guarantee commission increased on back of significant volumetric growth. Auto loans remain strong, YoY outstanding up 36%, despite a lack of vehicle supply and SBP fiscal measures.

Home lending including Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar had another strong quarter with originations of Rs. 3.203 billion, outstanding volume almost double versus same period last year. We were able to meet construction finance target set by SBP for all quarters enabling us to avail incentive of lower cash reserve requirement (CRR). Higher disbursements of Government Ehsaas Funds and higher Banca business during the quarter further supported the growth in the fee income lines.

The Bank continues to keep a check on expenses and manage costs prudently while focusing on building revenue momentum through expansion and without compromising on investments in new ventures. Operating costs increased by 21.6% due to impact of new branches opened last year, investment in digital technologies and inflation related effects. Since 2020, we sharpened focus on products, services and technology to help reach out and serve our customers better. In last two years, we opened 98 new branches across Pakistan, which is helping us in deposit mobilization and revenue growth. We plan to continue to open branches in new markets in the months to follow.

The bank is investing heavily in digital technologies to influence customer preferences for digital channels, increase stickiness, and at the same time strengthen relationships. The bank saw a growth in digital banking usage and welcomed first-time users. Not only does this rise in digital transactions bode well for banks’ cost reduction plans, it is also contributing to topline growth. The bank’s cost to income ratio improved to 55.1% as against 59.7% for the corresponding quarter last year taking support from strong revenue growth.

The bank’s deposits closed at Rs. 1.178 trillion at the end of Q1’22, with YoY growth of 29.0% compared to Q1’21. We continue to outpace the industry in deposit growth as well as current account growth. The current and savings accounts grew by 31.0% and 35.6% respectively YoY. CASA mix improved to 80.6% versus 78.2% SPLY.

QUARTERLY REPORT - MARCH 31, 2022


BANK ALFALAH


The bank grew loans by 17.3% YoY, while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheet with significant capital and liquidity. The growth was achieved as a result of improvement in economic outlook and SBP’s refinance schemes. Overseas, Consumer, Retail and Islamic loan books grew by 107%, 50%, 21% and 31% respectively. As at the period end, our gross advances to deposits ratio stood at 60.4%, much higher than 50% on which higher income tax rate becomes applicable. The Bank’s non-performing loans ratio stood at 3.4%, while the non-performing loans remain fully covered through provisions which include provision held against subjectively classified loans and general provision against Covid restructured loans. As at March 31, 2022, the bank remains adequately capitalised with CAR at 14.77%.

# 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

# 2.1.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These unconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards comprise of:

- International Financial Reporting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as notified under Companies Act 2017;
- Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) as are notified under the Companies Act, 2017.
- Provisions of and directives issued under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017.
- Directives issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).

Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, Companies Act, 2017 or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IFRS or IFAS, requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017 and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002 till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(I)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015 has deferred applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the ICAP and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013 for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Further, SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. SBP has directed banks in Pakistan to implement IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2022. The Bank awaits final guidelines from SBP for application of some aspects of IFRS 9.

Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements; except for overseas branches where such standards are applicable.

# 22.3 Other contingent liabilities

# 22.3.1 Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts

7,046,425

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of collateral assets (such as hypothecated / mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), damage to reputation and cases filed by Ex. employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessment, management is confident that the matters will be decided in Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these financial statements.

# 22.4 Contingency for tax payable

# 22.4.1

There were no tax related contingencies other than as disclosed in note 33.1.

WORKERS WELFARE FUND

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 35.3 Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values:

# 35.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and Non government debt securities.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.

(c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 39.9 PLS Pool Management- Islamic Banking Group (IBG)

# 39.9.1 The pools, their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The profit and loss sharing between the Rabbul Maal (depositor) and Mudarib (Bank - IBG) is based upon the underlying principles of Mudaraba, where Bank also contributes its equity to general pool of funds, and becomes the capital provider.

Currently IBG is managing following pools:

1. General Pool for LCY Depositors
2. FCY Pool for Foreign Currency (USD, GBP, EURO, AED, SAR and CAD) depositors
3. FIs Pool for Treasury Purposes
4. IERS Pool for Islamic Export Refinance Scheme facilities
5. Special pool
6. PMRC Musharikah Pool

All the Mudaraba based Remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBG's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Advances, Investments, and Placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the Weightage system.

The IERS pool is maintained as per the guideline under SBP IERS Scheme. The assets, liabilities, equities, income and expenses are segregated for each of the pool. No pool investment is intermingled with each other. The risk associated with each pool is thus equally distributed among the pools.

AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS

Bank Alfalah maintains a two branch presence in Afghanistan. The board and management of the Bank continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in Afghanistan which has been hampered due to country frozen reserve and uncertainty regarding international recognition which prevent normal flows in and out of Afghanistan. The bank remains focused on maintaining its control standards i.e. both onshore and through Head Office oversight.

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of subsidiary from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Associates are those entities on which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Associates as well as investment in mutual funds established under trust structure are accounted for using the equity method. Non-controlling interests are that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary which are not owned by the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

# 2.2.2 Key financial figures of the Islamic Banking branches

are disclosed in note 39 to the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements.

|   | 7,046,425 | 4,823,035 |
| - | --------- | --------- |

These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of collateral assets (such as hypothecated / mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), damage to reputation and cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment. Based on legal advice and/or internal assessment, management is confident that the matters will be decided in Bank's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Bank is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these financial statements.

# 22.4 Contingency for tax payable

QUARTERLY REPORT - MARCH 31, 2022



23 BANK ALFALAH LIMITED


WORKERS WELFARE FUND

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated November 10, 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by Federal Government through Finance Act, 2008 for the levy of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) on banks were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order, which are currently pending. A legal advice was obtained by the Pakistan Banking Association which highlights that consequent to filing of these review petitions, a risk has arisen and the judgment is not conclusive until the review petition is decided. Accordingly, the amount charged for Workers Welfare Fund since 2008 has not been reversed.

72 BANK ALFALAH



24 BANK ALFALAH LIMITED

In respect of tax years 2008, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the tax authorities have raised certain issues including default in payment of WWF, allocation of expenses to dividend and capital gains, dividend income from mutual funds not being taken under income from business and disallowance of Leasehold improvements resulting in tax demand of Rs. 336.549 million net of relief provided in appeal (December 31, 2021: Rs. 714.263). Bank has filed appeals on these issues which are pending before Commissioner Appeals. The management is confident that these matters will be decided in favour of the Bank and consequently has not made any provision in respect of these amounts.

During the period bank received orders from a provincial tax authority for the periods from July 2014 to December 2020 wherein tax authority demanded sales tax on banking services and penalty amounting to Rs.275.051 million [excluding default surcharge] by disallowing certain exemptions of sales tax on banking services. Previously, the Bank has received provincial sales tax orders wherein tax authority demanded sales tax on banking services and penalty amounting to Rs.488.261 million [excluding default surcharge] by disallowing certain exemptions and allegedly for short payment of sales tax covering period from July 2011 to June 2014. Appeals against all these orders are pending before Commissioner Appeals. The Bank has not made any provision against these orders and the management is of the view that these matters will be settled in Bank's favour through appellate process.

The Bank has received an order from a tax authority wherein Sales tax and Further Tax amounting to Rs. 8.601 million [excluding default surcharge and penalty] is demanded allegedly for non-payment of sales tax on certain transactions relating to accounting year 2016. Bank appeal against this order is pending before Commissioner Appeals. The Bank has not made any provision against this order and the management is of the view that this matter will be favourably settled through appellate process.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date. The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 35.3.1 Fair value of financial assets

(a) Financial instruments in level 1

Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in ordinary shares of listed companies and Non government debt securities.

(b) Financial instruments in level 2

Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Market Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds, GoP Sukuks, GoP Euro Bonds, Overseas Government Sukuks, Overseas and Euro Bonds, Term Finance Certificates, and other than Government Sukuks, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.

(c) Financial instruments in level 3

Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.
