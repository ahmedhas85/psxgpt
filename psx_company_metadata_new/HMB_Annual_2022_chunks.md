# CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank, it gives me pleasure to present this report on overall performance of the Bank and effectiveness of the role played by the Board of Directors in achieving objectives of the Bank, together with the financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022. The operating financial results and appropriations on an unconsolidated basis, as recommended by the Board of Directors, are summarized below:

| Rupees in ‘000                                              |              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Profit before provisions and tax                            | 31,148,712   |

| Taxation                                                    | (13,356,536) |
| Profit after tax                                            | 14,260,723   |
| Un-appropriated profit brought forward                      | 30,198,569   |
| Transfer from surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax | 91,517       |
| Other comprehensive income                                  | 4,816        |
| Profit available for appropriation                          | 44,555,625   |
| Appropriations:                                             |              |
| Transfer to Statutory Reserve                               | (2,852,145)  |
| Cash dividend (Rs. 3.00 per share) - 2021                   | (3,143,494)  |
| Interim Cash dividend (Rs. 2.00 per share) - 2022           | (2,095,663)  |
|                                                             | (8,091,302)  |
| Un-appropriated profit carried forward                      | 36,464,323   |

The Directors are pleased to propose a final cash dividend of Rs. 3.25 per share (32.5%) for the year under review. This is in addition to the interim cash dividend of Rs. 2.00 per share (20%) already paid. As such, the total dividend for the year 2022 amounts to Rs. 5.25 per share (52.5%).

During the year under review, Pakistan faced macro-economic challenges which have increased manifold as the country goes forward towards the end of FY 2023.

By the Grace of Allah, your Bank continues to make steady progress. The total assets reached Rs. 1.4 trillion, gross advances increased to Rs. 455.4 billion at year-end with 8.6% growth. Bank's deposits increased to Rs. 880.7 billion as compared to Rs. 772.3 billion at the end of previous year.

HABIBMETRO delivered profit before tax of Rs. 27.62 billion for the year 2022. The performance translates into after tax earnings of Rs. 13.61 per share after absorbing the increase in effective tax rates on banking sector from 39% to 49%.

At year-end, HABIBMETRO’S equity stands at Rs. 74.51 billion, with a capital adequacy level of 14.61% against the required 11.50%.

The primary role of the Board is to set the overall strategy for the Bank and enhance its long-term strategic value. The Board's focus remains the overall governance structure to ensure effective oversight of the business, establishing a risk & control framework, determining Bank's level of risk tolerance through different policies and documents relating to operational, regulatory, compliance; and financial performance of the Bank.

# Board Composition and Performance Evaluation

The composition of the Board has been established to ensure the availability of a pool of resources with relevant knowledge and experience to manage the strategic objectives of the Bank. It comprises of three independent directors including one female director and five non-executive directors.

The Board ensures that the business of the Bank is conducted in an efficient and effective manner within an established framework of effective system of internal controls, robust risk management processes and compliance with regulatory requirements. In the course of discharging its responsibilities, the Board acts in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interests of the Bank and its Shareholders.

As per the SBP guidelines, an external board performance evaluation exercise was conducted in 2022 through Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG), which assesses Board's performance against best practices for board effectiveness. The assessment was designed to reflect Board's priorities, performance, comparison and consensus. It was based on different statements formatted on a 6-point likert scale prepared on strategy planning, board composition, control environment, risk oversight, chairperson, independent directors, board procedures, board committees, board & CEO compensation.

This review forms an integral part of the Directors' Report to the Shareholders.

I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and the Exchange Commission of Pakistan for their continued support and guidance. I also acknowledge our valued customers for their trust and staff members for their devotion and diligence.

We bow our heads to Allah and pray for His blessings and continued guidance.

On behalf of the Board

MOHAMEDALI R. HABIB

DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present the annual financial statements of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited (HABIBMETRO) for the financial year ended 31 December 2022.

## Chunk 5


# 1. ECONOMIC AND BANKING REVIEW

During the year under review, Pakistan faced continued deceleration in economic activities along with elevated inflationary pressures and current account deficit.

Inflation remained elevated throughout 2022, with some moderation witnessed in the last two months of the year, closing at 24.5 percent year-on-year, compared to 26.6 percent year-on-year in October in 2022. Food inflation emerged as the major driver of the accelerated inflationary pressures, which have since picked up in Q1 2023.

External sector continued to be beset with challenges. Despite a policy-induced contraction of 58 percent in current account deficit, which narrowed to USD 3.7 billion in H1 FY23 due to a considerable reduction of 18.2 percent in imports, lack of financial inflows and looming debt repayments further drained the dwindling official forex reserves. Meanwhile, a slowdown in exports and workers' remittances partly offset the gains from the import contraction. Moreover, the Pak rupee depreciated by 27.1 percent against US Dollar, during the year under review. FBR tax collections grew by 17 percent YoY in H1 FY22, slower than the growth envisaged in the Budget.

Pakistan has external debt repayment obligations of USD 73 billion in 3 years (FY23-25) as per IMF, compared to prevailing foreign exchange reserves of around USD 3 billion. In 7M FY23, Pakistan settled USD 15 billion of debt, of which USD 9 billion were repaid and USD 6 billion were rolled over. In the remaining months of FY23 (February - June 2023), Pakistan needs to repay USD 8 billion - of which USD 3 billion is likely to be rolled over while USD 2.2 billion of this amount pertains to bilateral/commercial loans which will be refinanced in due course. In this scenario, IMF's Extended Financing Facility (EFF) is critical for reducing uncertainty and unlocking multilateral and bilateral inflows.

Augmenting by 7.1 percent year-on-year, the Banking sector's deposit base managed decent growth and amounted to Rs. 22.47 trillion at the end December 2022; meanwhile, advances grew by 17.4 percent and stood at Rs. 11.91 trillion and investments increased by 26.8 percent to be recorded at Rs. 17.90 trillion.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased the policy rate by cumulative 625 basis points to 16 percent in 2022 (versus decrease of 275 basis points during 2021). Post year end, the SBP has in its Monetary Policy Statements, decided to increase the policy rate to 20 percent with a view to curtail the inflationary environment in the country.

# 2. BANK'S PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR

By the Grace of Allah, HABIBMETRO has posted a profit before tax of Rs. 27,617 million for year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 28.2 percent year-on-year. The earnings per share amounts to Rs. 13.61 after absorbing the increased effective tax rates (which increased from 39 percent to 49 percent for the banking sector).

The Bank's net interest income increased by 37.6 percent year-on-year and amounted to Rs. 40,611 million. Total non-interest income increased by 18.6 percent and amounted to Rs. 13,215 million. Fee and commission income increased by 14.8 percent and amounted to Rs. 7,931 million (compared to Rs. 6,906 million in 2021).

Investments and Net Advances increased by 8.3 percent and 8.8 percent during the year, and amounted to Rs. 723,579 million and Rs. 433,503 million, respectively. Deposits increased by 14.0 percent from their 2021 year-end level to Rs. 880,697 million. The Bank continues to focus on low-cost deposit mobilization - as a result of which, current deposits increased by 14.4 percent during the year to Rs. 306,840 million, with an increased CA mix of 34.8 percent.

The Bank's Net Equity exhibited a growth of 18.3 percent and amounted to Rs. 74,507 million, with a capital adequacy level of 14.6 percent at the end of the year under review.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

HABIBMETRO has a robust and rigorous risk management framework based on its complexity, size and target market. Risk Management aspects are embedded in HABIBMETRO’s philosophy, strategy, organizational practices and structure. The Bank has devised a cohesive risk management structure for credit, operations, information, continuity, liquidity and market risk, with an integrated approach and strengthened internal controls.

The framework ensures comprehensive management of risk across all areas of the Bank. It has a role at all levels and tiers of the Bank with risk management considerations embedded at the strategic, tactical as well as the operational levels. It is equipped with the capacity and flexibility to respond to evolving market, regulatory as well and internal risk requirements.

The Bank's entire branch network is on-line, and its state-of-the-art processing system is secure and has adequate capacity. Segregation of duties as a control is built into the Bank's system and organization. The Internal Audit Division conducts independent, risk-based review and verification of the Bank's branches and major functions throughout the year for evaluation of the control system. Comprehensive internal reports and an effective Management Information System has been developed as an additional tool for the management of risk control. The Risk Management Division is staffed with seasoned and experienced professionals, who have the capacity and knowledge to cover all aspects of risks faced by the Bank.

## Chunk 20


# CREDIT RISK

HABIBMETRO observes a strategy to control credit risk through product, geography, industry and customer diversification. The Bank extends trade and working capital financing, keeping the major portion of its exposure on a short-term and self-liquidating basis. A major portion of the Bank's credit portfolio is priced on a floating rate basis using KIBOR as a reference, which minimizes interest rate risk. The risk inherent in extending credit is further mitigated by rigorous and robust credit approval procedures, which have been structured to ensure proper evaluation, adequacy of security, and monitoring of exposures on an ongoing basis. All these risk-mitigation measures are further facilitated by centralized trade processing and credit administration.

HABIBMETRO is in the process of implementing the IFRS-9 standards. IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidelines of the IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and includes revised standards on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and de-recognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. The Bank is aligning its implementation with the SBP timelines issued from time to time.

Internal Audit periodically reviews the Bank's policies, processes, systems, and controls to provide reasonable assurance to the governing authorities and adds value towards the Bank's risk mitigation endeavors.

The Bank's performance management mechanism provides a sound basis for assessing employee performance holistically. The Bank's remuneration policy is aligned with the performance management mechanism and differentiates pay appropriately amongst its employees based on degree of contribution, skill and availability of talent owing to competitive market forces by considering factors such as role, skills, competencies, experience and grade / seniority.

Performance measurement of MRTs / MRCs is carried-out through the risk-adjusted balanced scorecards. The Bank has developed risk-adjusted balanced scorecards for all MRTs and MRCs for their performance measurement, which ensure establishing a correlation between and alignment of risks and rewards. These scorecards are prepared at individual levels, incorporating various financial, non-financial / qualitative and risk-adjusting factors.

The Bank has introduced an individual level accountability mechanism whereby a certain portion of variable compensation of the MRTs / MRCs is deferred / withheld for a defined period, thus creating alignment between the employees' and stakeholders' interests and reinforcing that compensation is appropriately linked to longer-term sustainable performance.

The deferred pay is subject to claw back clause that permits the Bank to cancel or reduce, all or part of the amount of an unvested variable compensation award, due to malus triggers i.e. specific crystallized risk, behavior, conduct, or adverse performance outcome, attributable to the MRT / MRC.

# To the members of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited

# Review Report on Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019

We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019 (“the Regulations”) prepared by the Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited (“the Bank”) for the year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No. 36 of the Regulations.

The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Our responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Bank's compliance with the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and review of various documents prepared by the Bank to comply with the Regulations.

As part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to consider whether the Board of Directors' statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Bank's corporate governance procedures and risks.

The Regulations require the Bank to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions. We are only required and have ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance does not appropriately reflect the Bank's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in the Regulations as applicable to the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022.

# MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

An internal control system is a set of procedures and activities designed to identify, evaluate and mitigate the risk in processes and operations in order to support the overall business objectives of the Bank. It is the responsibility of the Bank's management to establish an internal control system to maintain an adequate and effective internal control environment on an ongoing basis.

The management of the Bank has formulated, implemented, and maintained a system of internal controls approved by the Board of Directors, the goal of which is to achieve effectiveness and efficiency of operations while adhering to laws and regulations, resulting in reliability of financial reporting. However, any system of internal controls can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve objectives. It can therefore only provide reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance against material misstatement and loss. It also requires continuous improvement to align it with the changing environment and needs of the business.

The Bank monitors its processes and operations on an ongoing basis to ensure that an effective and efficient internal control system remains active and implemented and strive for continuous strengthening of its control environment. The internal control structure comprises of different levels of monitoring activities.

Line Management's role is to monitor day-to-day operations and ensure that the business risks are properly mitigated, control breaches are identified on a timely basis and corrective actions are promptly implemented.

The Compliance Division of the Bank is entrusted with the responsibility to minimize compliance risk and strengthen compliance environment across the organization and ensure a professional working relationship with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory bodies. The Management has established a Management Compliance Committee to oversee compliance and controls related matters of the bank. Compliance status of irregularities identified and other compliance related matters are reported to the Bank's Management Compliance Committee, while significant compliance matters are also reported to Board Risk & Compliance Committee. Further, compliance status of observations highlighted in regulatory inspection reports are also presented in Board Risk & Compliance Committee. The Division also has a Financial Crimes and Compliance function to ensure compliance with the relevant AML / CFT / CPF Laws & Regulations.

Internal Audit Division is an independent function and follows a risk-based approach to provide reasonable assurance to the governing authorities on adequacy and effectiveness of the Bank's procedures, processes, controls and systems. All significant / material observations made through internal audit activities are reported to the Board Audit Committee (BAC) on a regular basis, which actively monitors and tracks resolution of these observations and provides guidance in improving the overall control environment of the Bank.

Based upon the results achieved from reviews, ongoing testing of financial reporting controls and audits conducted during the year 20212, management considers that, the existing system of internal controls is adequate and has been effectively implemented and monitored.

Based on the above, we are of the view that:

1. The Bank has complied with Shariah rules and principles in the light of fatawa, rulings and guidelines issued by its Shariah Board.
2. The Bank has by and large complied with directives, regulations, instructions and guidelines related to Shariah compliance issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in accordance with the rulings of SBP's Shariah Advisory Committee.
3. The Bank has a comprehensive mechanism in place to ensure Shariah compliance in their overall operations.
4. The Bank has a well-defined system in place sound enough to ensure that any earnings realized from sources or by means prohibited by Shariah have been credited to charity account and are being properly utilized for charitable purposes.
5. The Bank has complied with the SBP instructions on profit & loss distribution and pool management.
6. The Learning Department and the management have arranged various Islamic Banking capacity building sessions and are in continuous process to enhance Islamic Banking learning network. In this regard, the level of awareness, capacity and sensitization of the staff, management and the Board in appreciating the importance of Shariah compliance in the products and processes of the Bank, is acceptable.
7. The Shariah Board has been provided adequate resources enabling it to discharge its duties. However, considering the increase in the business, network and volume of the work, it is suggested to further strengthen the Shariah compliance function in the Bank.

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the unconsolidated financial statements, consolidated financial statements and our auditors' reports thereon.

Our opinion on the unconsolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the unconsolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the unconsolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of unconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the unconsolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these unconsolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

# Report on the Audit of the Unconsolidated Financial Statements

l   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.

l   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

l   Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.

l   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the unconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

Based on our audit, we further report that in our opinion:

1. proper books of account have been kept by the Bank as required by the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and the returns referred above from the branches have been found adequate for the purpose of our audit;
2. the unconsolidated statement of financial position, the unconsolidated statement of profit or loss, the unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, the unconsolidated statement of changes in equity and the unconsolidated statement of cash flows together with the notes thereon have been drawn up in conformity with the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and are in agreement with the books of account and returns;
3. investments made, expenditure incurred and guarantees extended during the year were in accordance with the objects and powers of the Bank and the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank;
4. zakat deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of 1980), was deducted by the Bank and deposited in the Central Zakat Fund established under Section 7 of that Ordinance.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Amyn Pirani.

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity’s business model. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank has reviewed the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

## Chunk 88


# Equity securities

Equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Bank will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. The amount of AFS reserves, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified to retained earnings. However, there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. However, the SBP has allowed banks to carry these investments under the current Prudential Regulations, ie at the lower of cost and break-up value, till accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

## Chunk 89


# Debt securities and loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those that pass the SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investments. Debt securities currently classified as Held-to-maturity securities and those which pass the SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the Bank's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Cashflows of certain debt instruments classified in AFS categories, that do not pass the SPPI test would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FV OCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. On initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.



The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Bank has used 7 years data till 31 December 2022 and going forward, yearly data shall be included until the Bank has at least 10 years’ data. For calculating ECL, the Bank shall classify its financial assets under three following categories:

1. Stage 1: Performing assets: Financial assets where there has not been a SICR since initial recognition, the Bank shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
2. Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but they are not credit impaired, the Bank shall recognize an allowance for the lifetime ECL for all exposures categorized in this stage based on the actual maturity profile.
3. Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: Financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. The Bank shall recognize ECL on these financial assets using the higher of approach, which means that lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 is compared with regulatory provision required as per Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

As required by the application instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply.

# Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Bank shall calculate 12 month ECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., Stage 1 or a lifetime expected loss for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., Stage 2.

# Current Page

At every reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset. If there is a SICR, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (Stage 2 or 3).

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

# Impact of adoption of IFRS 9

The Bank will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective 01 January 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Bank’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Bank would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Bank has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022.

# Classification, measurement and financial impact

Based on the bank’s assessment, IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have the following impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets and financial liabilities:

- Debt instruments amounting to Rs. 2,097,835 thousand and Rs. 4,681,209 thousand will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL and amortised cost respectively. However, there would be no impact on overall equity.
- Equity instruments amounting to Rs. 1,690,074 thousand will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL.

Total estimated adjustment (net of tax) due to the adoption of IFRS 9 for Expected Credit Loss on the opening balance of the Bank's equity at 1 January 2023 is expected to be Rs. 1,217 million approximately.

The Bank continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption, although parallel runs have been carried out till the third quarter of 2022, the new systems and associated controls in place have not been operational for a more extended period.

# Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets on Capital, the SBP has permitted the Banks to adopt a transitional provision to phase in the impact over a period of five years.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

The preparation of these unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with approved accounting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 2.6 Changes in accounting policies

# 2.6.1 Change in accounting policy of land and building from cost to revaluation model

With effect from 30 June 2022, the Bank has voluntarily changed its accounting policy for land and buildings (freehold and leasehold) from the cost model to the revaluation model, as permitted under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. On adoption, these are carried at a revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any), which previously were carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). The impact of the change in accounting policy has been disclosed in note 11.3. The management believes that the new accounting policy will result in the financial statements providing more relevant information and more realistic reflection of the values of these assets. The change has been dealt in accordance with the requirements of IAS 16, and accordingly, the Bank has applied the accounting policy prospectively.

# 4.4.3 Initial measurement

Investments (other than held-for-trading) include transaction costs associated with the investments. In case of held-for-trading transaction costs are charged to profit and loss account when incurred. All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Bank commits the purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of investments that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

# Subsequent measurement

# Held-for-trading

Investments classified as held-for-trading are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on the revaluation of the Bank’s held-for-trading investment portfolio is taken to the profit and loss account.

# Held-to-maturity

Investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortised cost.

Quoted securities classified as available-for-sale are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on revaluation of quoted securities classified as available for sale is kept in a separate account shown in equity. Surplus / deficit arising on these securities is taken to the profit and loss account when actually realised upon disposal or when the investment is considered to be impaired. Unquoted equity securities are valued at the lower of cost and break-up value. Break-up value of these securities is calculated as per the latest available audited financial statements. Investments in other unquoted securities are valued at cost less impairment losses, if any.

# 4.6.2 Property and equipment (Owned)

Fixed assets are stated at cost, except for land and buildings which are carried at revalued amount, less any applicable accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). Land and buildings are stated at revalued amount less accumulated depreciation (in case of buildings) and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset at the rates specified in note 11.2. Depreciation on additions during the year is calculated from the date of addition. In case of disposals during the year, the depreciation is charged till the date of disposal.



Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account.

An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and changes, if any, are treated as change in accounting estimates, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and building account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognized in the profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognized in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of land and building account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation on the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset. Surplus on revaluation of land and building (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit. Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realized on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at amount equal to present value of lease liability, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of end of the useful life of right-of-use asset or end of the lease term.

# 4.7 Intangible assets

These are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. The cost of intangible assets are amortised from the month when the assets are available for intended use, using the straight line method, whereby the cost of the intangible asset is amortised over its estimated useful life over which economic benefits are expected to flow to the Bank. The useful life and amortisation method is reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

# 4.8 Non-banking assets

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recorded at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified valuators with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value. A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to property is charged to the profit and loss account.

Depreciation on assets (other than land) acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on the Bank's owned fixed assets. If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately. These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realised on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realised on the sale of fixed assets. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit. If such an asset is subsequently used by the Bank for its own operations, the asset is transferred to fixed assets along with any related surplus.

# 4.10 Provisions

Provision against identified off-balance exposure is recognised when intimated and reasonable certainty exists for the Bank to settle the obligation.

Other provisions are recognised when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

# 4.21 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax asset)

At each statement of financial position date, the Bank reviews the carrying amount of its assets (other than deferred tax asset) to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of relevant asset is estimated. Recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the assets is reduced to its recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.

# 10.4.4 Consideration of forced sales value (FSV) for the purposes of provisioning against non-performing loans

In accordance with BSD Circular No. 1 of 21 October 2011 issued by the SBP, the bank has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of certain collaterals against non-performing loans. Had this benefit of FSV not been taken by the bank, specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 2,617,170 thousand (2021: Rs. 208,257 thousand) and profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 1,334,757 thousand (2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand). This amount of Rs. 1,334,757 thousand (2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand) is not available for distribution of cash and stock dividend to the shareholders and bonus to employees.

# 18.3 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the Bank is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The Bank has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years. The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending. Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly, the Bank maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

# 35.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes include:

- Asset volatility: The risk of the investment underperforming and being not sufficient to meet the liabilities. The duration of the liabilities is 10 Years. Based on the weighted average duration of this plan and guidance from Pakistan Society of Actuaries (“PSOA”), the discount rate used for the calculations is 14.25% per annum.
- Inflation risk: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is greater than what we assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.
- Mortality rate: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.
- Withdrawal rate: The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.

# 38. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment in subsidiaries and those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

# 38.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 43. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management aspects are embedded in the Bank’s strategy, organization structure and processes. The Bank has adopted a cohesive risk management structure for credit, market, liquidity and operational risk with an integrated approach to strengthen the process and system as controls are more effective and valuable when built into the process. Effective risk management is considered essential in the preservation of the assets and long-term profitability of the Bank. Clear guidelines and limits, which are under regular review, are backed by a system of internal controls and independent audit inspections. Internal reporting / MIS are additional tools for measuring and controlling risks. Separation of duties is also embedded in the Bank’s system and organization.

# 43.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a transaction may default. It arises principally in relation to the lending and trade finance business carried out by the Bank.

As per Basel II methodology the gross credit risk weighted exposure incorporating relevant credit conversion factor is Rs. 441,448,612 thousand (2021: Rs. 396,800,985 thousand) as depicted in note 42.

The Bank’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through a strong pre-disbursement credit analysis, approval and risk measurement process added with product, geography and customer diversification. The Bank, as its strategic preference, extends trade and working capital financing, so as to keep the major portion of exposure (funded and non-funded) on a short-term, self-liquidating basis. Major portion of the Bank's credit portfolio is priced on flexible basis with pricing reviewed on periodic basis.

With the expansion of the Consumer lending portfolio, the Credit Review & Administration efforts have been accordingly enhanced by inducting specialized consumer credit risk analysts and processing specialists.

Centralized Credit and Trade processing centre staffed with experienced resource provide strength to post-disbursement aspect of credit risk management.

The Bank’s credit policy / manual defines the credit extension criteria, the credit approval and monitoring process, the loan classification system and provisioning policy.

The Bank continually assesses and monitors credit exposures. The Bank follows both objective and subjective criteria of SBP regarding loans classification. The subjective assessment process is based on management's judgement with respect to the borrower's character, activity, cash flow, capital structure, security, quality of management and delinquency.

The Bank uses the 'Standardised Approach' in calculation of credit risk and capital requirements.

# Credit Risk Management

The Bank uses reputable and SBP approved rating agencies for deriving risk weight to specific credit exposures. These are applied consistently across the Bank credit portfolio for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. The methodology applied for using External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI's) inclusive of the alignment of alpha numeric scale of each agency used with risk bucket is as per SBP guidelines as is given below:

The forms of collateral that are deemed eligible under the ‘Simple Approach’ to credit risk mitigation as per SBP guidelines are used by the Bank and primarily includes cash, government, equity investment in blue chip companies and rated debt securities.

The Bank applies SBP specified haircut to collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral management is embedded in the Bank’s risk taking and risk management policy and procedures. A standard credit granting procedure exists which has been well-disseminated down the line, ensuring proper pre-sanction evaluation, adequacy of security, pre-examination of charge/control documents and monitoring of each exposure on an ongoing basis.

Collateral information is recorded diligently in the Bank's main processing systems by type of collateral, amount of collateral against relevant credit exposures. A cohesive accounting/risk management system facilitates effective collateral management for Basel II reporting.

# 43.2 Market risk

Market Risk is the risk of loss in earnings and capital due to adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices as well as their correlations and volatilities. Market Risk performs risk measurement, monitoring, and control functions through the use of various risk procedures and tools.

The Bank has a comprehensive Board approved market risk management policy wherein the governance structure for managing market risk, methods to control market risk, measurement tools used, the market risk exposure limits and the tolerance levels have been addressed. The Bank’s strategy for managing market risk is to relate the level of risk exposures to their risk appetite and the capital base. This structure is reviewed, adjusted and approved periodically.

The Board of Directors oversees the Bank's strategy for market risk exposures. The Bank’s Market Risk Management governance structure consists of the Risk & Compliance Committee (BR&CC) of the Board, Investment Committee and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) and is assisted by the independent Market Risk function with reporting line to the Risk Management Division.

The asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) which comprises senior management oversees the financial position of the Bank, assesses the impact of the interest rate change on the Bank's investment portfolio through sensitivity analysis, duration and performs an oversight function to ensure sound asset quality, liquidity and pricing considering the current interest rate environment. The investment policy amongst other aspects covers the Bank asset allocation guidelines.

# 43.2.2 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is the probability of loss resulting from adverse movement in exchange rates. The Bank’s business model for foreign exchange risk is to serve trading activities of its clients in an efficient and cost effective manner. The Bank is not in the business of actively trading and market making activities and all FX exposures are backed by customers' trade transaction. A conservative risk approach backed by Bank’s business strategy to work with export oriented clients gives the ability to meet its foreign exchange needs.

# 43.2.4 Yield / interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB)-Basel II specific

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the market interest rates. Interest rate risk is also controlled through flexible credit pricing mechanism and variable deposit rates. Duration analysis and stress testing are being carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates on bank's fixed income portfolio. Optimization of yield is achieved through the Bank’s investment strategy which aims on attaining a balance between yield and liquidity under the strategic guidance of the ALCO. The advances and deposits of the Bank are repriced on a periodic basis based on interest rates scenario.

# Funding Strategy

Habib Metro’s strong deposit base backed by continued customer confidence and holding of government securities has enabled the bank to maintain a robust liquidity profile, also depicted through a strong LCR ratio.

The Bank’s liquidity model is based on “self-reliance” with an extensive branch network to diversify the Bank deposit base. Further, the Bank can also generate liquidity from Interbank market against government securities to fund its short term requirement, if any. The Bank as a policy invests significantly in highly liquid government securities that can be readily converted into cash to meet unforeseen liquidity requirements, besides yielding attractive returns.

# 12. Pool management</h9>
Pools maintained by the Bank's Islamic Banking Division (IBD), their key features and risk and reward characteristics.

The Bank operates general and special pools for deposits and inter-bank funds accepted/acquired under Mudaraba and Musharakah modes. Under the general deposits pools, the Bank accepts funds on Mudaraba basis from depositors (Rabb-ul-Maal) where the Bank acts as Manager (Mudarib) and invests the funds in Shariah Compliant modes of financing, investments and placements. IERS and other pools (special pools) are operated for funds acquired/accepted from the State Bank of Pakistan and other banks for Islamic Export Refinance to the Bank's customers and liquidity management respectively under the Musharakah/Mudaraba modes. Further, the Bank also contributes its equity and becomes the capital provider, wherein required.

Following pools are being managed by IBD:

- General pool for local and foreign currencies for depositors
- Islamic export refinance scheme musharaka pool
- Special pool

All the Mudaraba based remunerative deposits shall be considered as an investment from Rabbul Maal in the pool, along with IBD's own share of equity, which is also commingled in the pool. The applications of these funds are on Islamic financing and related assets, Investments, and Placements for generating profits to be shared among the depositors as per the Weightage system.

The IERS Pool caters the 'Islamic Export Refinance' requirements based on the guidelines issued by the SBP. Profits are calculated on the basis of weightages assigned to different tiers and tenors. These weightages are announced at the beginning of the period, while considering weightages emphasis shall be given to the quantum, type and the period of risk assessed by applying following factors:

- Contracted period, nature and type of deposit/fund.
- Payment cycle of profit on such deposit/fund, i.e. monthly, quarterly or on maturity.
- Magnitude of risk.

Any change in profit sharing weightages of any category of deposit/fund providers shall be applicable from the next month (where applicable).

We issued instructions to the auditors of two scoped in components, highlighting 'Provision against advances' as a significant risk. The auditors of those components performed audit procedures to respond to the significant risk and reported the results thereof to us. We, as auditors of the Group, also evaluated the work performed by the component auditors through their files review and discussions with them. |

# Information Other than the Consolidated and Unconsolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the unconsolidated financial statements, consolidated financial statements and our auditors' reports thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan, the requirements of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will...



always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide to the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Amyn Pirani.

# 1.2.3 First Habib Modaraba (15.43% holding (2021 : 10%)) and earlier Habib Metro Modaraba (2021 : 70% holding)

First Habib Modaraba (FHM) is a perpetual, multi-purpose modaraba having its registered office at 6th Floor, HBZ Plaza, I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi. It is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange and engaged in the business of leasing (Ijarah), Musharaka, Murabaha financing and other related business.

Habib Metro Modaraba (HMM) was a perpetual, multi-purpose modaraba having its registered office at 3rd Floor Al-Manzoor Building, I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi. HMM’s primary business activities was residual value car financing and provision of finance for solar power solutions on the basis of Ijarah / rental / musharkah or any other approved modes of financing. The holding company and the Modaraba Management Company earlier owned 60% and 10% of the certificates of HMM respectively.

The Board of Directors of Habib Metropolitan Modaraba Management Company (Private) Limited approved and entered into Scheme of Arrangement dated 22 July 2022 for the merger, by way of amalgamation, of Habib Metro Modaraba with and into First Habib Modaraba (FHM) under Sections 279 to 282 Companies Act, 2017. As a consequence of that, the entire undertaking of the HMM shall stand transferred to and vested in FHM which shall continue to be managed by the Management Company of FHM while HMM shall be dissolved and will cease to exist without.




Winding up. All regulatory approvals including the approval of the majority of the certificate holders have been obtained. Petition for the said merger was filed in the Honourable High Court of Sindh in August 2022. Subsequent to the year end, Honourable High Court of Sindh sanctioned the scheme of arrangement for merger by way of amalgamation with effect from 01 July 2022, whereby the entire undertaking and business inclusive of all assets, properties, rights, liabilities and dues of HMM will be transferred to and assumed by FHM. FHM will continue as a going concern and HMM upon amalgamation will cease to exist. These financial statements include the effect of the above merger in accordance with the aforesaid order of the High Court of Sindh.

On the scheme becoming effective, issued, subscribed and paid-up certificate capital of HMM of Rs. 300,000 thousand shall be merged with and combined with the issued, subscribed and paid-up certificate capital of FHM. Consequently the issued, subscribed and paid-up certificate capital of FHM shall stand increased to Rs.1,108,305 thousand divided into 221,661 thousand modaraba certificates of Rs. 5 each at a swap ratio of 0.6687 : 1:00 (FHM : HMM).

Since HMM was a group entity under common control, the merger has been accounted for as a common control transaction and predecessor accounting approach has been applied (under the Accounting Standard for 'Accounting of Common Control Transaction' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan). Under predecessor accounting, the acquired net assets of HMM have been included in the financial statements of FHM at the same carrying values as recorded in HMM's own financial statements as on 30 June 2022. The consolidated results and the statement of financial position are presented prospectively from date of merger.

However, the entire arrangement have had no significant impact on the Group's financial statements/results (as earlier also financial statements of both the Modarabas were being consolidated). Impact of adjustment in merger reserve and in non-controlling interest amounted to Rs. 31,002 thousand.

# Classification and measurement

The classification and measurement of financial assets depends on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity’s business model. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at FVTPL regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank has reviewed the impact of the initial adoption of IFRS 9 on its financial assets as follows:

# Equity securities

Equity shares currently held as available-for-sale (AFS) with gains and losses recorded in OCI, the Group will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI, and, therefore, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on adoption. However, in accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities. The amount of AFS reserves, which is currently presented as accumulated OCI, will be reclassified to retained earnings. However there will be no impact on overall equity with respect to such classification.

Unquoted equity securities are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9. However, the SBP has allowed banks to carry these investments under the current Prudential Regulations, i.e. at the lower of cost and break-up value, till accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

# Debt securities and loans and advances

Debt securities currently classified as AFS and those that pass SPPI test, are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investments. Debt securities currently classified as Held-to-maturity securities and those which pass SPPI test are expected to be measured at amortized costs under IFRS 9 as the Group's business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows.

Cashflows of certain debt instruments classified in AFS categories, that do not pass the SPPI test would be measured at fair value through profit and loss.

# Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. On initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.

The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.

Based on the requirement of IFRS 9 and SBP’s IFRS 9 application instructions, the Group has performed an ECL assessment taking into account the key elements such as assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These elements are described below:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.
- LGD: It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including any form of collateral.
- EAD: the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

For the purpose of calculation of ECL, the Group has used 5 to 7 years data till 31 December 2022 and going forward, yearly data shall be included until the holding company has at least 10 years’ data. For calculating ECL, the Group shall classify its financial assets under three following categories:

1. Stage 1: Performing assets: Financial assets where there has not been a SICR since initial recognition, the Group shall recognize an allowance based on the 12-month ECL.
2. Stage 2: Under-Performing Assets: Financial assets where there has been a SICR since initial recognition, but they are not credit impaired, the Group shall recognize an allowance for the lifetime ECL for all exposures categorized in this stage based on the actual maturity profile.
3. Stage 3: Non-Performing Assets: Financial assets which have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. The Group shall recognize ECL on these financial assets using the higher of approach, which means that lifetime ECL computed under IFRS 9 is compared with regulatory provision required as per Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

As required by the application instructions, financial assets may be reclassified out of stage 3 if they meet the requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by SBP. Financial assets in stage 2 may be reclassified to stage 1 if the conditions that led to a SICR no longer apply.

# Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the

## Chunk 357


# Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and/or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Group shall calculate 12 month ECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., Stage 1 or a lifetime expected loss for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., Stage 2. At every reporting date, the Group shall assess whether there has been a SICR since the initial recognition of the asset. If there is a SICR, the asset must be assigned to the appropriate stage of credit impairment (Stage 2 or 3).

Under the SBP’s instructions, credit exposure (in local currency) guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL Framework. Moreover, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions would be made as per IFRS 9 ECL and Stage 3 provision would be made considering higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under existing requirements of Prudential Regulations issued by the SBP.

# Impact of Adoption of IFRS 9

The Group will adopt IFRS 9 in its entirety effective 01 January 2023 with modified retrospective approach for restatement. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial statements in the year 2023 may not be accurately estimated because it will be dependent on the financial instruments that the Group would hold during next year and economic conditions at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements that it will make in future. Nevertheless, the Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of IFRS 9 based on its statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022.

# Classification, Measurement and Financial Impact

Based on the Group’s assessment, IFRS 9 requirements are expected to have the following impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets and financial liabilities:

- Debt instruments amounting to Rs. 2,177,835 thousand and Rs. 4,681,209 thousand will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL and amortised cost respectively. However, there would be no effect on overall equity.
- Equity instruments amounting to Rs. 1,790,656 thousand will be reclassified from AFS to FVTPL.

Total estimated adjustment (net of tax) due to the adoption of IFRS 9 for Expected Credit Loss on the opening balance of the Group's equity at 1 January 2023 is expected to be Rs. 1,220 million approximately. The Group continues to refine its expected credit loss model and embed its operational processes which may change the actual impact on adoption, although parallel runs have been carried out till the third quarter of 2022 by the holding company, the new systems and associated controls in place have not been operational for a more extended period.

# Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets on Capital, the SBP has permitted the Banks to adopt a transitional provision to phase in the impact over a period of five years.

# 2.5 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with approved accounting standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant accounting estimates and areas where judgements were made by management in the application of accounting policies are as follows:

- i) Classification, valuations and impairment of investments (note 4.5)
- ii) Provision against non-performing loans and advances (note 4.6.1)

# 2.6 Changes in accounting policies

# 2.6.1 Change in accounting policy of land and building from cost to revaluation model

With effect from 30 June 2022, the Group has voluntarily changed its accounting policy for land and buildings (freehold and leasehold) from the cost model to the revaluation model, as permitted under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ (IAS 16). On adoption, these are carried at a revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any), which previously were carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). The impact of the change in accounting policy has been disclosed in note 11.3.

The management believes that the new accounting policy will result in the financial statements providing more relevant information and more realistic reflection of the values of these assets. The change has been dealt in accordance with the requirements of IAS 16, and accordingly, the Group has applied the accounting policy prospectively.

# 4.2 Basis of consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the holding company and its subsidiaries. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the control commences until the date the control ceases. In preparing consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of the holding company and subsidiaries are consolidated on a line by line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Non-controlling interest is that portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate item in the consolidated financial statements.

# 4.5.2 Initial measurement

Investments (other than held-for-trading) include transaction costs associated with the investments. In case of held-for-trading transaction costs are charged to profit and loss account when incurred.

All “regular way” purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits the purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of investments that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

# Subsequent measurement

# Held-for-trading

Investments classified as held-for-trading are subsequently measured at fair value. Any unrealised surplus / deficit arising on the revaluation of the Group’s held-for-trading investment portfolio is taken to the profit and loss account.

# Held-to-maturity

# Salam

In Salam, the seller undertakes to supply specific goods to the buyer at a future date in exchange of an advanced price fully paid at spot. The payment is at spot but the supply of purchased goods is deferred. The purchased goods by the holding company are then sold by the customer on behalf of the holding company and the financed amount along with profit is paid to the holding company.



Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset at the rates specified in note 11.2. Depreciation on additions during the year is calculated from the date of addition. In case of disposals during the year, the depreciation is charged till the date of disposal.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account.

An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and changes, if any, are treated as change in accounting estimates, at each statement of financial position date.

Land and buildings are revalued by independent professionally qualified valuers with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying amount does not differ materially from their fair value. If an asset’s carrying value increases as a result of revaluation, such increase or surplus arising on revaluation is credited to the surplus on revaluation of land and building account. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the increase reverses a deficit on the same asset previously recognized in the profit and loss account, such an increase is also recognized in the profit and loss account to the extent of the previous deficit and thereafter in the surplus on the revaluation of land and building account.

In the case of revalued assets, any accumulated depreciation on the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the net asset and the net amount restated at the revalued amount of the asset.

Surplus on revaluation of land and building (net of any associated deferred tax) to the extent of the incremental depreciation charged on the related assets is transferred to unappropriated profit. Surplus on revaluation (net of any deferred tax) realized on disposal of land and building is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

# 4.9 Non-banking assets

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. These assets are revalued by professionally qualified


valuators with sufficient regularity to ensure that their net carrying value does not differ materially from their fair value.

A surplus arising on revaluation of property is credited to the 'surplus on revaluation of non-banking assets' account and any deficit arising on revaluation is taken to profit and loss account directly. Legal fees, transfer costs and direct costs of acquiring title to property is charged to the profit and loss account.

Depreciation on assets (other than land) acquired in satisfaction of claims is charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis as depreciation charged on the holding company's owned fixed assets.

If the recognition of such assets results in a reduction in non-performing loans, such reductions and the corresponding reductions in provisions held against non-performing loans are disclosed separately.

If such an asset is subsequently used by the holding company for its own operations, the asset is transferred to fixed assets. These assets are generally intended for sale. Gains and losses realised on the sale of such assets are disclosed separately from gains and losses realised on the sale of fixed assets. Surplus on revaluation (net of deferred tax) realised on disposal of these assets is transferred directly to unappropriated profit.

If such an asset is subsequently used by the holding company for its own operations, the asset is transferred to fixed assets along with any related surplus.

# 4.22 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding deferred tax asset)

At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its assets (other than deferred tax asset) to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of relevant asset is estimated. Recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the assets is reduced to its recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Details of the basis of determination of impairment against loans and advances and investments have been discussed in their respective notes.

# 10.5.4 Consideration of forced sales value (FSV) for the purposes of provisioning against non-performing loans

In accordance with BSD Circular No. 1 of 21 October 2011 issued by the SBP, the holding company has availed the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of certain collaterals against non-performing loans and advances. Had this benefit of FSV not been taken by the holding company, the specific provision against non-performing advances would have been higher by Rs. 2,617,170 thousand (2021: Rs. 208,257 thousand) and profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 1,334,757 thousand (2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand). This amount of Rs. 1,334,757 thousand (31 December 2021: Rs. 127,036 thousand) is not available for distribution of cash and stock dividend to the shareholders and bonus to employees.

# 18.3 Workers' Welfare Fund

Under the Workers' Welfare Ordinance 1971, the holding company is liable to pay workers' welfare fund (WWF) @ 2% of accounting profit before tax or taxable income, whichever is higher. The holding company has made full provision for WWF based on profit for the respective years.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan vide its order dated 10 November 2016 has held that the amendments made in the law introduced by the Federal Government for the levy of WWF were not lawful. The Federal Board of Revenue has filed review petitions against this order which are currently pending.



Legal advice obtained on the matter indicates that consequent to filing of these review petitions, the judgement may not currently be treated as conclusive. Accordingly the holding company maintains its provision in respect of WWF.

18.4 This includes Rs. 12,186,315 thousand (2021: Nil) received by the holding company from a correspondent bank against standby letter of credit claimed by the customer. The honorable High Court of Sindh has passed interim order restraining the holding company to transfer amount pending arbitration.

# 35.10 Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis has been performed by varying one assumption keeping all other assumptions constant and calculating the impact on the present value of the defined benefit obligations under the various employee benefit schemes. The increase / (decrease) in the present value of defined benefit obligations as a result of change in each assumption is summarized below:

|                                                    | 2022      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1 % increase in discount rate                      | (187,099) |
| 1 % decrease in discount rate                      | 216,806   |
| 1% increase in expected future increment in salary | 217,935   |
| 1% decrease in expected future increment in salary | (191,281) |
| 10% increase in expected withdrawal rate           | 750       |
| 10% decrease in expected withdrawal rate           | (783)     |
| 1% increase in expected mortality rate             | 1,353     |
| 1% decrease in expected mortality rate             | (1,249)   |

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of expected cash flows, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

# 35.15 Significant risk associated with the staff retirement benefit schemes include:

Asset volatility: The risk of the investment underperforming and being not sufficient to meet the liabilities. The duration of the liabilities is 10 Years. Based on the weighted average duration of this plan and guidance from Pakistan Society of Actuaries (“PSOA”), the discount rate used for the calculations is 14.25% per annum.

Inflation risk: The risk that the final salary at the time of cessation of service is greater than what we assumed. Since the benefit is calculated on the final salary (which will closely reflect inflation and other macroeconomic factors), the benefit amount increases as salary increases.

Mortality rate: The risk that the actual mortality experience is different than the assumed mortality. This effect is more pronounced in schemes where the age and service distribution is on the higher side.

Withdrawal rate: The risk of actual withdrawals experience is different from assumed withdrawal probability. The significance of the withdrawal risk varies with the age, service and the entitled benefits of the beneficiary.

# 38. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than investment those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings are frequently repriced.

# 38.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

# Financial Instruments Analysis

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values of non-financial assets within level 3

Fixed assets and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claim: Fixed assets and non-banking assets are valued by professionally qualified valuators. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. In determining the valuation for land and building the valuer refers to numerous independent market inquiries from local estate agents / realtors in the vicinity to establish the present market value. The fair valuation of land and building are considered to represent a level 3 valuation based on significant non-observable inputs being the location and condition of the assets. The fair value is subject to change owing to changes in input. However, management does not expect there to be a material sensitivity to the fair value arising from the non-observable inputs.

# 43. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management aspects are embedded in the holding company’s strategy, organization structure and processes. The holding company has adopted a cohesive risk management structure for credit, market, liquidity and operational risk with an integrated approach to strengthen the process and system as controls are more effective and valuable when built into the process. Effective risk management is considered essential in the preservation of the assets and long-term profitability of the holding company. Clear guidelines and limits, which are under regular review, are backed by a system of internal controls and independent audit inspections. Internal reporting / MIS are additional tools for measuring and controlling risks. Separation of duties is also embedded in the holding company’s system and organization.

# 43.1 Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a transaction may default. It arises principally in relation to the lending and trade finance business carried out by the holding company.

As per Basel II methodology the gross credit risk weighted exposure incorporating relevant credit conversion factor is Rs. 453,494,099 thousand (2021: Rs. 406,395,001 thousand) as depicted in note 42.

The Group’s strategy is to minimize credit risk through a strong pre-disbursement credit analysis, approval and risk measurement process added with product, geography and customer diversification. The holding company, as its strategic preference, extends trade and working capital financing, so as to keep the major portion of exposure (funded and non-funded) on a short-term, self-liquidating basis. Major portion of the holding company's credit portfolio is priced on flexible basis with pricing reviewed on periodic basis.

With the expansion of the Consumer lending portfolio, the Credit Review & Administration efforts have been accordingly enhanced by inducting specialized consumer credit risk analysts and processing specialists.

Centralized Credit and Trade processing centres staffed with experienced resource provide strength to post-disbursement aspect of credit risk management.

The Group’s credit policy / manual defines the credit extension criteria, the credit approval and monitoring process, the loan classification system and provisioning policy.

The Group continually assesses and monitors credit exposures. The group follows both objective and subjective criteria of SBP regarding loans classification. The subjective assessment process is based on management's judgement with respect to the borrower's character, activity, cash flow, capital structure, security, quality of management and delinquency.

The Group uses the 'Standardised Approach' in calculation of credit risk and capital requirements.

# Credit Risk Management

The Group uses reputable and the SBP approved rating agencies for deriving risk weight to specific credit exposures. These are applied consistently across the Group credit portfolio for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. The methodology applied for using External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI's) inclusive of the alignment of alpha numeric scale of each agency used with risk bucket is as per the SBP guidelines as is given below:

The forms of collateral that are deemed eligible under the ‘Simple Approach’ to credit risk mitigation as per the SBP guidelines are used by the Group and primarily includes cash, government, equity investment in blue chip companies and rated debt securities. The Group applies the SBP specified haircut to collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral management is embedded in the Group’s risk taking and risk management policy and procedures. A standard credit granting procedure exists which has been well-disseminated down the line, ensuring proper pre-sanction evaluation, adequacy of security, pre-examination of charge/control documents and monitoring of each exposure on an ongoing basis. Collateral information is recorded diligently in the Group's main processing systems by type of collateral, amount of collateral against relevant credit exposures. A cohesive accounting/risk management system facilitates effective collateral management for Basel II reporting.

# 43.2.2 Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is the probability of loss resulting from adverse movement in exchange rates.

The holding company’s business model for foreign exchange risk is to serve trading activities of its clients in an efficient and cost effective manner. The holding company is not in the business of actively trading and market making activities and all FX exposures are backed by customer's trade transaction. A conservative risk approach backed by holding company’s business strategy to work with export oriented clients gives the ability to meet its foreign exchange needs.

Interest rate risk is also controlled through flexible credit pricing mechanism and variable deposit rates. Duration analysis and stress testing are being carried out regularly to estimate the impact of adverse changes in the interest rates on bank's fixed income portfolio. Optimization of yield is achieved through the Group’s investment strategy which aims on attaining a balance between yield and liquidity under the strategic guidance of the ALCO. The advances and deposits of the Group are repriced on a periodic basis based on interest rates scenario.

# 9. Deduction of Withholding Tax from Dividend

The Government of Pakistan through Finance Act, 2020 has made certain amendments in section 150 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 whereby different rates are prescribed for deduction of withholding tax on the amount of dividend paid by the companies. These tax rates are as under:

- (a) For filers of income tax returns: 15%
- (b) For non-filers of income tax returns: 30%


To enable the Bank to make tax deduction on the amount of cash dividend @ 15% instead of 30%, all shareholders whose names are not entered in the Active Tax-Payers List (ATL) provided on the website of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), despite the fact that they are filers, are advised to make sure that their names are entered into ATL at the earliest possible (as and when declared) otherwise tax on their cash dividend will be deducted @ 30%.

For shareholders holding their shares jointly as per the clarification issued by the FBR withholding tax will be determined separately on 'Filer/Non-Filer' status of Principal Shareholder as well as joint-holder(s) based on their shareholding proportions. Therefore, all shareholders who hold shares jointly are required to provide shareholding proportions of Principal Shareholder and Joint-holder(s) in respect of shares held by them follows:

| Folio / CDC account no. | Total shares | Principal Shareholder | Joint Shareholder(s)                    |                   |                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
