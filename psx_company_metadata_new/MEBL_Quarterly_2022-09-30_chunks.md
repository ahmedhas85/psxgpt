# Economy

After staging an impressive GDP growth of 6.0% in FY22, Pakistan's economy is expected to slow down in FY23 due to economic challenges – as the balance of payments pressures, fiscal slippages, high inflation, restrictions on non-essential imports, and resumption of IMF program have triggered sharp monetary and fiscal tightening. The tough global macro environment arising out of Russia–Ukraine conflict and commodity super cycle – particularly oil prices have added to economic imbalances. Domestic inflation rose substantially, which prompted the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to tighten monetary policy by raising the policy rate to 15 percent. The situation was further exacerbated by the unprecedented flooding in Pakistan during the 3rd Quarter resulting in more than 30 million people being rendered homeless and over eight hundred thousand heads of cattle washed away. Agriculture, especially in the province of Sind has also been very badly affected.

To fill the widening fiscal gap, the Federal Government has increased the income taxes on select corporate sectors, including the banking industry, through the Federal Budget 2022-23. The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board also completed its combined seventh and eighth reviews of the Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan and disbursed US$1.1 billion which strengthened the country’s foreign exchange reserves.

The Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) budgeted revenue target for the first quarter of the current financial year has been surpassed. Pakistan Rupee–US Dollar parity has improved lately while commodity prices have started coming down. Pakistan’s anticipated removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list should also bode well for the economy. We are hopeful that the Government’s focus to address domestic and external imbalances and commitment to implementing fiscal discipline in the country will lay the foundation for inclusive and sustainable growth.

# Our performance

By the grace of Allah, Meezan Bank continued to deliver strong financial results during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Profit after tax registered a growth of 46% to Rs 28.6 billion from Rs 19.6 billion in corresponding period last year. This was achieved despite the higher taxation charge levied under the Finance Act 2022 by the Federal Government – the effective tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2022 increased to 49% versus 40% in September 2021.

Basic Earnings per Share for the nine months period, on enhanced share capital of Rs 17.9 billion, increased to Rs 15.98 per share from Rs 10.93 per share in September 2021. The Bank remains sufficiently capitalized with Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 19.19% – well above the minimum regulatory requirement. We are pleased to inform you that the Board has approved Rs 2.00 (2.00%) interim cash dividend for the third quarter. This brings the total dividend payout for the nine months period to Rs 5.50 (55%) as Rs 3.50 per share (35%) interim cash dividend was paid for the first half of 2022. This is in addition to the 10% bonus shares issued in the last quarter.

Return on financings, investments and placements increased by 98% to Rs 153.9 billion from Rs 77.6 billion in the corresponding period last year, contributed by both a higher volume of earning assets and a higher benchmark Policy Rate which, on average, increased from 7.01% in the corresponding period last year to 12.47% during the nine months ended September 2022. On the other hand, the return on deposits and other dues recorded an increase of 164% closing at Rs 76.7 billion from Rs 29.1 billion in the corresponding period last year.

## Chunk 8


# DIRECTORS' REVIEW

The Bank’s operating and other expenses also increased by 33% to Rs 34 billion from Rs 25.6 billion, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the opening of 91 new branches since September 2021, a substantial rise in inflation, and a steep rupee devaluation. However, it is heartening to note that notwithstanding the increase in operating and other expenses, the Bank’s income efficiency ratio improved to 37% from 44% in the corresponding period last year on the back of its continued focus on cost rationalization and efficient operating cycle.

The total assets of the Bank reached Rs 2.45 trillion, after registering a growth of 29% (Rs 544 billion), from December 2021 levels of Rs 1.91 trillion. The investment portfolio of the Bank doubled, growing to Rs 1.2 trillion from Rs 620 billion last year, after an investment of more than Rs 600 billion in GoP Ijarah Sukuk. The resumption of GoP Ijarah Sukuk has provided necessary liquidity deployment instruments for the Islamic Banking Industry and we are hopeful that this program will remain in place in line with SBP’s 5 year strategic plan to grow the Islamic Banking Industry.

The Bank was able to grow its gross financings book to Rs 873 billion – an increase of 12% over Rs 777 billion in December 2021. The growth is well-distributed across all segments in line with the Bank’s strategic objective to maintain a high-quality diversified asset portfolio spread across top-tier corporates, mid-tier commercials, small and medium-sized entities and consumer segments. The Bank is also actively extending Islamic financing under export refinance, long-term financing facility, financing for renewable energy, temporary economic refinance for plant and machinery, SME Asaan Finance, etc.

During the nine months ended 30th September 2022, the Bank made an additional general provision of Rs 1.75 billion against potential non-performing financings and decline in borrowers’ repayment capacity given the current economic slowdown and the impact of the recent unprecedented floods. The Bank’s non-performing financing ratio has slightly improved to 1.5% against an overall banking industry average of around 7%. The Bank maintains a comfortable level of provisions against its non-performing financings with a coverage ratio of 154% - one of the highest in the Banking industry. The Bank does not foresee any adverse impact as a result of its implementation of IFRS 9.

As part of its deposit management strategy, the Bank’s current account deposit recorded a growth of 17% from the last year-end to close at Rs 781 billion. Current account deposits now represent 47% – a substantial part of its total deposit base. The Bank’s saving accounts also crossed Rs 595 billion bringing its total CASA deposits to 83% of total deposits, amounting to Rs 1.37 trillion as of September 30, 2022 vs Rs 1.21 trillion last year. On an overall basis, the deposits of the Bank grew by 14% or Rs 202 billion closing at Rs 1.66 trillion as of 30th September 2022 from Rs 1.46 trillion last year. The Bank continues to maintain its leadership in Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) with a market share of 25% in terms of total inflows through this channel, representing $1.2 billion in foreign remittances.

The Bank continues to focus on a hybrid growth model underpinned by expanding its physical presence in underserved areas of the country whilst simultaneously augmenting its digital footprint through innovative offerings and smooth channel migration. The Bank has added 38 new branches to its network since December 2021, bringing its branch network size to 940 branches with a presence in more than 307 cities. 61 new ATMs were also added over the same period and the Bank now operates with an extensive network of 1,000 plus ATMs. Meezan recently launched Pakistan’s first digital supply chain financing platform ‘Wisaaq’ that digitizes business payments to enable a cashless and digital supply chain for distributors, enabling them to avail Shariah-compliant financing facilities to meet their working capital requirements. The Bank’s acquiring business has also expanded to 212 cities in the country which would foster and accelerate the digital payments landscape of the country.


D I R E C T O R S ' R E V I E W

VIS Credit Rating Company Limited has reaffirmed the entity ratings of the Bank at ‘AAA/A-1+’ (Triple A/ A-One Plus) which denotes the highest credit quality, with negligible risk factors. The outlook on the assigned ratings is ‘Stable’.

# Outlook

The Bank remains committed to contributing to the economic growth and stability of the country by strengthening the Islamic Banking Industry (IBI) and assisting the government to shift toward Shariah-compliant banking solutions in line with the SBP’s strategic vision to increase the market share of IBI to 30% by 2025 from its current level of around 20%. The Bank will continue to strengthen its equity base in line with its future growth plans while maintaining adequate buffers over regulatory requirements.

The Board would like to express its sincere thanks and gratitude to the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, and the Ministry of Finance for their continuous commitment to establishing a viable Islamic financial system in the country. We would also like to thank our shareholders, Board members, Members of the Shariah Board, holders of Additional Tier I Sukuk and Sub-ordinated Sukuk (Tier II) and each one of our staff members for their hard work, commitment and support without which these results would not have been made possible. Most importantly, we are thankful to Allah Almighty for His blessings on our Bank which have enabled us to achieve this in a very short period. We pray that He gives us more strength and wisdom to further expand our Vision of establishing Islamic banking as banking of first choice in Pakistan.

On behalf of the Board

# Tax Matters

The Income Tax Department has amended the deemed assessment orders of the Bank for prior years including the tax year 2021. The additions / disallowances were mainly due to allocation of expenses relating to dividends and capital gain, allowability of provision against loans and advances, provision against investments and provision against other assets. In the amended order for tax year 2015, additional issues with respect to the taxability of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches have also been raised. The Bank has obtained stay order from the High Court of Sindh against the demands raised through the amended order for the tax year 2015. Both the Bank and the department have filed appeals with the Appellate Authorities in respect of aforementioned matters.

The management of the Bank, in consultation with its tax advisors, is confident that the decision in respect of the above matters would be in Bank’s favour and accordingly no provision has been made in this financial information with respect thereto. The additional tax liability in respect of gain on bargain purchase and non-adjustment of loss pertaining to HSBC Bank Middle East – Pakistan Branches is Rs 1,096 million and Rs 706 million respectively.

The fair value of GoP Ijarah Sukuk quoted are derived using PKISRV rates. The PKISRV rates are announced by FMA (Financial Market Association) through Reuters. The rates announced are simple average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.

The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by SBP.

The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Bloomberg.

The valuation has been determined through closing rates of Pakistan Stock Exchange.

The valuation has been determined based on Net asset values declared by respective funds.

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

Fair value of Islamic financing and related assets, unquoted sukuk, other assets, other liabilities and fixed term deposits and other accounts and due to financial institutions cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments. The provision for impairment of Islamic financing and related assets has been made in accordance with the Bank’s accounting policy as stated in note 6.3.2 to the 2021 annual financial statements.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are short term in nature or in the case of financings and deposits are frequently repriced.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims have been carried at revalued amounts determined by professional valuers (level 3 measurement) based on their assessment of the market values as disclosed in note 14. The valuations are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of State Bank of Pakistan. The valuation experts used a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach used prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in this financial information.
