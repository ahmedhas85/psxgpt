# Economic Update

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its meeting held on October 10, 2022, decided to maintain the policy rate at 15.00% citing continued deceleration in economic activity, decline in headline inflation and current account deficit since the last meeting. The MPC was of the view that the ‘existing monetary policy stance strikes an appropriate balance between managing inflation and maintaining growth in the wake of the floods.’ The average inflation for 1QFY23 stood at 25.1%, as headline inflation, after a peak in August, fell by more than 4% in September to 23.2 %, driven by a reduction in electricity prices. On the other hand, both core and food inflation picked up further. Looking ahead, the supply-shock to food prices from the floods is expected to put additional pressure on headline inflation in the coming months. SBP projects inflation to be slightly above its prior forecast of 18-20%. MPC also stated that the GDP growth could fall to around 2% in FY23, compared to the previous forecast of 3-4%. Externally, hawkish responses by prominent central banks have furthered recession risks as central banks around the world endeavor to tame inflation spikes and yearn to reduce the risk of hard landing.

As per the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the trade deficit for the 1QFY23 narrowed to USD 9.3 billion where exports increased by 1.8% to USD 7 billion, and imports fell by 12.7% to USD 16.3 billion. In 1QFY23, workers’ remittances fell by 6.3% YOY as it reached USD 7.7 billion. The current account deficit shrank for the second consecutive month in August to USD 0.7 billion, almost half the level in July. In line with the trade data, the USD/PKR parity appreciated to 217.79 from 239.71. Despite this appreciation, as at quarter end, SBP reserves were down to USD 7.899 billion, lowest since 2018-19. The default risk still seems to be relevant.

Third Quarter  September 30, 2022


for investors as Eurobond yields went through the roof after flood wreaked havoc, despite Pakistan having already secured an IMF tranche.

FBR tax collection surpassed the PKR 1.608 trillion target by PKR 27 billion 1QFY2023 mainly due to high headline inflation. In July, fiscal outcomes were better than in the same period last year. The fiscal deficit fell to 0.3% of GDP while the primary balance recorded a surplus of 0.2% of GDP.

Pakistan has made progress in the AML / CFT domain and after completing substantial, technical, and procedural requirements, FATF has removed Pakistan from the grey list.

Looking ahead for Pakistan, heightened uncertainty about domestic politics and devastating floods has meant that Pakistan’s Eurobonds continue to take a beating and have come under further pressure. Moody’s downgraded the government of Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from B3 with negative outlook. The expectation is that Pakistan’s credit spreads will start to narrow, and stability will follow once the funds start to become available from sources of bilateral and multilateral funding. This will ease pressure on SBP reserves while settling any debt sustainability concerns, thus dampening volatility in money, foreign exchange, and stock market.

# Third Quarter September 30, 2022


On a standalone basis, FBL has continued to deliver a strong performance in the nine months of 2022 with a record Profit Before Tax (PBT) of PKR 15.0 billion, 51% higher than the PKR 9.9 billion in the corresponding period last year. FBL has achieved the highest ever quarterly PBT growth of PKR 6.3 billion in Q3’22. However, the increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) is restricted to 26% from PKR 6.1 billion in 9m’21 to PKR 7.7 billion in 9m’22 due to excessive and retrospective tax measures announced in the Federal Budget.

The Bank continued to deliver on growth objectives and has increased the total revenue by 33% over 9m’21 to PKR 33.6 billion. Net markup income has reached PKR 26.9 billion in 9m’22, with a growth of 42% year on year underpinned by strong balance sheet expansion and improvement in overall spreads. Robust growth in current deposits of 81 billion (13%) YoY and increase in the average benchmark rate helped improving the overall spreads. Non markup income grew by 3% over corresponding period last year and is at PKR 6.6 billion in 9m’22. The growth in non-markup income was undermined due to loss on securities; excluding it, the growth in non-markup income is at 33%.

Non markup expenses of the bank have increased by 27% over 9m’21 on the back of very high inflation, PKR devaluation against USD and increase in branch network. However, the cost to income ratio has improved from 60% in 9m’21 to 57% in 9m’22. Net provision for 9m’22 reflected reversal of PKR 0.7 billion against a charge of PKR 0.2 billion in the corresponding period last year. The NPL ratio continued to reduce and is at 4.6% with total coverage at 89.5%. FBL achieved the landmark of PKR 1.0 trillion mark in total assets as a result of strong deposit mobilization and borrowings. Current Accounts momentum built over last several quarters continued and has reached PKR 274 billion, 27% growth over December 2021. Total deposits increased by 13% over December 2021 and reached PKR 725 billion, improving market share from 3.1% in December 2021 to 3.2% in September 2022. Current Account (CA) mix improved to 38% from 33% at December 2021 and CASA mix improved to 80% from 75% at December 2021.

FBL’s net advances increased by 18% to PKR 468 billion, with the ADR improving from 61% in December 2021 to 65% at September 2022. The Bank continued to generate liquidity from borrowings and invested in Sukuks, as a result investments have increased by 15% and have reached PKR 412 billion. Earnings Per Share increased to PKR 5.05, 26.2% higher than the same period last year.

# 3.5.1

The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

| Standards, interpretations or amendments                                               | Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after) |

| IFRS 9 - 'Financial instruments'                                                       | January 1, 2023\*                                     |
| IAS 1 - 'Presentation of financial statements' (amendments)                            | January 1, 2024                                       |
| IAS 8 - 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (amendments) | January 1, 2023                                       |

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these standards and amendments on the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.

* The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has deferred the applicability of IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and has also issued detailed application guidelines for implementation of IFRS 9. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than 'incurred credit losses' approach. The ECL has an impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is currently being assessed based on the detailed application guidelines issued by the SBP.

# 34 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 34.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

| Forward foreign exchange contracts                    | The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan. The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. |
| Mutual funds                                          | Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Fixed assets (land and buildings)                     | Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims | NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Company from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Company by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Company in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the Subsidiary Company are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

The following revised standards, amendments and interpretations with respect to the accounting and reporting standards would be effective from the dates mentioned below against the respective standards, amendments or interpretations:

| Standards, interpretations or amendments                                                 | Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

The management is in the process of assessing the impact of these standards and amendments on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

* The SBP vide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022 has deferred the applicability of IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and has also issued detailed application guidelines for implementation of IFRS 9. The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than 'incurred credit losses' approach. The ECL has an impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk. The impact of the application of IFRS 9 in Pakistan on the Bank's financial statements is currently being assessed based on the detailed application guidelines issued by the SBP.

| (i)                               | Income tax assessments of the Holding Company have been finalised upto the tax year 2020 (accounting year 2019). Income tax return for TY 2022 (accounting year 2021) has been filed within stipulated timeline. The department and the Holding Company has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2021: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) \[CIR(A)] has deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department has filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). Recently, ATIR has passed an order and maintain the decision of CIR(A) in favor of Holding Company, confirming that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                   |
| (ii)                              | There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 29,736 million (December 31, 2021: Rs 30,799 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Holding Company from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Holding Company was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Holding Company for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Holding Company's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299 million (December 31, 2021: 25,299 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Holding Company for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages. Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Holding Company's favour and the possibility of any outcome against the Holding Company is remote and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. |                   |

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.673 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

# 35 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified as held to maturity, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified as held to maturity are carried at cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available audited financial statements.

The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 35.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

Notes to and forming part of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Un-audited) For the nine months ended September 30, 2022

Item

Valuation approach and input used

Forward foreign exchange contracts

The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.

The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.

Mutual funds

Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 3

Item

Valuation approach and input used

Fixed assets (land and building)

Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims

NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market-based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
